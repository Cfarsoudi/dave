                                                           SEVENTH DRAFT
                                                         3 FEBRUARY 1999




FADE IN:

MAIN CREDITS ROLL

over BLACK SCREEN, with PORTENTOUS SPOOKY MUSIC underneath. Just as the
music reaches its crescendo, we hear a simian SCREECH.

A BUCK-TOOTHED CARTOON MONKEY swings past on a vine. TITLE WIPES IN with
him:

                             MONKEYBONE(tm)
                                   in
                            "FREUD CHICKEN!"

TIGHT CLOSEUP - STANLEY (ANIMATED)

A POCKETWATCH swings back and forth in F.G. Gaping at it is a goofy,
bespectacled CARTOON CHARACTER, sucking his thumb as his EYES move back
and forth. After a moment, the LEFT EYE freezes in place - but the right
eye keeps going back and forth with the watch.

                           SHRINK'S VOICE (o.s.)
            Back, Stanley...you're going back...back to when
            it all began. Are you going back yet? Come on,
            get back, ve haven't got all day.

Now BOTH EYES are locked in place. The patient is hypnotized.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - DAY (ANIMATED)

A squat, lumpy TEACHER, MISS HUDLAPP, is straining to erase the
Gettysburg Address, which is written along the very top of the
blackboard. There's an obtrusive, rhythmic BANGING noice in B.G.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It was third grade. The teacher was Miss
            Hudlapp. She was kinda squat and lumpy - she
            smelled funny - but she was kind.

                           MISS HUDLAPP
            CLASS!
                 (turning around suddenly)
            How many times have I told you? In this class we
            do not pound tenpenny nails into Stanley's head!


REVERSE ANGLE - ON STANLEY

Hapless ten-year-old STANLEY, still goofy and bespectacled, in his
front-row desk. NAILS stick out of his head. The FOUR MEAN KIDS poised
around him lower their hammers and return to their seats, grumbling.

A dreamy SMILE crosses STANLEY's face as he gazes at MISS HUDLAPP.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            You know how some teachers have those, kind of,
            flaps on their arms - those big sacks of limp
            flab that like, dangle?

As MISS HUDLAPP pulls her sweater off, TWO MASSIVE ARM-FLAPS - fifty
gallons of flab apiece - SPILL OUT and SMACK INTO THE FLOOR.

MISS HUDDLAPP claps two erasers together, kicking up a cloud of dust.
Young STANLEY watches, transfixed by her massive ARM FLAPS. We TRACK IN
on the gigantic ARM FLAPS as they swing hypnotically back and forth,
with a loud SLAP each time they collide.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It sounds weird...but for some reason, as I
            watched those big old flaps of hers, I began to
            feel...well...oddly...

Now we TRACK IN on the mesmerized STANLEY. A SONG comes up underneath:
Donna Summer, "I FEEL LOVE."

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            ...aroused.
                 (beat)
            And then the horror began.

DOINK! STANLEY looks down at his LAP in horror. The boys and girls
around him are pointing and tittering.

Grimacing in embarrassment, he discreetly places a heavy TEXTBOOK onto
his lap, suppressing the bulge in his pants. But SPROING!! - the BOOK
goes flying across the room. The BULGE is fighting back!

The kids DUCK AND COVER beneath their desks as STANLEY slams a STACK of
textbooks onto his lap. It's no use - the WHOLE STACK goes flying, and
BOOKS come raining down on the entire class! Now MISS HUDLAPP is staring
directly at him...

                           MISS HUDLAPP
            Young man. What's that in your lap?

She marches toward him. STANLEY pulls his BACKPACK over his lap.

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            It was useless. Like putting a baseball cap on
            the Washington Monument. And then...all at once
            ...there he was.

The BACKPACK bucks and wriggles, as if something inside is trying to GET
OUT. And then - with a flourish of rousing disco strings - IT DOES!

                           STANLEY (V.O.)
            Monkeybone!!

The libidinous cartoon monkey BURSTS OUT of the backpack, POINTS at MISS
HUDLAPP - and announces, in his Barry White baritone:

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oooo-oo-ooh, baby. I love your way.

KC and the SUNSHINE BAND comes up underneath as MONKEYBONE DANCES to the
front of the class. He grabs MISS HUDLAPP by the hands and begins
dancing The Bump with her ARM FLAPS. Butt left, WHAP. Butt right, WHAP.

The KIDS are bug-eyed - agog. With each WHAP their little heads turn
back and forth as if they're watching a nude tennis match.


INT. SCREENING ROOM - ON AUDIENCE (LIVE-ACTION)

A roomful of LIVE HUMANS watching the cartoon, heads turning in sync
with the kids onscreen. TV-INDUSTRY HIPSTERS, AD EXECS, MANUFACTURER'S
REPS...they're all guests at this sneak preview of the Monkeybone show,
and they're LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.

In the midst of the crowd is a handsome young couple: JULIE McELROY and
STU MILEY. JULIE's a research scientist, brainy, professional,
abnormally well-adjusted - and pretty enough that she'd be intimidating
if it weren't for a prominent goofy streak.

STU is the one guy in the auditorium who isn't laughing at the cartoon
on the screen. In fact, he's solemn as a judge - peering nervously
around to see how the rest of the audience is responding.

Why? Because he's the cartoonist who created the characters on screen.
In his looks (gangly, disheveled) and manner (sardonic, self-
deprecating), he's the obvious model for the character of STANLEY.

INT. CLASSROOM (ANIMATED)

As the monkey dance continues, we ZOOM IN on the mortified face of
LITTLE STANLEY. His eyes begin doing the familiar HYPNO-SWIRL...

INT. SHRINK'S OFFICE (ANIMATED)

A CUCKOO pops out of a wall clock. ADULT STANLEY'S THUMB pops out of his
mouth. He awakens from his trance in a cold sweat.

                           STANLEY
            How about it, Doc? Can you help me?

                           SHRINK
            Not overnight. These imaginary monkey cases take
            time. I vould estimate...roughly...

On the desk is a CATALOGUE, open to a two-page spread depicting a 40-
foot CABIN CRUISER. "NEW FOR SUMMER! ONLY $229,999.95!" With his free
hand, the SHRINK is working a CALCULATOR...

                           SHRINK
            Twelve years and three months ought to do it.

The SHRINK hustles STANLEY to the door and shakes his hand.

                           STANLEY
            One question, doc - what did you mean when you
            said "imaginary"?

                           SHRINK
            All in good time, my boy. All in good time.

The SHRINK shoves STANLEY out and slams the door behind him. Two beats.
Then he doubles over, WEEPING with LAUGHTER.

                           SHRINK
            Vot a crackpot! Monkey on ze back - HAH!! ROLL
            OUT ZE WACKY WAGON!!

Now he notices a BACKPACK, which STANLEY has left on the couch. It
TWITCHES slightly - of its own free will.

                           VOICE IN BACKPACK
            Imaginary, huh? You quack.


EXT. SHRINK'S BUILDING (ANIMATED)

A WINDOW shatters. The SHRINK comes hurtling out. MONKEYBONE STRADDLES
HIM like Slim Pickens riding an H-bomb, hootin' and hollerin' all the
way down to the street.

SPLAT! A gob of gore hits STANLEY in the face as he exits the building.
He kneels on the sidewalk - finding a PIPE and a GOATEE.

                           STANLEY
            Aw, Monkeybone! At this rate I'll never find a
            good shrink.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Those guys are a waste of money! I'll show you
            how to stop sucking your thumb...

MONKEYBONE sticks his thumb in his butt as he and STANLEY toddle off
into the sunset.

INT. SCREENING ROOM - THAT MOMENT

STANDING O from the crowd as the cartoon ends and the lights come up.
HERB, an all-purpose sidekick type, appears at the podium:

                           HERB
            Thank you...that's our pilot...the good news is,
            Comedy Channel has just picked us up with an
            order for six new episodes!

HERB leads a round of APPLAUSE. JULIE nudges STU - the only guy in the
room who's still in his seat.

                           HERB
            Now, let's give it up for the guy who started it
            all. Creator of America's most disturbed comic
            strip...the man behind the monkey...Mister Stu
            Miley!

A SPOTLIGHT hits him, and he STANDS to tumultuous applause. He looks
genuinely stunned. He can't believe it's happening.

JULIE surreptitiously PINCHES him on the bottom, giving him a start. She
WINKS at him. He shoots her a small private smile - then turns to WAVE
at the adoring crowd.

INT. LOBBY - HALF-HOUR LATER - NIGHT

STU working his way through a crowd of well-wishers and FANS.

                           STU
            I don't actually draw all the animation, no. We
            have sweatshop workers who couldn't get jobs at
            Nike doing that.

A beautiful, heavily-pierced FEMALE FAN hands STU a marker.

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            Mr. Miley, would you draw Monkeybone on my
            belly? As a guide?

                           STU
            Guide...?

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            For my tattoo artist?

She exposes her taut midriff. STU thinks for a moment, then goes to
work. When he's done, Monkeybone appears to be climbing out of the
girl's pants and WAVING to her. Nearby FANS APPLAUD.

                           BEAUTIFUL FAN
            Wait! You have to draw the rest of him -

She begins unbuckling her belt so STU will have enough room to draw
Monkeybone's bottom half. STU demurs...

                           STU
            I - I have to, uh, check in with my doctor. DO-
            OCCCC!!

He wanders across the room, finds JULIE deep in conversation with a
bunch of other GUESTS, and pulls her aside.

                           STU
            Hey, Doc. Come here. There's something really
            cool I want to show you.

He grabs her by the sleeve, pulls her across the floor to -

INT. ALCOVE - OFF LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

There's nothing "cool" about it - it's a stairway landing, with metal
fire doors that open onto the parking lot outside.

                           STU
            See these doors? The cool thing is, you go out
            ...they close...you can't get back in!

He opens one door and holds it for JULIE.

                           JULIE
            You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit!
            Everyone loves you!

                           STU
            They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.

                           JULIE
            It was you who got the standing O. It was you
            drawing on the belly over there...

                           STU
            That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I
            don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of
            media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone!
                 (conspiratorially)
            I have something I have to give you.

                           JULIE
            Can't you give it to me later?

                           STU
            Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got
            here sooner, it would be...better.

He gives up trying to explain...pulls her close and kisses her. For a
moment they completely forget about the party in the next room.

Then HERB appears behind them, trying to catch STU's eye as he waits for
the clinch to break up. Finally he pries them apart:

                           HERB
            Sorry, Julie - won't be a minute. Now Stu - I
            know you don't like the idea, but you really
            ought to talk to these guys -

                           STU
            Julie and I - we were just gonna go...

But before STU knows what's hit him, HERB is leading him back to -


INT. LOBBY - THAT MOMENT - CONTINUOUS

                           HERB
            Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You
            got three major toy companies...you got the guys
            from Burger God over here...

                           STU
            Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in
            the french fries?

                           HERB
            Never proven. They're ready to pop for a pre-
            emptive endorsement. Kids love Burger God -

The MERCHANDISERS shoot STU an expectant wave. STU waves back and turns
in the opposite direction. HERB grabs him by the sleeve.

                           STU
            Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.

                           HERB
            Do you know what kind of opportunity you have
            here? You gotta strike. I'm talking mansions.
            Lamborghinis. Champagne for mouthwash when you
            brush your teeth!

                           STU
            I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!

                           HERB
            Being rich is not a trap. That is a dirty lie
            perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures
            from killing them.

                           STU
            Herb. I have to go.

                           HERB
            Why?

                           STU
            I got the ring.
                 (beat)
            Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.

He nods toward JULIE, who's at the open bar grabbing two glasses of
punch. HERB realizes a proposal is in the works.

                           HERB
            Oh my God...you're proposing?

                           STU
            My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she...
            fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never
            been. She loves me the way I am - right now.
                 (beat)

            I don't want everything to change. I don't want
            her saying yes to some big success. I just want
            her saying yes to me.

                           HERB
            ...In some weird way I respect that.

JULIE's over by the punchbowl. She sees the two boys staring at her
conspiratorially - MAKES A FACE at them as she waves back.

                           HERB
            Okay then. If I get you out of here - you pop
            the question - tonight. Or else. Get me?

STU nods gravely.

EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

STU, JULIE, and HERB in the parking lot. A small safari of FLUNKIES is
loading enormous boxes full of MONKEYBONE JUNK into STU's beat-up car -
stuffed dolls, action figures, board games, lunchboxes, beach towels,
team jackets and more! STU groans at the sight of it...

                           HERB
            They're just prototypes...take 'em home and look
            at 'em before you say no...
                 (scanning the streets)
            If you could just hold on a minute or two, we're
            expecting a couple more trucks.

STU GLOWERS at HERB as he opens the car door for JULIE.

                           HERB
            Okay, okay! You're a beautiful couple. Go.

INT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

STU backs out of his space. The small parking lot is full of DELIVERY
TRUCKS from would-be merchandisers - all too large for the spaces
they're parked in. STU has to keep backing up because the exit lanes are
blocked. It's like negotiating a labyrinth.

                           STU
            Look at this! He won't let us leave!

                           JULIE
            Who?

                           STU
            The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over
            both our lives if we let him.

                           JULIE
            Stu - stop it. That monkey is good luck. You
            thought him up, and everybody loves him, and
            he's probably going to make you rich. So relax!
            Enjoy it!

                           STU
            I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had
            any good luck, until I met you...what if it's
            all just another bad dream?

                           JULIE
            What's the "bad" part?

                           STU
            I might wake up.

                           JULIE
                 (laughing; taking his hand)

            If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So
            face it. You're just going to have to be happy!

                           STU
            I am happy. It just so happens this is the
            happiest night of my life.

He says it so solemnly that she cracks up. After a moment he joins in.

EXT. PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

A PLASTIC BANNER stretches between two poles on either side of the entry
to the lot. It shows MONKEYBONE in a typical languorous pose:

                  It's His World. We Just Live in It!
                               MONKEYBONE
                        Sunday Nights This Fall

TWO GUYS on EXTENSION LADDERS are taking the sign down as STU'S CAR
idles at the exit below. There's a strong wind tonight, and one guy
LOSES HOLD of his end of the banner just as he gets it detached...

INT. CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

As STU pulls into the intersection he sees a DELIVERY TRUCK approaching
in the opposite lane, with a cardboard likeness of MONKEYBONE mounted
atop the cab. He chuckles...

                           STU
            That damn monkey is everywh--

Suddenly his view of the street DISAPPEARS. The MONKEYBONE BANNER has
fallen DIRECTLY ACROSS HIS WINDSHIELD, like a huge SHROUD. All he can
see is a great, grinning MONKEY FACE!!

JULIE SCREAMS. STU SCREAMS. Unable to see, he slams on the brakes and
JERKS THE WHEEL RIGHT.

Off screen: HORNS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. The horrible crunch of METAL
ON METAL.

But Stu's car comes to a halt untouched. After a moment he opens his
eyes...and JULIE opens hers...

                           STU
            Did we just - hit something?

                           JULIE
            I don't think so.

                           STU
            Are you okay??

She thinks it over, nods. STU takes a moment to catch his breath, then
opens the door gingerly. A HORN BLARES as a car speeds past in the
opposite lane, nearly taking STU's door off. He jumps back inside,
waits, opens the door again...

EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT

His eyes widen in horror as he steps out to survey the scene. The
asphalt is strewn with MONKEYBONE MERCHANDISE - stuffed dolls, games,
lunchboxes. SKID MARKS show where the TRUCK which was carrying all this
SWERVED...

...and slammed into the rear of a BUICK REGAL, pinning it up against a
TELEPHONE POLE. STU races up to the Buick. Its front end is mashed up
like an accordion, but the occupants - a couple of TEENAGERS dressed for
the prom - seem to be okay.

                           STU
            Hey! Are you guys all right in there?

                           TEENAGE GIRL
            We're fine.

                           STU
            That stupid monkey banner! It fell on my
            windshield - it practically killed us all!
                 (to JULIE)
            God, Julie, if anything had happened to you -

                           JULIE
            I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.

                           STU
            I'd better go report this...

He spots a PHONE BOOTH and starts across the street. On the way there he
plucks a STUFFED MONKEYBONE DOLL off the pavement and CHOKES IT with
both hands.

JULIE stays behind with the prom kids. The TEENAGE BOY in his tux is
glassy-eyed, miserable beyond description.

                           JULIE
            Dad's car?

The BOY begins to SOB softly. JULIE nods in sympathy.

Then: EVERYONE WINCES. The air is full of a horrible CREAKING noise,
like nails on a blackboard...

                           TEENAGE GIRL
            What was that? Did you hear that?

The horrible CREAKING NOISE continues. JULIE turns. Behind her, the
TELEPHONE POLE that the car slammed into is beginning to TEETER. Then it
TOPPLES. Directly toward...

                           JULIE
            STU!!

ON STU - IN PHONE BOOTH

He sees JULIE running toward him and holds up a single finger.

                           STU
            Operator? I want to report an accident.

Finally he glances up - just in time to see the TELEPHONE POLE coming
down toward the phone booth like a gigantic sledgehammer. His eyes
widen. The STUFFED MONKEYBONE slips from his grasp...

CLOSEUP - MONKEYBONE

A HORRIBLE CRASH. SCREAMS. CAMERA ZEROES IN on the MONKEYBONE DOLL which
STU was holding, surrounded by broken glass, its face twisted into an
insane, almost macabre grin.

The screen fades to PITCH BLACK for a few seconds...until we hear a
DISTANT SIREN, and an IMAGE comes swimming into focus...

STU'S POV: ON JULIE

He's in the back of an ambulance, with PARAMEDICS all around him,
working feverishly. JULIE hovers above him, holding his hand.

                           JULIE
            Stu? I'm here, baby. It's me. It's Julie. I love
            you. You're gonna be okay, baby, I promise -

All at once he seems to be RECEDING from JULIE and the others - as if
SINKING THROUGH the bottom of the stretcher, and BEYOND - through the
floor of the ambulance! JULIE's voice grows weaker, more distant:

                           JULIE (V.O.)
            I'm here, baby. I won't leave you...

And then all trace of the ambulance is gone, and he's floating down
through some strange LIMBO, surrounded by the silhouettes of billowing
SHROUDS, with the sound of BIRDS CALLING all around him...

An AWFUL MECHANICAL RATCHETING NOISE fills the soundtrack. STU's eyes
close - and when they reopen, he finds himself in:

EXT. TROLLEY - MOVING

A tiny ROLLER-COASTER CAR descends from dense clouds down the length of
an impossibly long and rickety METAL TRACK. The track leads through a
vast black VOID...

...to a tiny ISLAND floating in the darkness...an island that looks not
unlike a disembodied FIST.

And, as the car draws closer, the fist begins to OPEN - tulip-like -
turning into a HAND, with a full-sized TOWN nestled in its palm! In the
town, CARNIVAL LIGHTS begin to glitter. MUSIC begins to tinkle...


EXT. PLATFORM - NIGHT

The car - a one-passenger job with a CARTOON ANIMAL FACE on its prow -
stops with a lurch. STU steps out onto a fog-shrouded TRAIN STATION
PLATFORM. Before he knows it, the little car DEPARTS behind him. He's
stranded - alone.

                           STU
            Hello? Anybody? - Am I dead?
                 (beat)
            PLEASE. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF I'M DEAD.

Off in the fog is a big wheeled CART with the sign: "PSYCHOLOGICAL
BAGGAGE CLAIM." There STU finds two SUITCASES and a BACKPACK. He
examines the TAGS. They all belong to him!

He sits on the edge of the cart, opens a SUITCASE, and pulls out...

 - A bagged copy of Marvel Comics' Conan the Barbarian #1;

 - An 8mm reel of highlights from Ray Harryhausen's Jason and the
   Argonauts, with swordfighting skeletons on the box cover;

 - A SPIRAL NOTEBOOK, its cover labelled "STU M. - GEOGRAPHY," its
   inside pages covered with drawings of dinosaurs and airplanes;

 - Transparent plastic models of "THE VISIBLE MAN" and his mate, "THE
   VISIBLE WOMAN," with a couple of spare organs that young STU never
   quite found a place for;

 - A vinyl LP of "BREAD'S GREATEST HITS," which STU quickly slips back
   into the suitcase lest anyone see it.

As he gathers his bags, he hears odd SQUEAKS and CHITTERING...

                           RACCOON (o.s.)
            Carry your bags, mister?

A STRANGE FURRY CREATURE pops out from beneath the platform and yanks on
STU's pants leg. It looks like a raccoon, but it's FLAT - an animated
pelt. Before STU has time to let out a yell, a FLAT SNAKESKIN comes
slithering out from beneath the baggage cart...

                           SNAKE
            Cigars, mister? Genuine Coobans!

STU looks down and sees a SQUASHED RABBIT humping his leg.

                           RABBIT
            Wanna meet my sister?

These bordertown types are known as ROADKILL, and they're sporting the
tire tracks to prove it. STU SCREAMS, shakes them off, and RUNS.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

A long stone STAIRWAY leads to decorative wrought-iron GATES. SHADOWY
CARVED SPHINXES sit on either side. As STU races up the steps, a
sputtering NEON SIGN comes to life overhead:

                               D RK TOWN

A FANFARE BLOWS as the creaky gates begin to part. A SPOTLIGHT hits the
SPHINXES - and they COME TO LIFE! They rise up on their hind legs, put
on boater hats. One of them blows a note on a kazoo...

                           SINGING SPHINXES
            Weeee...welcome you to Dark Town
            And while you're in your coma
            This odd amusement park-town
            Will be your Home Sweet Homa -

STU bolts THROUGH THE GATES, with the ROADKILL TRIO right on his heels.
The indignant SPHINXES exchange a look of outrage.

EXT. DARK TOWN - MIDWAY - NIGHT

It's a carny town, a tourist trap, seedy and nightmarish. Despite the
festive trappings, there's something off about it - an air of neglect
and decrepitude - as if they'd tried to turn Alcatraz into Disneyland,
and given up halfway through.

STU looks back and sees the ROADKILL gaining on him. He spots a small
group of OTHER HUMANS...

                           STU
            Help me. Please. There's animals. They -

The humans just YAWN. They're COMA VICTIMS, just like STU. He ditches
one of his SUITCASES as the ROADKILL come after him.

                           VOICE
            Pony ride, Mister?

He turns and spots a helpful-looking fellow in a COWBOY OUTFIT. The
COWBOY is in fact a CENTAUR - rider and mount rolled into one!

The characters who run this place - the BARKERS, TICKET-TAKERS, and RIDE
OPERATORS - are all weird HYBRIDS, part human, part ANIMAL. They could
be the ancient Gods of some primitive culture - reduced to working as
street entertainers in this ramshackle resort town.

STU pinballs down the street, bouncing from one shock to another:

 - JOE CAMEL, doing community service as a STREET SWEEPER -

                           JOE CAMEL
            Hey, Mister. Mister! Got a smoke?

 - a YETI selling SNO-CONES from a cart outside the MORPHEUM THEATRE.
   The marquee reads:

                        LIVE! NIGHTMARES! LIVE!
          First-Run - Continuous Performances - Popular Prices
                Rated NR-H - Not Recommended for Humans

 - A CYCLOPS working as a barker at the Penny Arcade;

 - A VIDEO RENTAL OUTLET - "BAD DREAMS VIDEO," offering your favorite
   nightmares, cult and classic, three nights for $2.95. A THREE-HEADED
   DEVIL emerges from the shop carrying a sackful of videos - and
   recognizes STU, much to his horror.

                           HEAD #1
            Hey, aren't you Stu Miley?

                           HEAD #2
            We're big fans.

                           HEAD #3
            Could we have your autograph?

Reduced to babbling hysteria, STU ducks into the nearest building. Above
the door, an ANIMATED NEON SIGN shows a happy boozer lifting his martini
glass, then falling over flat on his back, at which point his eyes are
replaced by the traditional cartoon X's. This is the COMA BAR.


INT. COMA BAR - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

STU bursts in, flattens himself against the wall as the ROADKILL skitter
past outside. He's given them the slip. He looks around.

The bar's a weird melange of styles. COMA VICTIMS ride around in
wheelchairs refurbished as BUMPER CARS, drinking cocktails from IV
bottler. A four-armed ELEPHANT GOD is at the Mighty Wurlitzer while a
MERMAID VOCALIST in a half-shell belts out the wistful lyrics of Johnny
Mercer's "DREAM." And over at the BAR...

                           BULL (o.s.)
            New in town, huh? What're you drinking?

Out of breath, STU edges toward the bar as the BARTENDER, BULL, turns
away to grab a fresh glass.

                           STU
            Chasing me - animals - horrible -

                           BULL
            Animals? What kind of animals?

STU GAGS. BULL is a full-fledged MINOTAUR, body of a man, head of a
BULL. His features are CUBIST - weirdly squashed over to one side.

                           BULL
            Yeah, I know - Picasso. Guernica, right? That's
            what everybody says - although personally, I
            don't see the resemblance. What are you
            drinking?

                           STU
            Uhh - martini?

                           BULL
            Olive or eyeball?

                           STU
            Olive. - Where exactly am I?

                           BULL
            Dark Town. Land of nightmares. I'm Bull.

                           STU
            Stu Miley.

                           BULL
            Yeah, I've seen a few of your dreams. You're
            quite a celebrity down here.

STU gives him a cockeyed look. BULL points to a MONITOR mounted over the
bar, on which a panicked man in pajamas is trying to run barefoot
through a great sticky SEA OF MOLASSES.

                           BULL
            I told you, it's the land of nightmares. Same on
            every channel...all the stuff people dream,
            after they have the extra anchovies.

He changes channels with a remote. Now we see a guy falling through
midair, arms and legs flailing, falling, falling, falling...

                           STU
            Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.

                           BULL
            Sad commentary, huh?

Now a small muffled VOICE speaks from the area of STU'S BACKPACK:

                           DISEMBODIED VOICE (o.s.)
            "Bull," huh? That's cute. What's your last name
            - "Shit"??

                           BULL
                 (turning angrily to STU)
            I beg your pardon?

                           STU
            I didn't say anything.

                           VOICE (o.s.)
            Nice face. Lemme guess. You were in a bullfight
            ...with a Mack Truck!!

STU claps both hands over his mouth to prove he's not the one talking.
BULL glowers at him, snorting STEAM out of both nostrils.

                           STU
            I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...

                           BULL
            Yo, Jumbo. We got us some kind of ventriloquist
            here.

The ELEPHANT GOD from the Wurlitzer organ comes lumbering over.

                           VOICE (o.s.)
            Well, hello, sailor. Get a lot of dates with
            that ding-dong on your face??

BULL and JUMBO rear back to PUNCH STU'S LIGHTS OUT. He's saying his
prayers when his BACKPACK begins to BULGE and QUIVER - and a SMALL FURRY
BEAST pops out, CACKLING HIS HEAD OFF!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Just kiddin', folks! Drinks for everybody -
                 (pointing at STU)

            On him!! HIYA, BOSS!!

BULL and JUMBO back off, STUNNED. The monkey grabs STU'S FACE and plants
a big wet SMOOCH right on his NOSE. STU SCREAMS.

                                                     CUT TO:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

TIGHT ON an EEG monitor. There's a sudden BLIP on the readout.

                           NURSE
            Just a spike, ma'am. It happens. It's perfectly
            natural with coma patients.

                           JULIE
            I'm a doctor too. I know this man's brain -

JULIE strokes STU's limp hand. He's COMATOSE, cocooned in a tangle of
wires and tubes. His head and shoulders are heavily bandaged. He's
hooked up to as much machinery as you can cram into one room.

                           DOCTOR
            Go home, Doctor. Rest. Come back when you can do
            us some good.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

Dead on her feet, JULIE stumbles toward the exit. As she's leaving she
passes the WAITING ROOM -

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
            Julie?

She turns and sees an older colleague from work - ALICE - waiting in the
doorway. Hovering right behind ALICE is HERB. And behind him -

It appears that almost everyone in the waiting room is a friend of JULIE
and STU's. Disheveled and groggy, they rouse themselves and make their
way over to JULIE's side. She's overcome with emotion.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - ENTRY - NIGHT

The sound of the key in the lock is met by INSANE BARKING. JULIE and
ALICE enter and are met by BUSTER, the pet basset - jumping and yipping
like crazy after 24 hours without food or human company.

                           ALICE
            Now don't pick a fight. I'm staying over.

                           JULIE
            Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and
            a half. Let me get some food...

ALICE kneels to play with the dog. She hears a sudden GASP from the
kitchen. JULIE is standing by the open refrigerator, wearing an
absolutely stricken expression...

INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

ALICE finds JULIE holding a bottle of champagne - Veuve Clicquot La
Grande Dame 1989 - all wrapped up in a bow and ribbon.

                           ALICE
            Special occasion?

                           JULIE
            I don't know. I guess it was...

She bursts into tears. ALICE sits her down at the kitchen table and
takes the champagne from her.

                           ALICE
            Don't get all poignant. We're keeping this
            bottle on ice. When he comes around you're going
            to need it.

INT. BATHROOM - LATER - NIGHT

A limp JULIE soaking in a steamy tub, one arm dangling over the side. On
the vanity is a framed PHOTO STRIP, four poses for a dollar. In the
first three, STU and JULIE are making outrageously goony faces. In the
fourth, they imitate the stern-faced farm couple from American Gothic.

She gazes at it for a long, long time. Eventually she smiles.

INT. SECOND BEDROOM/STUDIO - NIGHT

OPEN on two PHOTOS, mounted in a single frame. On the left, BUSTER
KEATON, droopy-eyed, in his familiar porkpie hat and vest. On the right,
a Photoshopped image of BUSTER THE BASSETT HOUND, in the same pose, also
wearing Keaton's hat and vest.

These photos are on the wall of the cramped room which serves as STU's
studio and JULIE's office. MONKEYBONE STRIPS are scattered across the
drafting table. ALICE is making up the sofa as a guest bed.

As she's hanging her coat in the closet she comes across an ACRYLIC
CANVAS in the back, stashed behind a battered portfolio and a box full
of spiral-bound sketchbooks. She pulls it out. She's obviously disturbed
by it, but she can't tear her eyes away...

She's still gaping at the painting when JULIE enters in a terrycloth
robe.

                           ALICE
            Who did this?

                           JULIE
            Stu. That was right about the time we met.

                           ALICE
            When he first came in to the sleep lab?

                           JULIE
            Yeah...before your time.

The canvas depicts a group of SURGEONS with the faces of wolves. They're
standing over a HUMAN PATIENT, replacing his internal organs with
MACHINE PARTS. The style is at once cartoony and unsettling.

                           ALICE
            Jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing
            him, but I never realized what you cured him
            from.

                           JULIE
            He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years.
            The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start
            right in painting...
                 (chuckling)

            That boy looked like pluperfect hell.

ALICE's gaze goes from the nightmare paintings to the MONKEYBONE strips
tacked up over the drafting table.

                           ALICE
            How do you get from here - to there?

                           JULIE
            Switch hands.

                           ALICE
            What?

                           JULIE
            I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction -
            right brain and left brain out of balance. He
            was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil
            to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.

A smile comes to JULIE's face. She settles in on the floor beside ALICE
and digs through the various portfolios until she comes up with a
quickie CARTOON on the back of a napkin - the prototype for...

                           ALICE
            Monkeybone?

                           JULIE
            Left-handed, he was funny. He'd been doing all
            this scary, intense work...then he found out he
            could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he
            liked that.
                 (shrugging)
            And then the nightmares just...stopped.

                           ALICE
            Wow - two guys in the same brain. - Which one
            did you fall in love with?

JULIE smiles at the cartoon. She isn't telling.

                           JULIE
            I've put a ton of work into that boy, Alice. I
            am not going to let him get away from me.

INT. ICU - MORNING

JULIE, in her white lab coat, wanders through Intensive Care and finds a
WOMAN hunched over STU's bed, BAWLING HER EYES OUT.

                           JULIE
            Kimmy...?

KIMMY looks up. She's crying so much she can barely recognize JULIE.

                           KIMMY
            Oh, Julie...my poor Stu...my poor baby
            brother...

                           JULIE
            When'd you get in?

                           KIMMY
            An hour ago.
                 (gathering herself)
            I tried to prepare myself, but I didn't know he
            would be like, like this. I can't even bear to
            look at him... How about you? You're okay?

                           JULIE
            I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.

                           KIMMY
            I had so much I always wanted to say to him. At
            least he had a chance to give you the ring.

                           JULIE
            The ring...

                           KIMMY
            Grandmama's ring. The engagement ring. He asked
            me to send it to him -

JULIE turns to look at STU in the bed. The certain knowledge that he was
about to propose is like a knife in her heart. KIMMY feels bad as well,
having let the cat out of the bag, but before they can hash it out -

                           VOICE FROM BEHIND
            Mrs. Brewster? Julie? I'm Dr. Edelstein.

Cheery DR. EDELSTEIN enters. He shakes hands with the women, then checks
STU's readouts, making notations on his clipboard.

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            Vital signs have stabilized. That's good.

                           KIMMY
            Can you give us a realistic sense of my
            brother's chances?

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            He's held on this far. We can't do much but wait
            and see.

                           KIMMY
            But these...machines are what's keeping him
            alive, is that right?

This remark sends a shiver down JULIE's spine, but she keeps silent.

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            At the moment, yes.

                           KIMMY
            Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long
            this is going to last?

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today,
            tomorrow, a month from now...

                           KIMMY
            Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr.
            Edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of
            doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -

                           JULIE
            Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He
            doesn't even know he's in a -

                           KIMMY
            Please, Julie. This is not easy for me. Our
            father took a long time to die. A long time. It
            just about killed us all. And Stu and I made a
            pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let
            it drag out.

                           JULIE
            It's too soon even to - talk about that!

                           KIMMY
            Give me a date, Doctor.

                           DR. EDELSTEIN
            Three months.
                 (pause)

            There's always some brain damage. But at three
            months...the chances of coming back shrink
            dramatically with every day.

                           KIMMY
            I want him to have every chance, Doctor. We can
            certainly give it...three months.

No one says anything. But both women look at STU, and then at each
other, and everyone knows exactly where everyone else stands. JULIE has
a sinking feeling that STU is working on a 3-month deadline.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN

A beauty pageant - shapely INGENUES in EVENING GOWNS being introduced by
an EMCEE with enormous teeth.

                           EMCEE
            And now the last of our five finalists...Miss
            Michigan...GEORGE T. WILLOUGHBY!

GEORGE is a pudgy shmoe with a small pencil mustache who's wearing
glasses, a necktie, and NOTHING ELSE. He steps forward, holding a
briefcase in front of his crotch, looking EXTREMELY MORTIFIED.

                           EMCEE
            And now George will give us his analysis of
            Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle as it
            pertains to third-world economics!!

CAMERA PULLS BACK - and we realize we're in:

INT. COMA BAR - NIGHT

where BULL the BARTENDER and a number of PATRONS are watching GEORGE's
nightmare on the TV mounted over the bar.

Onscreen, NUDE GEORGE is sweating bullets. He has no idea what to say,
and the audience is beginning to laugh at him. In a desperate, feeble
attempt to buy time...he begins to SING.

                           GEORGE
            I'm gonna wash that man right outta my hair!

In fact he goes into a little softshoe, keeping the briefcase poised
over his crotch. Unfortunately, THE CASE POPS OPEN, dumping frilly
LINGERIE all over the stage. The weeping GEORGE must crawl around on all
fours to retrieve it...

By now the onlookers at the bar are CRACKING UP. All except one - the
lonely, disconsolate fellow on the last stool, nursing a martini - STU.

                           BULL
            Hey, Stu, why so glum? Everybody loves a good
            humiliation nightmare.

                           STU
            Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three
            months since the accident - and I'm no closer to
            going home than I was then.

                           BULL
            Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.

                           STU
            I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting,
            and the carnival rides, and watching people's
            nightmares. And of course, I need not add -

He GRIMACES at MONKEYBONE, who's stretched out atop the mighty Wurlitzer
at the other end of the room. The MERMAID CHANTEUSE is singing a
Dietrich number, "The Laziest Gal in Town" - or at least trying to,
because MONKEYBONE is caterwauling behind her. By the time she gets to
the grand finale, he's practically BAYING AT THE MOON.

Pissed off, she SHAKES her FIST at MONKEYBONE and pulls the lid of her
clamshell SHUT. This suits MONKEYBONE just fine, as it leaves him alone
in the spotlight to soak up what little applause there is.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Thank you, thank you for that very modest

            response. I know you're all in comas, but still.
            And now...it's dedication time!

He gestures to JUMBO, the elephant organist, who begins to vamp.

                           MONKEYBONE
            We've got a special dedication tonight. This
            one's from my ever-lovin' boss, Mr. Stu Mopey -
            I mean Miley - and we're sendin' it up to
            a very special lady in the land of the living.
            Yes, I do mean Julie - the beautiful Miss Julie
            - who, if she has a brain in her head, is
            shacked up right now with some good-lookin' doc
            she met in the E.R.!
                 (pointing at STU)
            JUST KIDDING, BUDDY! Because if we know anything
            about Miss Julie, we know she is faithful,
            loyal, and true. Even if her boyfriend is an
            eggplant. Which is why we're dedicating...this
            very special tune...to her. Jumbo?

JUMBO's tasteful vamping gives way to a RAUNCHY ROCK BEAT - and
MONKEYBONE begins STRUTTING across the top of the piano, bumping and
grinding and shaking his booty to the tune of -

                           MONKEYBONE
            MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!
            MAH baby does the Hanky-Panky! UNHH!

MONKEYBONE sings the same poignant line over and over until STU comes
storming over from the bar and YANKS HIM off the Wurlitzer by the scruff
of his scrawny NECK.

A trouper to the end, MONKEYBONE WAVES at the crowd even as STU drags
him off to an empty table in the farthest corner of the room.

                           STU
            You have humiliated me in public for the last

            time.

                           MONKEYBONE
            I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm
            just a figment of your imagination.

                           STU
            Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a
            masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me.

                           STU
            I am not. And I don't gotta.

MONKEYBONE waves and winks at every female who passes by. STU whacks him
upside the head.

                           MONKEYBONE
            You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could
            both be gettin' some o' this fine local action.
            It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town,
            under five minutes, and in a coma don't count.

                           STU
            Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of
            them aren't even my species.

Cocktail waitress KITTY, a seven-foot cat-faced feline sex bomb, arrives
in her skimpy black dress and shows STU a Cheshire-cat grin. MONKEYBONE
reclines, Odalisque-style, on the table.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Hellooooooooo, Kitty.

                           KITTY
            Hiya, Stu. Refill on that martini?

                           MONKEYBONE
            I'd like something with an umbrella in it and a
            really smutty name. Like a...Sex Behind the Sofa
            with Your Parents in the Same Room Watching "The
            Brady Bunch."

                           STU
            Nothing for him! He's being repressed.

                           KITTY
            Is something wrong, Stu? You seem so tense.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just
            wishin' he was me.

                           STU
            I've been trying to get through to the head guy
            - the nightmare god - what's his name?

                           KITTY
            Hypnos?

                           STU
            Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I
            wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think
            I'll never see her again.

A softie at heart, KITTY sits across from STU and takes his hand.

                           STU
            I shoulda proposed, Kitty. That way at least
            she'd know how I feel. That way she'd...wait for
            me.

She leans forward sympathetically. From this particular vantage,
MONKEYBONE has an unobstructed view of KITTY's cleavage. And so does STU
- although he's not quite as obvious about staring.

                           KITTY
            She is waiting for you, Stu. I know she is. Guys
            like you don't come along that often. Believe
            me, I know.

MONKEYBONE slinks over behind STU - up onto his shoulder - and whispers
into his ear:

                           MONKEYBONE
            My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us
            boldly go where no man has gone before.

                           STU
                 (trying to ignore him)

            I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?

                           KITTY
            I mean it, Stu. You're one in a million.

KITTY is holding the cleavage pose for an unnaturally long time. Her
furry tail begins to swing back and forth playfully in the air. It's
hypnotic - like a windshield wiper.

STU stares at it. MONKEYBONE stares at it. And MONKEYBONE'S TAIL
responds by straightening...stiffening...bending upward slightly.

                           STU
            I'm not so special. I'm just - kind of -

STU is suddenly aware of something LONG, RED, and WET unrolling onto his
shoulder. It's a TONGUE...dangling out of MONKEYBONE'S OPEN MOUTH. STU
lets out a YOWL OF SHOCK.

Blushing bright red, he GRABS THE TONGUE and shoves it manually back
into the monkey mouth whence it came.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done
            the same if you had the equipment!

                           STU
            THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!

                           MONKEYBONE
            FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -

STU LUNGES at MONKEYBONE - who JUMPS OVER HIM, BOUNDS off the edge of
the table, and grabs hold of a CHANDELIER.

                           MONKEYBONE
            I'm reportin' this to my union!!

                           STU
            What union?

                           MONKEYBONE
            The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the
            Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your
            ass!

STU grabs a CHAIR and swings it at the chandelier. MONKEYBONE makes a
series of SUBMARINE NOISES -

                           MONKEYBONE
            DIVE! DIVE!!

- and DIVES - directly between KITTY's breasts into her skimpy black
dress!! STU circles around KITTY, following the undulating monkey-sized
BLOB that's tunnelling around under her dress. Finally MONKEYBONE pops
out of the BACK of the dress and NUZZLES KITTY'S EAR:

                           MONKEYBONE
            I left my phone number in your undies. Try not
            to lose it in traffic.

                           STU
            Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke
            my monkey.

MONKEYBONE runs under the pool table. STU is giving chase when -
suddenly - a DOOR blows open in the chill night wind.

EVERYONE IN THE BAR freezes in place.

For there, in the doorway, is a looming, ominous figure - the most
dreaded figure in all of Dark Town -

- a GRIM REAPER, nine feet tall and swinging a scythe, come to take some
hapless coma victim to the land of Death!

EERIE WINDS WHISTLE and the shroud FLUTTERS in the night breeze as the
REAPER looks from face to face. For a moment he focuses on STU. STU
backs away involuntarily, with a mounting sense of dread...and
MONKEYBONE jumps into his arms, clinging to him fearfully.

But the REAPER moves on - past each COMA VICTIM in turn - finally
STOPPING in front of a TINY, WIZENED, PRUNELIKE OLD GENT in a
wheelchair, who looks to be 110 years old at least.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Him. Whew. About time!

                           REAPER
            EARL BIEGLER. I'VE COME -

                           EARL
            Can't hear you, young fellow. Speak up!

                           REAPER
            EARL BIEGLER, I'VE COME TO GIVE YOU - aw, hell.
            Here.

GASPS OF ANTICIPATION all around the room as the REAPER hands EARL a
long white ENVELOPE. EARL opens it slowly and removes...

...an oversized rectangular TICKET...the size of a Hershey bar, made of
SOLID GOLD, with the letter "E" stamped upon it.

VARIOUS CHARACTERS around the barroom react, in hushed voices:

                           BULL
            An E-Ticket!

                           PATRON
            He got a reprieve.

                           KITTY
            Good for him! He's gonna wake up!

EARL throws his crutches aside, jumps out of his chair, and DANCES A
JIG, waving the ticket over his head. STU stares at him with naked envy.

                           STU
            No. No. Not him.

                           EARL
            So long, suckers! See you in the funny papers!

EARL does an end-zone dance toward the door. One by one, OTHER PATRONS
get up from their seats to watch EARL's departure.


EXT. COMA BAR - STREETS - NIGHT

The COMA VICTIMS shuffle toward a BIG RIDE across the midway.

It's a "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine - the kind where you slam down a
mallet and try to ring the bell. It's surrounded by crocodile moats and
storm fences and electrified barbed wire, and a big sign reading PRIVATE
- NO ADMITTANCE.

EARL, still jubilant, inserts his E-ticket into a receptacle at the
entrance. A DRAWBRIDGE LOWERS, and CAROUSEL MUSIC cranks up, and
CARNIVAL LIGHTS blink on, and FIREWORKS rocket into the sky...

All around them, faces turn skyward. CLOUDS are parting. An EDDY of
swirling colors is forming DIRECTLY ABOVE the E-ticket ride - and a
PINPOINT HOLE opens up at its center.

The "TEST YOUR STRENGTH" machine has been outfitted with a SEAT where
the bell-ringer should be. Once EARL has settled in, a GIANT MECHANICAL
MAN lifts its enormous mallet...

...and SLAMS IT DOWN on the lever end of the machine, sending EARL
ROCKETING UPWARD toward the hole in the sky. DING!! The SEAT hits the
BELL, but EARL keeps going - up - up - UP...

Then, with a distinct POP, he's gone. Over the rainbow...home.

                           STU
            He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How
            come he goes back and I stay here?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?

                           STU
                 (turning abruptly)
            HEY!! HEY, YOU!!

STU marches across the street to the GRIM REAPER - who's climbing onto
his WINGED BICYCLE and seems shocked that anyone would want to chat with
him. MONKEYBONE scurries alongside, terrified.

                           STU
            He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get

            to wake up??

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.

                           STU
            I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody
            had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna
            - I'm gonna kick ass!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.

MONKEYBONE practically swoons. But the REAPER just stares at STU:

                           REAPER
            SORRY, BUD. OFF-DUTY.

The REAPER climbs onto his winged bike and PEDALS OFF down the midway.
STU lets out a HOWL OF FRUSTRATION.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu? Stu? Let's calm down, talk things over. How
            about some comedy relief? Okay. Brontosaurus
            walks into a gay bar...

STU BOOTS MONKEYBONE aside. They're at a GAME STALL manned by Elsie the
Cow - the one where you throw baseballs at milk bottles. STU picks up a
baseball and HURLS IT at the departing REAPER.

The ball hits the REAPER smack on the head, knocking him off his bike!

                           STU/MONKEYBONE
                 (in unison - impressed)
            Damn.

MONKEYBONE cowers in fear as the REAPER gets up, shaking a fist at them.
But STU isn't intimidated. He grabs another ball and winds up.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu? Stu? I think weve got this backwards. Your
            behavior...is disturbing me.

The REAPER, scared shitless, jumps back on his bike and PEDALS OFF as
the ball whizzes past. STU starts chasing after him!

The REAPER turns down a side street and pedals up an incline - one of
the "fingers" of the hand that holds Dark Town. When the bike hits the
end of the finger, it TAKES OFF into the void and KEEPS ON GOING.

                           STU
            That's right. Run! And don't come back unless
            you've got my e-ticket!!

The REAPER vanishes. STU sits dejectedly on the edge of the curb.

                           STU
            Who am I kidding? I'm never gonna get out of
            here. I'll never see her again.

Just then, a multi-armed MESSENGER BOY in royal livery toodles past on a
CHILD'S SCOOTER. He stops...

                           MESSENGER BOY
            Miley? Stu Miley?

STU looks up. Six arms reach into six pockets. Finally the MESSENGER
finds an ENVELOPE and hands it over. Inside is an ENGRAVED INVITATION:

                          YOU Are Invited to a
                              PAJAMA PARTY
                          at HYPNOS' HIDEAWAY
                     Penthouse Suite - 10 PM Sharp
                       "If You Snooze, You Lose"

STU'S EYES widen with excitement as the MESSENGER scoots off.

                           STU
            Hypnos! The god of nightmares! Do you know what
            this means, Monkeybone? He's finally going to
            hear my case. I'm going home!

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - MORNING

As she's done every morning for the last three months, JULIE brushes
STU'S TEETH. Although she looks a bit more worn and haggard than when we
saw her last, she always affects a cheerful manner around STU - on the
off chance that he might be aware of her presence.

She packs the toothbrush away, runs a hand along his stubbly cheek.

                           JULIE
            I think we can go another day without shaving.
            Long as you don't look like you're growing one
            of those stupid little goatees.

She opens up the entertainment section of the daily newspaper.

                           JULIE
            Hey, there's an article about the Monkeybone
            show. They've run that one episode about eight
            times now. Herb says it gets higher ratings
            every time...they're hoping you'll give 'em some
            new material soon...
                 (long, bored pause)
            Wanna hear another joke?

She refolds the paper and reaches into a bedside drawer for a paperback
entitled The Book of Raunch. She pages through it for a moment.

                           JULIE
            Okay...let me see...here we go. A plane full of
            explorers crashlands in New Guinea; they are
            captured by a cannibal tribe and taken to the
            chief's hut, where...wait a minute. I know this
            one...
                 (reading ahead)

            You stinker! You swiped this joke for a
            Monkeybone strip!

She whacks him on the arm with the book. No response at all.

                           JULIE
            Okay. Let's try again. Why did the pervert cross
            the road?

The sound of SOBBING interrupts her joke. She looks up and sees KIMMY
standing in the doorway, red-eyed and crying.

                           JULIE
            Kimmy! What's the matter?

                           KIMMY
            This is hard for me, Julie...very hard...but
            it's been three months now, and...
                 (long pause)
            I gave the order.

JULIE just stares at her for a beat or two, refusing to understand. Then
it sinks in. Her hand goes to her mouth in horror and grief.

                                            FADE THROUGH TO:

EXT. HYPNOSPIRE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS up the seemingly endless length of the HYPNOSPIRE - up,
up, THROUGH a heavy layer of clouds, to the ROTATING PENTHOUSE DOME of
the building...

...which is festooned with oodles of 18-INCH DSS SATELLITE DISHES.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - NIGHT

ELEVATOR DOORS open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space-age
bachelor pad of HYPNOS, God of Sleep. A giant flying CUPID welcomes us,
tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft.

HYP'S HIDEAWAY occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a
party in full effect. A rotating disco ball flashes colored light on
walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic OP-ART PATTERNS.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Now this...is livin'.

Of course, a party needs party animals - and the DARKTOWNERS on the
scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. DJ
SLEEPY ZZZ'S has three turntables spinning at once.

As STU wanders through, he gets a big surprise. Reproductions of his old
NIGHTMARE PAINTINGS are hanging on the walls! They've been turned into
ONE-SHEETS for the coming attractions at the Morpheum.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can
            paint better than that.

                           STU
            Like you'd know. You started out on the back of
            a napkin, you little...doodle.

Scowling at each other, the boys turn their backs and part ways. We
follow MONKEYBONE to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into
a statuesque GORGON with a full head of writhing SNAKES.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Hey! Like the do. So tell me, are you a, uhh...
            natural snakehead?

                           GORGON
            Only fifty dollars to find out.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Fifty dollars?! Bite me!

                           GORGON
            You got it, big boy.

He grins and shrugs: what the hell. As they head for a back room, the
BARTENDER hands him a SNAKEBITE KIT.

A look of apprehension crosses MONKEYBONE's face. But before he can
change his mind, the GORGON'S HAND yanks him out of frame.

STU, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering
animal-people who DANCE in their bizarre, uninhibited way. A FIVE-LEGGED
WOMAN - the bottom half of her body a big human HAND - SMILES at STU as
he passes. He tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five
constantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close.

                           STU
            Say, have you seen Mr. Hypnos?

                           HAND WOMAN
            Hyp? He was here a while ago. Aren't you Stu
            Miley? The nightmare guy?

STU grins meekly, nods yes. She pulls him over to dance.

                           HAND WOMAN
            I heard you were going to be here tonight. This
            is so cool!

JUMBO the ELEPHANT GOD is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby. His trunk
swings out and hits one of the HAND WOMAN'S arms - which SNAPS OFF like
marble statuary. Before she can let out a squeal, he does it again. Now
she's armless - a regular Venus de Milo!

                           HAND WOMAN
            You fat slob! Watch what you're doing!

                           JUMBO
            Why don't you slap me? Go on, slap me!

                           HAND WOMAN
            Come on, Stu. Let's go where the real fun is.

She leads him over to the sunken living room. Among the other guests, we
see a CYCLOPS, a YETI, a BBQ PIG. A number of sofas and lounge chairs
are arranged around a big crystal ORB in the center of the room.

The ORB is where nightmares happen. Although the perspective shifts and
the locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a
3-D quality - as if they're taking place right here in the room with us!

                           STU
            Wow. Live feed, huh?

                           HAND WOMAN
            You bet. Hyp gets all the best stuff before it
            goes out to the theatres.

STU grins in anticipation. He finds an empty chair and starts to sit
down - but there's a SLUG with a MAN'S HEAD already in it!

                           SLUG WITH A MAN'S HEAD
            HEY!

                           STU
            Sorry.

STU picks another seat. The HAND WOMAN sidles up alongside him.

                           HAND WOMAN
            Shh! There's a new one just starting.


EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB)

In long shot we see a handsome young couple dressed in paisley prints.
Emerging from a sylvan glade, they kiss in golden sunlight. Then the MAN
breaks free - sprints through knee-high sunflowers to the middle of the
field, where a picnic blanket is waiting.

CLOSEUP - STU

HIS FACE GOES PALE as he recognizes the man in the paisley shirt.

                           STU
            That - that's me.

                           CYCLOPS
            Nice shirt, dude!

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

Paisley-shirted STU pours champagne for two. Toasts his beloved - who
is, of course, JULIE, the dreamer of the dream.

He pulls out a little velvet RING BOX and offers it to her. But when she
tries to take it, he pulls it away, teasing her, and STEALS A KISS.

Suddenly the two of them are locked in a tight embrace, rolling together
through the flowers, LAUGHING, full of joy.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS are rubbing their hands together in anticipation of
horrors to come. STU looks from one misshapen face to the next, his
heart pounding with dread.

                           STU
            What is this? Who's dreaming this??
                 (beat)
            Julie??

                           YETI
            Hey, keep it down!

EXT. FIELD OF FLOWERS (NIGHTMARE ORB) - DAY

JULIE rolls onto her back on the grass, FACE AGLOW. Only to realize...
that STU IS NO LONGER THERE BESIDE HER.

She looks around. Gets to her feet. Turns. And the BACKGROUND behind her
MORPHS suddenly into...

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

The room is decorated for a FAREWELL PARTY, complete with streamers and
confetti. KIMMY, DR. EDELSTEIN, various MEDICAL PERSONNEL and FRIENDS
are wearing party hats, lifting champagne glasses in a toast to the
guest of honor...the comatose Stu!

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

The DARKTOWNERS clustered around the orb can barely conceal their animal
excitement. It's obvious that the nightmares they're watching are more
than mere entertainment - they get some kind of addictive, visceral
charge from the spectacle of human terror.

                           STU
            JULIE!!

He tries to push his way forward to the orb. An angry CYCLOPS elbows him
aside. A YETI grabs his coat and pushes him out of the way.

                           HAND WOMAN
            Stu!! What are you doing? Chill out!!

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM (NIGHTMARE ORB)

COMATOSE STU stands in the center of the room, UPRIGHT and IMMOBILE in a
party hat. A weird UMBILICAL CORD extends from his navel to a huge
groaning BELLOWS DEVICE - like an artificial lung, it's all that keeps
him breathing.

EDELSTEIN hands a pair of OVERSIZED CEREMONIAL SCISSORS to KIMMY, and
she CUTS THE CORD, as if opening a new mall. Applause all around. JULIE
races toward STU in slo-mo, SHRIEKING -

- as he DEFLATES into a LIMP PUDDLE OF FLESH before her eyes!!

                           JULIE
            No. No. STU!

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - ON STU

JULIE's distress is killing him. Yet all around him, DARKTOWNERS are
cackling their heads off, growling, howling, punching their fists in the
air like rowdy drunks at a football game. He LOSES IT ALTOGETHER.

                           STU
            JULIE! I'M HERE, DOC! DON'T LET THEM PULL THE
            PLUG! I'M HERE!!!

He won't be stopped this time. He makes for the orb - climbing over
sofas, pushing guests aside, knocking over their drinks -

                           CYCLOPS
            HEY! Watch it, you stinkin' gringo -

                           STU
            JULIE! I'M HERE! I LOVE YOU!

Somehow, JULIE has heard him!! Down in the nightmare orb, her dream self
is looking UP, trying to locate the source of STU's disembodied voice!
He struggles to reach the orb, but the CYCLOPS is holding him back.

                           JULIE
            Stu? STU...?

STU breaks free and FLINGS HIMSELF on the ORB - which SHORTS OUT in a
haze of smoke and sparks, abruptly ending the nightmare. JULIE's image
vanishes - and STU gropes at the air, DESPAIRING.

INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT

The real JULIE awakens suddenly and lets out a scream of her own.

                           JULIE
            STU!!!!

Only now does she realize where she is. She's fallen asleep in the
visitor's chair next to STU's bed. The clock on the wall reads 1:15 AM.

STU'S READOUTS are spiking like crazy.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

STU is being dragged across the dance floor by the YETI and JUMBO THE
ELEPHANT GOD. HAND WOMAN brings up the rear.

                           JUMBO
            Who invited this schmuck, anyway?

                           HAND WOMAN
            Oh, it's my fault. I thought he was cooler than
            that.

                           STU
            Listen. Please. It's my girlfriend. I've gotta
            get a message to her...

But just then a hush falls over the room, and someone screams...

                           WOMAN'S VOICE
            HYP!!!

A WALL PANEL does a 180-degree turn, and a CIRCULAR BED rotates into the
room. Languishing atop it, garbed in a silk robe which exactly matches
the black & white checkerboard pattern of the bedspread...

...is a CHUBBY, GRINNING, SLEEPY-EYED SATYR, with horns and hooves. TWO
WASP WOMEN are with him on the bed, brushing his furry goat legs and
feeding him grapes.

As STU fights his way over, he sees an odd LUMP wriggling under the
bedcovers. Out pops MONKEYBONE, clutching a bottle of champagne!

                           MONKEYBONE
            I knew I left it in there somewhere.

He shakes the bottle, pops the cork, and SPRAYS SPURTING BUBBLY at
HYPNOS, the GIRLS, and everyone else within firing range!

                           HYPNOS
            Haw! I like a monkey with vision!

                           MONKEYBONE
            You said it, partner!

Hilarity all around. STU snatches MONKEYBONE off the bed -

                           STU
            How'd you get in there?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu... It's a party.

                           STU
            Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -

                           HYPNOS
            Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls
            ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house!
                 (leading a round of applause)

            This is an honor. We see a lot of nightmares
            down here, but yours are like caviar, man. You
            da shits!!

                           STU
            Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was
            having it. She dreamed they were pulling the
            plug on me. She was watching me die.

                           HYPNOS
            Uh huh. And?

                           STU
            Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to
            let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of
            here...

A vaguely embarrassed look crosses HYPNOS's face. All the nearby
DARKTOWNERS stare at their shoes, clear their throats.

                           STU
            ...which is actually what I wanted to talk to
            you about. See, I've been here three months -

With a brusque gesture, HYPNOS sends the party girls packing. He slings
one arm around STU's shoulder and pulls him aside.

                           HYPNOS
            Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?

                           STU
            Tell me what?

                           HYPNOS
            It's a special kind of party. A farewell party.
            Do you...get what I'm saying?

                           STU
            Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -

STU EXPLODES WITH JOY. He practically dances a jig.

                           STU
            I'M GOING HOME! I'M WAKING UP! HEY, EVERYBODY!
            I'M OUTTA HERE. I...

One by one, the celebrants turn their backs and slink discreetly away.

                           STU
            I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or
            don't I get to... Is there some...

                           HYPNOS
            Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this
            pact with your sister...no life support?

MONKEYBONE's jaw drops. He slaps himself across the forehead.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??

                           STU
            Well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. It was
            different then. I was depressed. My life is
            great now. I'm in love!

MONKEYBONE marches back and forth across the bed, wearing a dimwit's
expression as he MOCKS STU in a singsongy voice...

                           MONKEYBONE
            Pull the plug! Pull the plug! Take my organs! I
            don't need 'em! I don't need no! Life support!
            I'm an idiot! Pull the pl--

STU grabs the monkey and clamps a hand over his mouth.

                           STU
            Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...

                           HYPNOS
            Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide.
            That's why she was having the nightmare.
                 (an embarrassed shrug)

            They're pulling the plug at nine AM.

                           STU
            Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours.

In checking his watch, STU removes his hand from MONKEYBONE's mouth. The
singsong resumes...

                           MONKEYBONE
            I'm so dumb! I deserve to die -

                           STU
            Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you.
            There's gotta be something I can do.

                           HYPNOS
            Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work,
            but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's
            bailiwick.

                           STU
            Maybe you could talk to Death!

                           HYPNOS
            Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will
            be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before
            I go crawling to that piece of -

HYP shuts up. Looks around the room, as if he's afraid of being
overheard. Then he gestures to the boys to join him on the bed.

They climb aboard eagerly. HYPNOS hits his remote...

INT. HYPNOS'S BEDROOM - ON BED

...and they rotate AWAY from the party. Privacy at last.

                           HYPNOS
            Now Death is not what you would call a people
            person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should
            know. I'm his little brother.

                           STU
            You're Death's brother?

                           HYPNOS
            Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My-
            Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the
            course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired
            of that schtick.
                 (spreading his hands)

            So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down
            amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it.
            I'm supposed to be grateful?

                           MONKEYBONE
            The penthouse is pretty swank, though.

                           HYPNOS
            Thank you. I decorated it myself.

                           STU
            Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have
            eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...

                           HYPNOS
            Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you
            might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled
            it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there
            was that other guy who...well, very few people
            have done it.

                           STU
            Hyp, I'll do anything.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Me too. And I mean anything. Ask the chicks in
            the back room.

                           HYPNOS
            You've seen those E-tickets, right? Well, what
            you gotta do...is go into the Land of Death...
            and steal an E-ticket right out from under
            Death's nose.

                           STU
            Land of Death. How do I get there?

                           HYPNOS
            Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you
            didn't hear it from me.

HYP hits the remote. The bed begins to ROTATE OUTWARD again.

                           HYPNOS
            You've heard of a fate worse than Death? That's
            what's waiting for you if you screw up.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - A MOMENT LATER

HYP gives the boys a wink and a thumbs-up, then wanders off to shmooze
his other guests. MONKEYBONE shakes STU's hand.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real,
            boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY
            HERE NEED A FIGMENT?

                           STU
            Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the
            land of Death alone.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu, you have my absolute confidence. ­- DEAD
            MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!

                           STU
                 (grabbing him by the throat)
            I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and
            I'm gonna take it - with or without you.

He turns and stalks off. MONKEYBONE stands there blinking.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?

                           STU
            No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.

Stunned, MONKEYBONE scurries along behind him, PLEADING.

                           MONKEYBONE
            You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on
            your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick.
            For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter -
                 (wrapping himself around STU's leg)
            It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death!
            Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!

                           STU
            All right. You can come.

                           MONKEYBONE
            OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH--
                 (suddenly realizing)
            Something went very, very wrong here.

                           STU
            Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.

As if in reply, a PALE, SPECTRAL PRESENCE comes drifting across the
dance floor - an eight-foot-tall GRIM REAPER.

The boys duck behind a POTTED PLANT to watch as he zeroes in on the WET
BAR - where a beautiful coma victim, LULU, is drunkenly making out with
another sloshed corpse-to-be, FRED.

                           REAPER
            LULU LA RUE. I HAVE COME FOR YOU.

LULU doesn't notice. She continues grappling with FRED. Muttering, the
REAPER dives in and tries to disentangle them.

                           REAPER
            LULU LA RUE, I HAVE COME FOR -

                           LULU
            Shay, you're kinda cute.

She ditches FRED and throws her arms around the REAPER. Repulsed, he
pushes her away, props her against the nearest wall -

- and TOUCHES HER with one bony finger above the heart! It's like
throwing a switch. Her body stiffens. Her EYES cross. Her TONGUE droops
out of her mouth. She makes a noise like a DIAL TONE.

The true horror of death is that it makes you look like a total idiot.
The REAPER pulls a collapsible HAND TRUCK from beneath his shroud and
starts maneuvering LULU onto it.

                           FRED
            Say there. How 'bout one for the road?

The REAPER ignores him. FRED holds up a cocktail glass.

                           FRED
            Hold this for me, pally.

The REAPER heaves a sigh and takes the cocktail glass. FRED grabs a
pitcher filled with some luminescent tropical concoction...

...and POURS IT down the REAPER's front!

                           FRED
            Ooopsy daisy.


ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - BEHIND THE PLANT

WINCING at the REAPER in his sopping wet, pink-stained shroud.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Is that what they call "death with dignity"?

The REAPER wrings out his shroud and grabs the hand truck. As he wheels
LULU past the boys, MONKEYBONE pops up with a helpful hint:

                           MONKEYBONE
            Two words for you, my friend: club soda.

STU claps a hand over MB's mouth as the REAPER turns down a hall.

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

The still-muttering REAPER wheels LULU toward the entrance to Dark Town.
The boys are skulking along behind him at a discreet distance.

                           STU
            He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So
            all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride!
                 (beat)
            Stop shaking! I'll protect you.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be
            Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?

The REAPER approaches the GATES. He presses a remote-control BEEPER and
the meshing teeth of the gates slide back far enough to let him pass
through.

STU realizes they've only got an instant to make their move. He DIVES
through the gates at top speed. As soon as he's on the other side, he
hears a nasty CLANG behind him...

MONKEYBONE is caught - his body contorted like a pretzel, woven in and
out among the meshing teeth! STU gives him a good hard YANK, and he
slips out like a strand of fettuccine.

They hear RUMBLING on the tracks outside. A CAR is arriving!

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - OTHER SIDE - NIGHT

The REAPER loads LULU into the little roller-coaster and climbs aboard.
The car begins to move. STU and MONKEYBONE get there just in time to
jump onto the LUGGAGE RACK in the back!

ON ROLLER-COASTER - MOVING - THAT MOMENT

They peep over the back of the car at the REAPER and wonder what to do
next. MONKEYBONE spies a TOOL KIT mounted under the rack - opens it, and
pulls out a big, nasty MONKEYWRENCH.

The boys nod in agreement. MONKEYBONE clambers over the back of the car
and hoists the wrench. STU covers his eyes. WHANG!

STU looks up - sees a confused MONKEYBONE alone in the car with LULU.
Now he clambers into the car as well.

                           STU
            Where'd he go??

                           MONKEYBONE
            I don't know.

There's no trace of the REAPER - except for a rumpled shroud, a
wristwatch, and a St. Christopher's medal on the floor of the car. The
boys exchange a puzzled shrug. MONKEYBONE tries on the watch.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SLEEP LAB - PRE-DAWN

The wall clock says it's not quite 3 AM, yet JULIE has managed to round
up all her co-workers: ALICE, HUTCH, CLARISSA, et al. They're groggy,
disheveled, un-made-up, unshaven. But they're there.

                           JULIE
            Six hours. That's when they pull the plug.
            That's how long we've got to wake him up.
                 (beat)

            Now these are Stu's old charts from five years
            ago, when he first came to the sleep lab...

She points to a series of EASELS where HUTCH and ALICE have been tacking
up EEG printouts, engram maps, etc.

                           JULIE
            ...they show incredibly intense nightmare
            activity. The chart below is his new chart...

The lower chart shows a JAGGED SPIKE virtually identical to the one on
the upper chart. JULIE pauses for effect - then pulls on the edge of the
lower chart, OPENING IT UP like a gatefold -

The onlookers GASP. Opened accordion-style, the lower chart shows the
SAME SPIKE recurring again and again, TEN TIMES OVER!

                           HUTCH
            Holy shit.

                           JULIE
            He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop.
                 (beat)
            Anybody here know what Oneirix is?

                           CLARISSA
            Sure - it's an enzyme. The brain secretes it
            during violent dream activity...

                           HUTCH
            It's nightmare juice. Julie and I were on the
            team that learned to synthesize it. If those
            charts are right, Stu's swimming in the stuff.
                 (puzzled)
            Are you thinking we can decrease the levels?

                           JULIE
            No. I want to give him more. I want to give him
            a massive dose.

                           HUTCH
            That's not going to stop his nightmare -

                        JULIE
            I don't want to stop the nightmare, Hutch. I
            want to crank it up. I want to take it right off
            the charts. I want to scare him awake.

The group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky. JULIE claps her hands:

                           JULIE
            All right! We have a plan. Let's move!

As the group swings into action, HUTCH pulls JULIE aside.

                           HUTCH
            You know, Julie, even if this works - which it
            probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't
            know what it'll do to his brain.

                           JULIE
            What'll it do if they pull the plug?

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LAND OF DEATH - NIGHT

A PANORAMIC VIEW of an impossibly grand, Gilded-Age TRAIN STATION. A
central turntable is the hub for dozens of TUNNELS, which converge like
the spokes of a wheel, disgorging long trains full of DEAD PASSENGERS
from all over the world.

Far above, in the dizzying reaches of the vaulted DOME that crowns the
station, REAPERS on FLYING BICYCLES spiral about like mosquitos,
bringing dead souls to their final reward.

This is Thanatopolis - land of Death - truly the end of the line.

A WET SQUEEGEE scrapes across the frame - wielded by a GRIM REAPER in a
jumpsuit bearing the logo of "LAND OF DEATH WINDOW WASHERS, INC." The
noise is irritating, so a REAPER on the inside snaps the venetian blinds
shut, cutting off our view.

CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we realize we've been seeing all this through the
wall-to-wall windows of...

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

It looks like the observation bridge in the nose of the Nautilus; the
decor is ornate, and the office equipment - vacuum tubes, pipe
intercoms, etc. - is on loan from the Jules Verne Museum of Defunct
Technology.

REAPERS are bustling about everywhere. One of them pushing a HAND TRUCK
laden with oversized crates bearing the label "DEAD SOULS."

                           REAPER
            Batch of souls - just back from Processing.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            Put them over there with the others.

He unloads the crates in a corner of the room, where SCORES of crated
souls are already piled up.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            Your Grimness? We have a new shipment -

                           DEATH (o.s.)
            Yeah, yeah, yeah... I'll get to it...

We can't see DEATH himself - just the back of a tall swivel chair. With
much creaking, it rotates around - bringing us face-to-face with...

CLOSEUP - DEATH

He's not at all what you'd expect. He's a chubby-cheeked, bespectacled
ACCOUNTANT TYPE...a harried bureaucrat, just trying to do his job.
There's something sweet, almost avuncular about him.

There's an open crate of DEAD SOULS on his desk. Dead souls take the
form of PERFORATED PAPER DOLLS...two-dimensional, underwear-clad,
usually wearing expressions of shock. DEATH pulls a sheet from the box,
detaches the dead soul, and outfits it with a cut-out TOGA.

Now he places it in a big diorama - with OODLES of toga-clad souls
staring up at a scale model of an active volcano. He throws a switch and
BEAMS as the volcano spits BLOBS OF KETCHUP into the air.

                           DEATH
            Last Days of Pompeii...now there was a Great
            Moment in Death.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            If I may point out...it is 12:05...

DEATH, grumbling, digs into the box and pulls out another soul. His eyes
light up. He clutches the sheet with trembling hands.

                           DEATH
            I can't believe - oh, man, I - SINATRA!! Do you
            know how long I've been waiting for this?

Sure enough, the doll on the sheet is Ol' Blue Eyes. DEATH digs in a
desk drawer and pulls out a SHOEBOX DIORAMA...DINO and SAMMY standing at
microphones, with a third, center mike conspicuously open.

                           DEATH'S ASSISTANT
            Make that 12:07, your bleakness...the dispatch
            team is waiting...

Grumpy, DEATH shoves FRANK, DEAN, and SAMMY back in the drawer.

                           DEATH
            Okay, okay, send 'em in. Jeez.


INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS - DAY

A FLUNKY opens the office door, and a long line of REAPERS glides in.
DEATH lugs an enormous musty leather-bound BOOK over to a long table. He
snaps his fingers and WHISTLES.

His pet HELLHOUND - a tiny plump weiner dog, with a HORNED DEATH'S HEAD
for a face, comes skittering across the office floor and jumps into his
lap. Meanwhile, the ASSISTANT turns on a chugging, card-shuffling UNIVAC
COMPUTER, which spits out a length of TICKERTAPE.

                           ASSISTANT
            Chakasandra Singh, New Delhi. Snakebite.

DEATH checks the name against the master list in his big ledger. He
pulls out a document and puts his STAMP on it - the DEATH WARRANT. This
he gives to the REAPER at the head of the line.

                           ASSISTANT
            Mulrooney, Lavinia P., Dearborn, Michigan. Head
            crushed in a pants press.

As the line moves along, we notice an odd-looking REAPER nearing the
desk. His gait is wobbly. His head bobs independently of the rest of his
body. There's a big, luminescent STAIN on the front of his shroud.

                           DEATH
            YOU!!!

EVERYONE FREEZES as DEATH points a bony finger DIRECTLY AT the wobbly
REAPER with the iridescent stain.

                           DEATH
            You're the customer, okay? You're about to die.
            It's a big occasion. A formal occasion. And as
            you shuffle off this mortal coil, the last thing
            your eyes behold is a Grim Reaper covered
            with...
                 (sputtering)
            What the hell is that??

TWO VOICES come out from under the shroud at once:

            STU                                 MONKEYBONE
   Cranberry Margarita.                Sex on the Beach.

Much COUGHING and THROAT-CLEARING from under the shroud. By now DEATH'S
LAPDOG is GROWLING at the STAINED REAPER, and DEATH can't hear what
anyone is saying. He shushes the dog.

                           DEATH
            ...What??

            STU                                 MONKEYBONE
   Salty Dog.                          Sufferin' Bastard.

The little hellhound YIPS VICIOUSLY. DEATH whacks him on the rump.

                           DEATH
            Well - whatever it is - you get that shroud to
            the dry cleaner ASAP! Now where were we?

                           ASSISTANT
            Clarke P. Devereaux, San Francisco.
            Complications resulting from coma...

                           DEATH
            Oh, wait. Says here he's supposed to recover.

A loud chorus of "A WWWWW's" from the disappointed REAPERS. DEATH stamps
the word "REPRIEVE" on Clarke's warrant.

His ASSISTANT crosses the room. In the far wall is a steel-reinforced
VAULT DOOR with a hydraulic wheel - the kind you see at banks. The
ASSISTANT dials in a combination, turns the wheel, laboriously pulls the
door open and STEPS INSIDE...

...returning, a moment later, with a priceless gold E-TICKET!!

The UPPER HALF of the STAINED REAPER begins to gyrate wildly.

CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER THE SHROUD

MONKEYBONE is doing an agitated TAP DANCE on his head. His TAIL whips
repeatedly across STU'S FACE.


INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE

The REAPER in front of the boys stares at the E-ticket, crestfallen.

                           DEATH
            Take this to Dark Town. Sad to say, he's gonna
            live another forty years.
                 (a consoling pat on the shoulder)
            Sorry. Nobody said this job would be easy.

The ASSISTANT hands the REAPER a YELLOW MAILMAN'S POUCH containing the
E-ticket. But before he can depart, the STAINED REAPER - aka STU and
MONKEYBONE - jumps to the front of the line.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Say, Death, just out of curiosity, could we
            maybe swap jobs with that other guy? See, we've
            been meaning to drop in on Dark Town - I mean
            I've been meaning to...

DEATH is stunned by this unprecedented breach of protocol. The other
REAPERS in the line are ABUZZ.

                           DEATH
            ...I beg your pardon?

                           MONKEYBONE
            I got relatives there. I...EEP!!

CLOSEUP - ON STU - UNDER SHROUD

An ENRAGED STU is yanking on MONKEYBONE'S TAIL, signalling him to shut
up. MONKEYBONE, in pain, squeals repeatedly. Finally he reaches down and
PUNCHES STU IN THE NOSE.

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - BACK TO SCENE

The blow sends STU staggering. DEATH and the other REAPERS look on in
astonishment as the STAINED REAPER does a bizarre DANCE across the
floor, top half and bottom half moving independently. Miraculously, he
manages to right himself and regain his balance.

                           DEATH
            Now what were you saying?

                        STU/MONKEYBONE
                 (in unison)
            Nothing.

                           DEATH
            I'd like to have a word with you in private.

He stands and gestures toward a side room. The boys follow. The little
HELLHOUND scampers out from behind the desk...

...and GRABS THE HEM OF THEIR SHROUD in its teeth! The boys keep on
walking, but the shroud stays behind. Somehow they go three or four
steps before they realize they've been exposed.

DEATH jumps a foot in the air and SHRIEKS. PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS.

                           DEATH
            IMPOSTORS!! GET 'EM!!

The boys back toward the big WINDOW overlooking the trainyard. The
REAPERS close in on them, BRANDISHING THEIR SCYTHES.

                           DEATH
            HYPNOS! That little twerp! He's the one who put
            you up to this!

With a SCREECH, MONKEYBONE LEAPS into the air, BOUNDS OVER the heads and
shoulders of the advancing REAPERS, and SNATCHES the yellow E-ticket
pouch from the guy Death gave it to.

He bounds over a table and into STU's arms, with the precious pouch in
hand! DEATH lets out a great rattling BELLOW OF RAGE.

His features begin to JITTER VIOLENTLY. HIS HEAD EXPLODES!!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Yowie.

Nothing to lose at this point. With a CRASH, the boys DIVE THROUGH THE
BIG WINDOW overlooking the trainyard!

The headless DEATH gropes around blindly, waving to his ASSISTANT.

                           DEATH
            Head. HEAD!!

The ASSISTANT opens a cabinet containing a half-dozen identical HEADS.
He pulls out a spare and screws it onto DEATH's neck.

EXT. TRAINYARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The boys land hard at the edge of the trainyard. Behind them, REAPERS
are shepherding a line of newly arrived DEAD PEOPLE past a sign which
reads: "PROCESSING - THIS WAY."

By the time they can dust themselves off, an ALARM starts blaring.
REAPERS drop what they're doing, point at the boys. Panic time!

Nearby, a FLYING BICYCLE is propped up against a SIGN. Side-by-side they
race toward the bike, each of them clutching the strap of the pouch,
YANKING each other back and forth in a tug-of-war.

STU's bigger. He pulls the pouch onto his shoulder, and MONKEYBONE with
it. They grab the bike, climb aboard, and pedal off -

- revealing the SIGN it was leaning against: "CYCLE REPAIR."

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE - THAT MOMENT

STU pedals onto the central turntable area. The BATWINGS on the rear of
the bike flap feebly, but the flying bike just won't fly.

MONKEYBONE looks over his shoulder. A small ARMY of REAPERS, anned with
scythes, is pouring into the trainyard behind them.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu...Stu...

                           STU
            IT'S NOT WORKING.

                           MONKEYBONE
            There's a thing here! There's a switch!

MONKEYBONE fiddles with the ignition switch. A BLACK CLOUD OF EXHAUST
belches violently from the rear of the bike, almost pitching them off
their seat. The batwings start to flap faster...

SPUT. BLAP. The engine BACKFIRES and DIES. STU fiddles with the switch,
but it's no go.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Stu...LOOK!

                           STU
            What?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Isn't that Lulu?

LULU is still sitting in her little car at the edge of the tracks, eyes
crossed, mouth agape. MONKEYBONE waves brightly. Then a mob of REAPERS
appears on either side of LULU's car, swarming out onto the tracks! STU
starts pedaling for his life.

He makes for the TRAIN TUNNELS in the far wall of the station.
ILLUMINATED SIGNS over the tunnels read: Calcutta...Hong Kong...Waco, TX
...and directly ahead...

Dark Town!! By now they're well out onto the turnaround. STU pedals
frantically, BOUNCING over tracks and ties. MONKEYBONE bites his
fingernails down to the quick as he watches the column of REAPERS
pursuing them onto the tracks.

INT. OFFICE - ON DEATH

watching through a crooked spyglass as the boys pedal down the tracks.

                           DEATH
            Now we've got 'em.

Petting his hellhound, he reaches for a WALL SWITCH.

EXT. TRAINYARD - HIGH ANGLE

The boys are almost at the Dark Town tunnel. The REAPERS, on foot, will
never be able to catch them. But as they pick up speed for the stretch
run, the GROUND begins to move beneath them!

DEATH has activated the TRAIN TURNAROUND - the rotating platform at the
end of the line which allows an engine to reverse direction. Before they
know it, they're doing a full 180!

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE

The boys continue to bounce down the tracks - but the tunnel entrances
seem to be SPINNING before their eyes. Before they know it, they're
pedaling directly TOWARD the mob of ANGRY REAPERS!!

                           MONKEYBONE
            Weren't we just here?

STU jerks the handlebars HARD RIGHT and JUMPS THE TRACK he's on. He
WINCES IN PAIN as the bike BOUNCES over a series of rails...

                           MONKEYBONE
            What'd I tell you? You go to the Land of Death,
            wear a jockstrap!

EXT. TRAINYARD - HIGH ANGLE

The REAPERS are SPREADING OUT around the turntable - encircling it! STU
rides around the periphery of the great turning platter, but there's no
getting off. They're completely surrounded!

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON BICYCLE

MONKEYBONE covers both eyes and wails in fear. But STU is rattling the
ignition switch, making ONE LAST EFFORT to get the bike aloft...

THE ENGINE CATCHES. Trailing black fumes, the BICYCLE RISES! The REAPERS
converge in its path, and RAISE THEIR SCYTHES...

But the bike JUST MANAGES TO CLEAR the tangle of scythes - leaving the
REAPERS slicing at empty air!

INT. OFFICE - ON DEATH

Through the big window, he sees the boys leveling off, flying toward the
DARK TOWN TUNNEL. They're moments away from a clean escape.

INT. STU'S ROOM - NIGHT

STU's readout monitors are registering frantic nightmare activity when
JULIE and ALICE enter. JULIE sets her purse on STU's bedside table -
removes a SYRINGE and a test tube filled with PURPLISH FLUID.

                           JULIE
            What's the maximum safe dose?

                           ALICE
            Most we've ever used is half a CC.

                           JULIE
            Five CC's.

CLOSEUP - DEATH

He unlocks a RED SECURITY BOX on his wall. Inside is a TOGGLE SWITCH
labelled "FATE WORSE THAN DEATH." He flips it...

CLOSEUP - THE SYRINGE

The plunger goes down, injecting fluid into STU...

EXT. TRAINYARD - ON FLYING BIKE

MONKEYBONE is sitting on STU's shoulder, facing backward, thumbing his
nose at the REAPERS. STU glances back as well, laughing, unable to
believe his own good luck.

Since they're both looking the wrong way, neither of them sees the
sheer, monolithic WALL rising up DIRECTLY IN THEIR PATH.

It's no ordinary wall. It's STU'S PAINTING - the one ALICE found in the
closet, the wolf-surgeon canvas from his scary period -

- and as the bicycle SLAMS INTO IT, it begins to TOPPLE OVER - PINNING
STU against the ground underneath!

STU'S DREAMSCAPE

No bike. No monkey. Just STU - who finds himself on an operating table,
with the world of the painting coming to 3-D life around him. The WOLF-
FACED SURGEONS are closing in on him, baring their fangs, brandishing
their scalpels and their metallic REPLACEMENT PARTS...

Suddenly the fabric of this weird reality TEARS - just like a rip in a
canvas. A FURRY PAW reaches through - GRABS STU by the hand...

                           MONKEYBONE
            This ain't my nightmare!

EXT. TRAINYARD - JUST OUTSIDE TUNNEL

MONKEYBONE PULLS STU through the rip in the back of the giant toppled
canvas. The bike's there waiting. They hop aboard and pedal off INTO THE
DARK TOWN TUNNEL a split-second before the REAPERS arrive to slice them
to ribbons.

INT. DARK TOWN TUNNEL - ON BICYCLE

STU pedals so hard his heart is about to burst. He feels down at his
side - the yellow pouch containing the E-ticket is still there. The
REAPERS are clustered at the mouth of the tunnel, but they aren't
following.

The boys WEEP WITH GLEE. It's a miracle - they've cheated Death!

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DARK TOWN GATES - NIGHT

An exhausted STU huffs and puffs as he pedals the bike up the last
stretch of track to the platform outside the gates. He climbs off the
bike and stares back - it looks like the last thousand miles or so have
all been uphill. He slings the YELLOW POUCH over his shoulder...

                           STU
            You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've
            made it without you.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.

                           STU
            It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like
            there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's
            gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay
            when I'm gone?

                           MONKEYBONE
            Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.

                           STU
            You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure
            wish I could take you home with me.

The gates slide open. STU passes through. But MONKEYBONE lingers behind
a moment - just long enough for one of the SINGING SPHINXES to slip him
a big, nasty BASEBALL BAT.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well,
            there's a new twist.

                           STU
            Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I
            really do love y--

He turns - and MONKEYBONE MARK McGWIRES HIM upside the head! STU
crumples in a heap...

                           MONKEYBONE
            Love you too. Boss.

Laughing maniacally, MONKEYBONE STEALS the E-TICKET and goes RACING OFF
DOWN THE MIDWAY!!

STU'S HEAD is swimming. It takes him a few seconds, but he gets to his
feet. By now, MONKEYBONE is halfway to the E-ticket ride. Worse yet,
STU'S WATCH reads 8:59 AM!!!

                           STU
            Stop! Monkeybone! Please!!

EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - NIGHT

The STREETS ARE LINED with Darktowners ROOTING MONKEYBONE ON as if he's
the hometown favorite in a big footrace. Which he is.

MONKEYBONE reaches the E-TICKET RIDE - drops his E-TICKET into the
receptacle at the gate. The drawbridge lowers...

As STU sprints down the street, the SNAIL MAN oozes into his path - and
TRIPS HIM! Before he can get up, cackling DARKTOWNERS converge on him -
forcing him back to the ground and HOLDING HIM THERE.

                           STU
            NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET!
            HE'S GOT MY -

                           HYPNOS
            Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got
            big plans for that body of yours!

EXT. E-TICKET RIDE - ON MONKEYBONE

The familiar miasma of COLORS is beginning to swirl in the night sky
overhead. MONKEYBONE straps on a NEEDLE-TIPPED HELMET which makes him
look like a simian DART. Then he climbs into the seat of the TEST-YOUR-
STRENGTH machine and braces himself for the big ride!

EXT. DARK TOWN PLAZA - THAT MOMENT - RIGHT

ONLOOKERS APPLAUD as the robot lifts its mallet and LETS FLY. DING!! The
tiny figure of MONKEYBONE soars toward the swirling colors. His DART-
HELMET strikes the black hole dead center.

STU WATCHES HELPLESSLY as MONKEYBONE penetrates the veil of the sky and
VANISHES. He's still SCREAMING when the cackling DARKTOWNERS drag him
out of the plaza by the heels...

                           STU
            NO! JULIE! NO-O-O-O!

AERIAL SHOT - ON MONKEYBONE

ROCKETING UPWARD through the clouds in his dart-helmet, a look of SHEER
EXHILARATION on his simian face. Somewhere a CLOCK begins to chime the
hour...


INT. STU'S PRIVATE ROOM - 8:59 AM - DAY

MOST OF OUR CAST is either in STU's room or in the hallway outside.

PLUS we've got a man of the cloth; two LEGAL TYPES, with briefcases; and
several of the NURSES from the facility.

ALICE squeezes JULIE's hand, and JULIE squeezes STU's. The minute hand
on the clock hits twelve. KIMMY, sobbing into a handkerchief, gives DR.
EDELSTEIN the nod. As he reaches for the power switch...

                           STU
            EEEEEEPP!!

JULIE DROPS the hand with a gasp. The DOCTOR jumps half a foot.

All at once STU is sitting BOLT UPRIGHT IN BED...shaking his head and
feeling around gingerly under the bedclothes, as if something VERY SHARP
has just poked him in the ass.

                           STU
            Oooie! That smarts!!!

KIMMY sighs and FAINTS DEAD AWAY.

STU blinks and looks about the room, disoriented. It could be because
he's just come out of a coma after seven months. Or it could be because
he's a MONKEY unaccustomed to hanging out in a human body.

                           JULIE
            Stu?

                           STU
            Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.

A BURST OF LAUGHTER from the others in the room. Weeping TEARS OF JOY,
JULIE flings herself across the bed and hugs him tight.

While JULIE is hugging him, STU is checking out his new fingers and
toes, RUBBING his sparse patch of CHEST FUR. DOCTORS and NURSES look on
in amazement from the doorway.

                           NURSE
            It's a miracle. It's a miracle.

                           DOCTOR
            Two more ticks of the clock...

STU is almost oblivious to JULIE. He lifts up the sheet, sneaks a quick
peek at his CROTCH, and grins delightedly.

JULIE gives him another kiss, WHISPERS in his ear:

                           JULIE
            Thank you. Thank you for coming back to me.

What she doesn't know is that, although he still looks like STU, his
body is now occupied by MONKEYBONE. Since he's now a hybrid character,
man on the outside and monkey within, let's call him...

                           STU-BONE
            Boy, I don't know about you guys, but I'm
            starving.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

A damp, stonewalled VAULT with a barred door. STU is sprawled on the
floor, OUT COLD, when a VOICE awakes him...

                           RAT GUARD (o.s.)
            Heads up! Feeding time!

STU comes around just in time to see a PANEL sliding open in the ceiling
far overhead. A torrent of JUNK - stale popcorn, half-eaten candy bars,
molten ice cream pops, and sticky soda - rains down ON HIS FACE.

A horde of DARK FIGURES emerge from the shadowy catacombs around him.
All at once, HANDS are grabbing at him from all directions. STU lets out
a SCREAM - backs up against a wall -

                           STU
            Who are y-- WHAT DO YOU WANT??

A MONGOL WARRIOR with a droopy mustache looks up at him.

                           GENGHIS KHAN
            Dinner.

After a moment STU realizes that the DARK FIGURES have almost no
interest in him - instead, they've been grabbing at the half-eaten
SNACKS that cascaded down onto his head. A long-haired SLAV - RASPUTIN -
dives on a Hershey bar with only one bite out of it, but an oddly
familiar FAT MAN gets there first. STU gapes at him...

                           STU
            Alfred Hitchcock??

                           EDGAR ALLAN POE
            A fat bastard, but damn quick on his feet.

                           TYPHOID MARY
            That's how he keeps his girlish figure.

                           STEPHEN KING
            Gotta move fast in this crowd, or you'll starve.
            Here you go, pal. Have some popcorn.

He offers STU a box of popcorn soaked in Dr. Pepper.

                           STU
            What is this stuff?

                           STEPHEN KING
            They feed us the slops from the Morpheum
            Theatre. You hope for Jujubes, settle for
            goobers. - I'm Steve. Steve King.

                           STU
            Stephen King? What are you doing in here?

Various OTHERS emerge from the shadows to shake STU's hand.

                           JACK THE RIPPER
            I'm Jack the Ripper.

                           TYPHOID MARY
            Typhoid Mary.

                           ATILLA THE HUN
            Atilla the Hun. Trade you a Twizzler for a box
            of Raisinets!

                           STU
            Atilla the - ! What in hell is this place?

As if in reply, a FANFARE sounds in the distance...


INT. DUNGEON - ENTRANCE

A RAT GUARD stands at attention by the door, TOOTING HIS KAZOO to
announce the arrival of an honored guest.

                           RAT GUARD
            All hail the most glorious! Most eminent! Most
            esteemed all-powerful God of Sleep...his Royal
            Lassitude -

                           HYPNOS
            Enough, enough, I'm hung over.

As HYPNOS passes, the DUNGEON DWELLERS race up to the WALL OF BARS that
separates the entry area from the dungeon proper.

                           TYPHOID MARY
            Hyp! Did you bring me the cough medicine?

                           STEPHEN KING
            Did you remember the night light I asked for?

                           EDGAR ALLAN POE
            King, you pussy.

                           STEPHEN KING
            Bite me, Poe! I hate waking up in the dark.

                           HYPNOS
            Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new
            guest settling in - ?

                           STU
            YOU SET ME UP!!

STU LUNGES at HYPNOS - who backs up just out of reach.

                           HYPNOS
            Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It
            ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets.
            Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and
            that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?

                           STU
            Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?

                           HYPNOS
            It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of
            'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy
            up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker!
            Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been
            doing this all the way back to Atilla and
            Genghis Khan!

                           STU
            But why me? Why'd you pick on me??

                           HYPNOS
            The monkey, of course. It was his idea.

                           STU
            Monkeybone...!?

                           HYPNOS
            Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day
            he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help
            him get your body...in return he gives us all
            the nightmares we want.

                           STU
            You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he
            gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??

                           HYPNOS
            Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that
            girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical
            basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a
            big old batch of nightmare juice!

STU's face goes white as he realizes the point of the master plan.

                           HYPNOS
            Oh, we're predicting a record box-office. It's
            like I always say...nightmares are your best
            entertainment!

HYPNOS marches off, chuckling. STU's head sinks into his hands.


EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

STU's back from the hospital. JULIE is removing his bags from the trunk
of KIMMY's car while STU and KIMMY chat in the front seat.

                           KIMMY
            I just couldn't stand the thought of you
            suffering. I love you so, I would never have...
            forgive me, Stu. Please forgive me.

                           STU-BONE
            Kimmy. Chill. We've still got a pact. If
            anything ever happens to you, I'll be right
            there to return the favor.
                 (baring his teeth)
            So drive carefully! From now on.

He climbs out. KIMMY is so rattled that she smacks bumpers with the car
parked in front of her. She PEELS OUT with the hand brake still on.

INT. STU & JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

STU-BONE and JULIE enter with luggage. He stands there for a moment
scoping out the unfamiliar surroundings. She sets the bags down, taps
him on the shoulder.

                           JULIE
            Welcome home.

STU-BONE grins insipidly. She kisses him, pulls him into a tight embrace
- and then, overwhelmed by emotion, begins to SOB.

                           JULIE
            Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.

                           STU-BONE
            Home sweet home, huh? Actually, I was expecting
            something a little swankier. How much loot does
            old Stu rake in, anyway?

She gives him an extremely puzzled look.

                           STU-BONE
            Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself.
            You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty
            lucrative franchise...

                           JULIE
            Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for
            a minute. I'll be right back.

She goes into the kitchen as STU-BONE plops onto the sofa. He spies a
bowl of FRESH FRUIT on the coffee table and immediately tries to pick up
a banana with his FOOT.

But he can't. He's got shoes on. Frowning, he unties his shoe, peels off
his sock. His bare foot is in the fruit bowl when JULIE returns from the
kitchen with a TRAY holding a chocolate cake and the bottle of CHAMPAGNE
Stu bought three months ago. The cake bears the message "WELCOME HOME -
I LOVE YOU" in pink icing.

She sits beside him with the goodies. He removes his foot from the bowl,
crosses his legs, WIGGLES HIS TOES at her. She smiles uncertainly. Then
she opens the bottle of champagne and pours two flutes full.

                           JULIE
            Here's to a bottle...we should have opened...
            three months ago.

She finishes pouring, hands a flute to STU-BONE. His face is smeared
with CAKE and ICING. He's scooped out a big fistful and crammed it right
into his pie hole. He GRINS at her.

                           STU-BONE
            Bitchin' good cake.

                           JULIE
            Stu, are you...feeling okay?

                           STU-BONE
            Sure. Why?

                           JULIE
            You're acting kind of...odd.

                           STU-BONE
                 (grabbing another fistful)

            In what way?

Then: we hear TINY NAILS skittering across the hardwood floors at high
speed. And BUSTER THE DOG races into the living room!

                           JULIE
            Buster! Look who's here!

STU-BONE tenses instinctively. The dog is yipping, wagging his tail
insanely at the sight of his long-lost master - until he gets just a
little bit closer, and senses that something is very, very wrong.

BUSTER sizes STU-BONE up and GROWLS. STU-BONE bares his teeth and
HISSES. The dog LUNGES - and STU-BONE jumps up on the sofa!

                           STU-BONE
            Oh shit, the cake!

He bends down, snatches up the cake, and CRADLES IT under one arm as he
KICKS AT BUSTER from the sofa.

                           STU-BONE
            Mine. Get back! MINE!!

The frazzled JULIE pours herself another jolt of champagne - a stiff
one.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

SOUNDS of JULIE taking a shower in the adjacent bathroom o.s.

STU-BONE is sprawled in bed, pillows propped up behind him, flipping
channels on the bedroom TV with his trusty remote. The Discovery Channel
happens to be showing a Jane Goodall special...

                           NARRATOR (on TV)
            The mating rituals of the African silverback are
            as rigidly formalized as those of any animal we
            know - with the possible exception of man.

Onscreen a FEMALE GORILLA is presenting her furry haunches to an ALPHA
MALE.

STU-BONE watches this erotic spectacle with a connoisseur's eye. He
glances over at the open bathroom door and catches a teasing glimpse of
JULIE'S SHADOW as she steps out of the shower and pulls on a robe. He
SCRATCHES and SNIFFS, just to put himself in the mood.

On TV: MONKEY FOREPLAY, which consists of a pounce from behind.

                           NARRATOR (on TV)
            In the wild, a dominant chimpanzee male is
            likely to engage in sex numerous times
            throughout the day, with a shockingly wide
            variety of -

STU-BONE mutes the nature special and sneaks up behind JULIE just as she
emerges from the bathroom in her robe and towel-turban.

                           JULIE
            What are you watching?

                           STU-BONE
            Ohhh, nothing.

She tries to pass, but he grabs the belt of her robe and spins her
around. He delicately unwraps the turban, then opens her robe and pulls
it closed around the two of them. They kiss...

                           JULIE
            You sure this is...medically advisable?

                           STU-BONE
            Got a doctor on duty.

                           JULIE
            Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -

STU-BONE almost lets out a gasp of shock. What does she mean???

                           JULIE
                 (glancing downward)

            - which it seems to be.

STU-BONE does a take. The good news is, she doesn't suspect. The bad
news is, he's apparently named after his creator's penis.

INT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

All at once the air is full of Barry White's lush baritone on the
bedroom CD player. Through the bedroom doorway we see STU-BONE and JULIE
waltzing romantically, belly to belly, still wrapped up in the single
robe.

The only jarring note is BUSTER'S FRANTIC BARKING. The poor dog is stuck
behind an accordion gate in the hall, going crazy, trying to warn his
mistress about the imposter in STU's body. The dog is almost drowning
out Barry White -

- so STU-BONE stops kissing JULIE long enough to reach over with one
foot and KICK THE DOOR SHUT.

INT. BEDROOM - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE watches from the bed as STU-BONE begins peeling off his PJ's,
going into a bizarrely formalized MONKEY MATING DANCE. He circles back
and forth from one side of the bed to the other, making faces, grunting,
FEINTING at her occasionally.

JULIE has some dim sense that this ritual is supposed to be erotic, but
in fact, it's making her damned nervous. She finds herself scrunching up
on the bed, trying to keep out of STU-BONE's way.

Now he LEAPS UP onto the foot of the bed. REARS BACK. And with an animal
howl of triumph, POUNCES AT JULIE!

Terrified, she rolls out of the way. STU-BONE'S SKULL slams into the
headboard.

                           JULIE
            Oh, God!! Baby! Are you -

Dazed, he sits up. He tries to stand, but his rubbery legs give way, and
he pitches over - CRACKING HIS SKULL AGAIN on the nightstand.

EXT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

JULIE helps a punchdrunk, staggering STU to the stairway.

                           STU
            How was it? I don't recall.

                           JULIE
            It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.

As they pass, BUSTER lets out a little growl of satisfaction from behind
his gate. HOLD ON THE DOG's satisfied expression as STU-BONE loses his
balance and topples down the stairs O.S.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT

RASPUTIN, ATILLA, JACK THE RIPPER and STEPHEN KING are engrossed in
their weekly Parcheesi game. STU is clinging to the bars, bemoaning his
fate.

                           STU
            I'm not like the rest of you. I'm just a regular
            guy! I'm not a "nightmare maker."

                           RASPUTIN
            Neither are we. We got our bodies hijacked just
            like you. The guys who replaced us are the
            nightmare makers!

                           ATTILA
            Like me. I was a mess sergeant in the Mongol
            Horde. I never wanted to be the Scourge of Asia.
            I just wanted a new recipe for yak!

                           JACK THE RIPPER
            I was Jack the Haberdasher.

                           STU
            But how? Did you all have sidekicks? Figments?
            ...Monkeys??

                           STEPHEN KING
            Hey, I got screwed over by my own dog. Go
            through hell to get that E-ticket, and who winds
            up in my body? That darn Cujo.

TYPHOID MARY runs past, GIGGLING, pursued by a huffing HITCHCOCK.

                           RASPUTIN
            He's sure got a thing for those icy blondes.

KAZOOS SOUND. The RAT GUARD appears to announce:

                           RAT GUARD
            Miley. You got a visitor.

                           STU
            ...Kitty?!?

At the sight of STU behind bars, she breaks down CRYING.

                           KITTY
            I'm so sorry, Stu. I wanted to tell you what was
            going on. I really, really liked you.

                           STU
            Kitty...my situation is really not important.
            The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with,
            and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.

                           KITTY
            You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck
            in this place, and only thinking of her.

                           STU
            Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her
            what Monkeybone is up to??

                           RAT GUARD
            Time's up! Break it up, you two.

The RAT GUARD pushes STU back with a prod. KITTY reaches out...

                           KITTY
            No! Give me a moment. Just to look at him. Oh,
            Stu. Oh, my sweet, sweet Stu.

As she gazes at him, love struck, the overhead PANEL opens and a deluge
of CRUD from the Morpheum lands directly on STU.

                           RAT GUARD
            Feeding time!

KITTY BAWLS inconsolably as the RAT GUARD leads her away.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

STU-BONE in pajamas and a head bandage, reading the morning funnies. He
pounds the table, practically WEEPING with hilarity at the MONKEYBONE
COMIC STRIP.

                           STU-BONE
            Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just kills me!

                           JULIE
            I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure
            you'll be okay?

                           STU-BONE
            Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get.
            "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a
            big story! That's front page news! But I can't
            find a word of coverage in this stinkin' rag!
                 (shuffling through the paper)
            Hey. Don't I have a TV show?

                           JULIE
            They only made the one episode. They've shown it
            about nineteen times.

                           STU-BONE
            I need a new PR guy.

JULIE grins, plants a goodbye smooch on his forehead, and exits. He
waits a minute, then reaches for the PHONE.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. LIVING ROOM - EVENING

The house is crawling with PRESS. There must be three dozen REPORTERS
and PHOTOGRAPHERS and TV CREWS hanging on STU­BONE's every pronouncement.

                           STU-BONE
            Yes, being in a coma taught Stu Miley a thing or
            two about life. Buckle your seat belts, for one.
            But seriously, Stu Miley is a different man
            today. I'm much homier.

The front door opens. A stunned JULIE pushes her way inside...

                           STU-BONE
            And speaking of which, here's the light of my
            life, the pert and saucy Miss Julie McElroy.

                           JULIE
            I had to park two blocks away. Is something -

He pulls her to his side for a photo op. FLASHBULBS go off.

                           STU
            I took the liberty of calling a little press
            conference. We're on TV, so don't say "shit."
                 ­(covering his mouth)
            Shit! I said it. Shit! I said it again!

                           REPORTER
            Stu, what is it about Monkeybone that makes him
            so popular?

                           STU-BONE
            Well, it's partly that he punctures all the
            phony pretensions of our modern society...and
            it's partly that he's a breathtakin',
            heartbreakin', rump-shakin' sex machine!
                 (beat)
            Ask these gentlemen here. They're an important
            cog in my media machine. They'll be doing six
            new episodes of the Monkeybone show under my
            personal supervision.

He pauses for a photo op with MIKE CACHUELA and MIKE MITCHELL.

                           STU-BONE
            It's all synergy. The show synergizes the strip,
            which synergizes the merchandising, which
            synergizes the religion, which synergizes the
            Barbara Walters special; and then, baby, we are
            all in the United Empire of Monkeybonia.


INT. KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE squeezes through the crowd, finds HERB working the phone.

                           HERB
            I tell you, he's ready to merchandise. We've
            gotta move quickly. Get the toy guys, the burger
            guys, the lunchbox guys -

                           JULIE
            Herb...what in God's name -

HERB holds up a finger. He's too busy talking. STU-BONE enters with the
video crew in tow. JULIE somehow manages to sideline him.

                           JULIE
            What's this about merchandising? You always
            hated merchandising!

                           STU-BONE
            Well, baby, I do, but to look at it from another
            angle...there's a potload of money here.

                                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. STREET - DAY

SUPERCHARGED POP MUSIC underneath as STU-BONE comes running around a
corner - followed, a moment later, by a SCREAMING HORDE of BEAUTIFUL
GROUPIES in black miniskirts and high heels. It's like something out of

A Hard Day's Night, only more so.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

TIGHT on STU-BONE, head still bandaged, eyes closed, SNORING slightly.
He wears a big monkey grin as he DREAMS the above.

EXT. STREET - DAY

A CARLOAD OF SUPERMODELS. They kill their engine in the middle of a busy
intersection and climb out to join the mob chasing STU-BONE.

He cuts around a corner, ducks into an alley, and FLATTENS HIMSELF
behind a dumpster. As the girls run past, he pulls out a handkerchief
and MOPS SWEAT from his brow.

Then, with a what-the-hell twinkle, he steps out and FLINGS HIS SWEATY
HANKIE into the midst of the GROUPIES. A CATFIGHT ensues as they
scramble after this precious memento. The chase resumes.

Suddenly he realizes he's SLOWING DOWN...running in SLO-MO. Same deal
with the girls on his trail. After a moment, he FREEZES. He can't move
anything except his EYES; he looks right, left, up, down...

...and suddenly he sees HYPNOS winking into view directly in front of
him! HYPNOS is perfectly capable of moving. He strolls right up to the
frozen STU-BONE and SLAPS HIM REPEATEDLY, Moe Howard-style.

                           HYPNOS
            You two-bit simian stooge. WHAT THE HELL IS
            THIS? We didn't send you up here to shake your
            booty and chase broads. We sent you up to make
            nightmares!!

STU-BONE tries to speak. All that comes out is a slo-mo DRAWL.

                           HYPNOS
            Now find that nightmare juice and get to work.
            'Cause you may be a free man during the day...
            but when you dream, your monkey ass is mine!

He winds up - throws a ROUNDHOUSE PUNCH at STU-BONE'S FACE.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

STU-BONE sits up suddenly in bed. For a moment he's relieved - it was
all a dream. Then he realizes his FACE is swelling like a
prizefighter's. His front tooth is loose. BLOOD is streaming from his
nose!

                           STU-BONE
            Eep!

INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

He's awake, fully dressed, and fishing around in the pocket of JULIE's
topcoat. He finds her KEY RING and tiptoes furtively to the front door.

                           STU-BONE
            Friggin' Hypnos. I'll show him...

INT. SLEEP LAB - NIGHT

He unlocks the door and enters the darkened lab. Finds the dispensary
area and kneels beside a LOCKED REFRIGERATOR. Then he shuffles through
the keys on the ring until he finds one labelled "FRIDGE."

On the top shelf is a corked beaker of purple fluid bearing the label
"ONEIRIX" with red DANGER stickers all over it. STU-BONE takes it out,
flashes a sinister grin, and EMPTIES ITS CONTENTS into a similar beaker.
Then he refills the original from a hip flask and replaces it.

He's just about to leave when he's startled by a series of SIMIAN GRUNTS
and SQUEAKS - which are TRANSLATED in SUBTITLE:

                           FEMALE BABOON
            Hey, handsome.

He turns and spots a SEDUCTIVE FEMALE BABOON who's confmed to a CAGE in
the corner. The conversation continues in MONKEY TALK.

                           FEMALE BABOON
            Yeah, you. Come here, good-looking.
                 (beat)
            Why don't you let me out of this cage?

                           STU-BONE
            Hey, I'd love to, baby, but...it'd put me in hot
            water.

                           FEMALE BABOON
                 (caressing his chin)
            I know how to be very, very grateful.

He pulls out a MATCHBOOK and scribbles a number on it.

                           STU-BONE
            Tell you what, angel. When you get out, give me
            a call...

A LIGHT goes on suddenly in the outside hallway! STU-BONE tries to dive
for cover, but the FEMALE BABOON grabs him by the belt and pulls him
against the cage.

Startled, he drops the ONEIRIX BEAKER - which rolls out into the hall!

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The beaker CLATTERS LOUDLY as it rolls through the lab door. STU-BONE'S
HANDS grope through the doorway - but the FEMALE BABOON has got him by
the pants leg and won't let go, no matter how much he rattles the cage.
He can't quite pull himself through the door...

He unbuckles the belt. UNZIPS HIS PANTS. Keeps clawing toward the
beaker. But he still can't quite make it, and the BABOON won't let go.

Now his pants are down around his knees. He keeps wriggling until his
pants legs are entirely INSIDE OUT - and still he can't quite reach the
beaker! His shoes are caught in his pants cuffs! RRRRRIPPPPP...

Freedom! Minus his pants, he GRABS THE BEAKER.

In FG through all this is a dim teenage JANITOR pushing his electric
floor polisher. He has his Walkman on and he can't hear any of the
mayhem behind him. He sings along atonally with the music:

                           JANITOR
            Gettin' jiggy wit' it - gettin' jiggy wit' it...

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

A disheveled STU-BONE, back from his secret mission, is trying to take
his clothes off so he won't wake JULIE. But she starts to rouse, so he
jumps into bed fully dressed and pulls up the covers.

                           JULIE
            Stu? Is that you? Where did you go?

                           STU-BONE
            Me? Nowhere. I was asleep.

                           JULIE
            Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.

                           STU-BONE
            Not me. Nope. You must've been dreaming.

She pulls the covers back. He's still wearing his topcoat, shoes, socks,
and shorts...but NO PANTS.

                           JULIE
            You're wearing a topcoat, Stu. - Where are your
            pants?

                           STU-BONE
            Well, Miss Smarty, if I didn't go out, I
            wouldn't need any pants. Now would I?

He pulls the covers up to his chin. The two of them lie there in the
dark staring up at the ceiling.


INT. STU'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

The entire Monkeybone brain trust has come to visit: HERB, syndicate
head MR. BOWERS, and several CORPORATE REPS hoping to arrange tie-in
deals. Host STU-BONE has started to take on a simian look: more
prominent ears, flared nostrils, heavy beard stubble, etc.

The BURGER GOD REP sets a tray of FAST FOOD in front of STU-BONE - the
packaging all covered with angelic haloed Monkeybones.

                           BURGER GOD REP
            As you know, Burger God has 1700 outlets
            nationwide...we're prepared to back a major TV
            buy to launch our Mega Monkey Meal.
                 (beat)
            Go ahead. Try a bite.

STU-BONE takes a bite out of his Monkeyburger - looks pleased at first -
then begins PICKING something out of his teeth.

                           HERB
            What's the matter?

                           STU-BONE
            I think it's a pig hair.
                 (examining a contract)
            How much is McDonald's offering?

                           HERB
            Less.

STU-BONE immediately signs the contract and shakes hands with the BURGER
GOD REP. HERB consults his agenda.

                           HERB
            Oh, here's something. The city zoo is kicking
            off a fund-raising campaign. They wonder if
            you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.

                           STU-BONE
            How much?

                           HERB
            Well, nothing. It's a benefit. But we could
            probably get People and Entertainment Tonight to
            cover it.

                           STU-BONE
            I get it. We could give the public the
            impression that we were doing something...
            charitable. Brilliant!!

                           HERB
            And last...you remember Bill here, from the
            Bazoom Toy Company? He's got a little something
            I think you'll like.

The TOY REP sets a LOCKBOX on the table. A stencil on the box reads "TOP
SECRET." He pulls out a key and opens it to reveal...

...a tuxedoed, collector's-edition MONKEYBONE DOLL lying on a bed of
CRUSHED PURPLE VELVET. He carefully removes the treasure from its chest.
Its right hand is hinged. The doll's thumb is UP ITS REAR.

                           BAZOOM TOY REP
            It's a prototype. Code name "Little Jack
            Horner." Go on - pull out his thumb.

STU-BONE stares at the doll - cautiously yanks its thumb out. We go to
SLO-MO as the rising arm causes a NOXIOUS AEROSOL SPRAY to shoot out of
Monkeybone's ass!

And we STAY in slo-mo as STU-BONE stares at the doll in wonderment and
awe...a man in looooove.

Still in slo-mo, the EXECS crack up, gag, hold their noses at the awful
stank of it. STU-BONE is the only one not laughing. He reaches out to
touch the doll - to fondle it adoringly -

- and suddenly we're back to REAL-TIME.

                           BAZOOM TOY REP
            You know kids - they love anything gross...

                           STU-BONE
            Kids? Kids?! This is a work of genius. This is
            art. This is the answer to all my prayers!
                 (beat)

            Say - just a technical question - could you fill
            these babies up with a particulate solution of
            one part chemical enzyme to ten parts water?

                           BAZOOM EXEC
            Well - I guess...

                           STU-BONE
            Aww righhhhht!

He breaks into RIOTOUS LAUGHTER and begins blasting monkeyfarts at HERB
and the EXECS, who dive for cover under the conference table.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

Laughter and back-slapping as STU-BONE walks his guests to their cars.

                           STU
            So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo
            benefit. We get a big piñata. We fill it with
            Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.

                           HERB
            A piñata. That's a great idea!

                           STU-BONE
            You guys don't know it, but you just saved my
            ass!

With a big grin, he pantomimes sticking a thumb up his ass, in obvious
imitation of the doll, and then gives the thumbs-up sign. The unnerved
EXECS gape at him as he goes back inside - he's developed an odd, loping
gait, and his arms swing outward in wide arcs as he walks.

                           BURGER GOD EXEC
            Interesting fellow.

                           HERB
            Head trauma.

INT. STU'S KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT

He digs around under the sink, finds the purple beaker of ONEIRIX. Looks
at the FARTING DOLL...and GRINS.

                           STU-BONE
            This'll get him off my back!

INSERT - TV SCREEN

A PROMO for the MONKEYBONE cartoon show. MONKEYBONE swings across the
screen on a vine, followed by a string of grinning, live-action FANS
doing a scratch 'n' sniff, pull-out-a-plum LINE DANCE.

                           ANNOUNCER
            It's his world - we just live in it. Monkeybone!
            Back with six all-new episodes, starting -

INT. LIVING ROOM - REVERSE ANGLE - NIGHT

A distraught JULIE mutes the TV. Her friend ALICE is on the sofa beside
her, having coffee and dessert.

                           JULIE
            The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's
            acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to
            be.

                           ALICE
            Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.

                           JULIE
            I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure
            it did. It's as if...he's not Stu any more. The
            Stu I love is gone!
                 (beat)

            He spends all his time in the garage. He says
            he's...autographing.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

TIGHT ON the flask of ONEIRIX as STU-BONE picks it up.

He's wearing a GAS MASK. He's rigged a CLOTHESLINE in the garage.
MONKEYBONE DOLLS are clipped to it, ass-end up - forming a makeshift
ASSEMBLY LINE. He dips a TURKEY BASTER into the flask...withdraws a
quantity of purple fluid...plucks the FINGER out of the first doll's
behind...

- and plunges the TURKEY BASTER into the doll's hindquarters, filling it
with ONEIRIX!! The doll's buttocks take on the purple hue characteristic
of Orangutans in heat. STU-BONE holds the doll at arm's length and pulls
its finger - launching a purple puff of SPIKED NIGHTMARE GAS.

                           STU-BONE
            Yeah, baby! Nightmare-in-a-butt!
                 (looking around)
            Okay...guinea pig, guinea pig...

EXT. GARAGE/BACK YARD - NIGHT

STU-BONE steps out into the driveway and hears a low growl - BUSTER is
giving him the stinkeye from behind the picket fence. STU-BONE's eyes
light up with inspiration.

                           STU-BONE
            C'mere, boy...c'mere, ole buddy...

INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT

LOUD BARKING outside. JULIE wanders over toward the window.

                           ALICE
            Listen. Let's bring him in for some tests. I
            guarantee you're overreacting.

JULIE lifts the curtain - and sees STU-BONE in his gas mask, bent over
in a weird crab like stance, chasing BUSTER around the yard with the
Monkeybone doll.

JULIE doesn't seem especially surprised - but ALICE's mouth falls open.

                           JULIE
            Actually, no, I don't think I'm overreacting.

EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

BUSTER is apparently ALONE now - he's pacing in circles under a HIGH
TREE BRANCH, staring up and GROWLING. Someone throws a PINE CONE at the
picket fence. BUSTER'S HEAD TURNS, just for an instant -

                           STU-BONE
            KREEEGAHHHH!!!

- and STU-BONE plunges out of the tree, DIRECTLY ON TOP OF THE DOG! The
two of them GRAPPLE, rolling around on the grass.

For a moment it looks like this battle royale could go either way. Then
STU-BONE gets on top of BUSTER, STRADDLES HIM, shoves the ASS of the
Monkeybone doll up against his muzzle...

FOONT! A purple cloud of NIGHTMARE GAS hits BUSTER in the face. The dog
goes limp. His eyes roll back in his head. He starts to TWITCH.

                           STU-BONE
            Sweet dreams, you little bastard!

Disheveled but triumphant, STU-BONE stands up, pounds his chest with
both fists, and lets out a Tarzanian ROAR. Lights go on all over the
neighborhood. ANGRY NEIGHBORS poke their heads out the windows.

INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

STU-BONE skulks back into the garage. He throws back a tarp, revealing
HUNDREDS of boxed Monkeybone dolls, stacked so high they fill an entire
wall of the garage. He pulls out his turkey baster, cranks up the
clothesline, and goes to work.

EXT. BACK YARD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

CAMERA TRACKS IN on the twitching face of BUSTER, and we see

BUSTER'S DREAM (BLACK & WHITE)

A German-expressionist nightmare, all low angles and heavy shadows.
We're in some kind of OPERATING ROOM, where a struggling PATIENT is
being wheeled in on a tall, creaking GURNEY. Four ORDERLIES in surgical
masks are holding him down.

The PATIENT is BUSTER. And the ORDERLIES...are CATS.

A CAT SURGEON draws the sheet back. Looks at the spreadeagled BUSTER.
And brandishes a big nasty pair of GARDEN SHEARS.

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

The Dark Town audience is scratching its collective head at Buster's
dream, which is showing in one of HYP'S NIGHTMARE ORBS. An angry HYPNOS
slams down the phone and storms across the dance floor to his big
circular bed.

                           HYPNOS
            Dog dreams!! That stinkin' monkey. I can't
            believe it. We give him a body, and he sends us
            ...dogs.

A FELINE BEAUTY embraces him from behind, pulls him onto the bed.

                           KITTY
            Let's not think about dogs. Let's think about
            pussycats. Meeowwwwwwrrrr....

She draws ONE SHARP CLAW lightly down his chest. He gives her a now-
you're-talkin' grin and hits a switch - causing the big circular bed to
ROTATE off the dance floor and into the boudoir.

As it turns, we see KITTY'S PAW closing discreetly around a KEY CHAIN on
the nightstand...

INT. DUNGEON - RIGHT

STU's curled up on the dank floor when he's awakened by the sound of a
VISITOR in the corridor outside - KITTY. She passes a sack containing
FOOD and BOTTLED WATER through the bars - and SHUSHES the astonished STU
before he can speak.

                           KITTY
            Shh! You'll need it when you're traveling.

Glancing back at the GUARDS, she pulls a KEY from her cleavage.

                           KITTY
            Don't ask where I got it.

                           STU
            You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!

                           KITTY
            You're the only true-hearted man I ever met. You
            find a way back to that girl of yours and make
            her happy.

                           STU
            How am I gonna get past the guards?

                           KITTY
            I'll worry about the guards.
                 (loudly)

            OKAY, STU. SEE YOU IN A DAY OR TWO.

She turns down the corridor. STU stands there for a beat, GAPING at the
key in his hand.

Then he hears the sound of CARNAGE outside. A FEROCIOUS, BLOODY BATTLE
seems to be underway. Realizing that KITTY must be in trouble, he uses
the key to unlock the dungeon door.

INT. DUNGEON - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT

He finds KITTY hunched in the corner on all fours, surrounded by blood
and tufts of fur and an abandoned GUARD'S HAT.

                           KITTY
            Go. Just go.

                           STU
            Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--

She looks up at him, feline eyes aglow. There's a three-foot-long
RODENT'S TAIL dangling out of her mouth.

                           STU
            I'll really...never...forget you.

He races off as KITTY resumes her feast. The sound of fighting has
roused the other DUNGEON DWELLERS, and when they realize the dungeon
door is open they come rushing out en masse.

Then the PANEL opens. They hear FOOD raining down behind them. HITCHCOCK
is the first to turn back - then STEPHEN KING - then ATILLA. A moment
later they're back to their old habits, climbing over one another to get
at a half-empty box of Raisinets.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. SLEEP LAB - DAY

The usual gang sitting around at their computer terminals, etc. JULIE is
coolly reading NOTEBOOK ENTRIES into a TAPE RECORDER.

                           JULIE
            "4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation,
            prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet.
            Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating
            utensils...with feet."

                           ALICE
            They had a case like that at Johns Hopkins.
            Wires got crossed between hands and feet.

                           CLARISSA
            Great lead. I'll try and find it on the net.

                           JULIE
            "4/18: Subject climbs backyard tree...to perform
            elimination. When confronted with product...
            blames it on family dog."

DEAD SILENCE from the mortified group. They never had a case like that
at Johns Hopkins. JULIE somehow keeps a stiff upper lip - deeply
embarrassed for STU, but a scientist nonetheless.

                           HUTCH
            Seems perfectly obvious. He's been possessed by
            a monkey!

The others all GLOWER at HUTCH for this egregious display of bad taste.

EXT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON

STU-BONE and HERB are standing outside the garage in formal attire as a
crew of ZOO WORKERS load MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a pickup.

                           HERB
            You're really gonna pop the question?

                           STU-BONE
            Got the ring. Got the airline tickets. Soon as
            they break that piñata, we'll grab a cab - and
            it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.

                           HERB
            I can't believe you. You used to hate being the
            center of attention. Now you're proposing, in
            public, at a benefit.

                           STU-BONE
            Yeah, I was thinking...I mean, I'm a celebrity
            now, do I really want to get married? But on the
            other hand, if you're married, they can't
            testify against you.

HERB wonders if this is a joke, decides it is, and forces a chuckle.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

JULIE is getting dressed for the benefit when the PHONE RINGS.

                           JULIE
            Hello? Oh, Hutch - what?

INTERCUT - JULIE AND HUTCH

HUTCH is at the sleep lab, standing over the open refrigerator.

                           HUTCH
            The Nightmare Juice! It's gone! Somebody
            switched it for a beaker of grape Kool-Aid!!

                           JULIE
            Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -

Her eyes move to the WINDOW - to STU-BONE out by the garage.

                           JULIE
            Okay. Call the police. I'll be right over.

INT. SLEEP LAB - LATE AFTERNOON

Two DETECTIVES examining the scene of the crime.

                           JULIE
            The technical name is Oneirix. It's an enzyme.
            It's present in the brains of -

                           DETECTIVE
                 (cutting her off; writing)
            Yeah, yeah...Nightmare juice.

                           DETECTIVE II
            And there's been no sign of a break-in?

                           HUTCH
            Holy shit...the pants.
                 (remembering)
            The janitor found a pair of torn-up pants. It
            was the same night the monkey tipped her cage
            over. Remember that, Julie?

                           JULIE
                 (suddenly afraid)
            Yeah...I remember it vividly.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

LIVERIED WAITERS scurrying all about in preparation for the benefit. ZOO
WORKERS set up tables and chairs underneath a giant CANOPY.

STU-BONE watches with satisfaction as the last of the DOLLS is loaded
into a giant piñata in the shape of STANLEY.

                                                    WIPE TO:

INT. DEATH'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The big creaky swivel chair swings around, revealing DEATH.

                           DEATH
            Now, if I may ask - what kind of idiot sneaks
            into the Land of Death twice?

The party he's addressing is STU - who's stretched out horizontally,
strapped to a medieval TORTURE RACK, with a whole posse of GRIM REAPERS
standing guard around him.

                           STU
            You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to
            be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both
            mad at Hypnos.

                           DEATH
            Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all
            his idea. You were completely innocent -

                           STU
            I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E-
            ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right
            in the face to get it - and I'd do the same
            again.

                           DEATH
            Why??

                           STU
            I have a girl up there. And I never - I
            should've - I just want to tell her I love her.

                           DEATH
            I'm a simple man. I'm just doing my job. I enjoy

            my job. Why does everyone want to make it
            difficult for me? Stealing tickets, switching
            bodies...it is so irresponsible.

                           STU
            Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my
            soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me
            just one lousy hour.

                           DEATH
            Well - you'd need a body.

DEATH gestures for the REAPERS to unshackle STU.

                           DEATH
            If it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, I
            wouldn't be doing this. But a good chuckle is
            darned hard to come by.
                 (chortling)
            That one where Monkeybone stole the soap cake
            out of the urinal - I thought I would die.

                           STU
            Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.

                           DEATH
            De nada. Now, come here...bend over...before I
            change my mind.

                           STU
            Bend over?

DEATH rears back and KICKS HIM, full-force, SMACK IN THE ASS. The
supernatural might of the blow sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD THROUGH THE
CEILING!!

INT. HOSPITAL - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

A TEAM OF SURGEONS. The lead SURGEON has his arm buried up to the elbow
in the open torso of an ORGAN DONOR.

                           SURGEON
            Okay...detaching the left kidney...

SCREAMS ALL AROUND as the ORGAN DONOR sits BOLT UPRIGHT! The startled
SURGEON drops the kidney back into place.

                           ORGAN DONOR
            What the - who the hell am I??

                           SURGEON
            You're an organ donor!

                           ORGAN DONOR
            Am I dead?!?

                           SURGEON
            The chute didn't open. We kind of assumed -

                           ORGAN DONOR
            I need this body. Just for a few minutes. I'll
            bring it back, okay?

The ORGAN DONOR grabs a lab coat from a nearby rack and races out. (And
since STU is temporarily occupying the DONOR's body, we will henceforth
refer to him as O.D. STU.)


INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

O.D. STU comes racing around a corridor. His LAB COAT is already covered
with gore, and he's having trouble holding his GUTS in. His PANCREAS
spills out onto the floor just as two DOCTORS stroll past.

                           DOCTOR
                 (eyeing the pancreas)
            Might have someone take a look at that.

                        O.D. STU
            Oh. Yeah. Thanks.

The DOCTORS move on. O.D. STU spots a JANITOR'S CART with a roll of DUCT
TAPE on one shelf. He WRAPS IT TIGHTLY around his midsection to keep his
innards from falling out. Then he runs for it.

Now the TEAM OF SURGEONS rounds the corner in hot pursuit. The lead
SURGEON spots O.D. STU at the end of the corridor and takes off after
him. But he SLIPS on the PANCREAS and goes sprawling!

The pancreas goes flying down the hall, where it gets SQUASHED in rapid
succession by a GURNEY and by a little old lady's MOTORIZED WHEELCHAIR.
When the SURGEONS retrieve it, it's a hunk of pulp.

                           LEAD SURGEON
            I think it can still be saved. Put it on ice.

EXT. ZOO - DAY

GUESTS are beginning to arrive for the benefit. In the cages and
habitats, animals stare up at a gigantic MONKEYBONE BALLOON.

EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

The BAZOOM TOY REP is rounding a corner when HERB pops out from behind a
tree and BLASTS HIM with a jolt of purple gas from a Monkeybone doll! He
sputters and coughs...

Then he grabs the doll away and blasts HERB right back! The two of them
chase each other around the tree, giggling. The BAZOOM REP'S WIFE, in
her formal gown, affects a look of supreme mortification.

EXT. STU'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

O.D. STU climbs over the fence, finds a hidden key, and lets himself in.

INT. HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

O.D. STU rushes frantically from room to room.

                           O.D. STU (o.s.)
            DOC? DOC?? - JULIE?

No reply - the joint's empty. O.D. STU enters the studio and spots a
NEWSPAPER on his drafting table. The paper is folded back to a big
DISPLAY AD for the benefit: "MEET STU MILEY AND MONKEYBONE - 8 PM
TONIGHT!" He checks the wall clock: time is short.

Reaching into the drawer of the drafting table, he pulls out a TACKLE
BOX which contains old brushes...and a small VELVET BOX. O.D. STU opens
the velvet box to reveal Grandma's ANTIQUE RING.

He hears GROWLING behind him - it's BUSTER. The dog looks up, cocks his
head - and begins WAGGING HIS TAIL. Somehow, even though STU's in a
different body, BUSTER recognizes him.

EXT. STU AND JULIE'S HOUSE - DAY

O.D. STU exits, ring in hand. Behind him, BUSTER is throwing a fit -
barking, FLINGING himself at the screen door. He wants to come along!

A BUS pulls up at the corner, and O.D. STU boards it. BUSTER throws
everything he's got at the door - and it gives! He takes off after STU.

EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY

As HERB is walking toward the refreshment table, an ODD LOOK crosses his
face. All at once he begins to TUG at his collar. He yanks his TIE off
...doffs his JACKET onto the pavement...

POV HERB - PSYCHO-VISION

The nightmare drug is kicking in! The whole zoo SWIMS around him. All at
once he's being ATTACKED...by a HORDE of EMPTY CLOTHES!!

EXT. ZOO - GROUNDS - DAY

JULIE has arrived at the zoo. She's wandering zombie-like through the
food court, flanked by her friends ALICE and CLARISSA.

                           JULIE
            Whatever he's done, I'm responsible for it.

                           CLARISSA
            That's not true, Julie. It's not true.

                           ALICE
            This is not about your guilt, Julie. There could
            be innocent people in danger.

                           CLARISSA
            He's not the same guy. He's not your Stu.
                 (beat)
            I didn't want to tell you this, but the other
            day he pinched me on the butt.

                           ALICE
            I didn't want to tell you this, but the other
            day he tried to mount me from behind! Look, you
            have to tell the police.

                           JULIE
            Tell them what? I don't know anything concrete.
            All I have is a feeling.

All of a sudden, they hear SHOUTS and LAUGHTER from the area of the
reptile house. In the distance, ZOO SECURITY GUARDS are chasing a NAKED
MAN through the crowds of formally-dressed partygoers.

                           CLARISSA
            Oh my God, we've got a flasher.

                           JULIE
            That...that's Herb!

The GUARDS catch hold of HERB and drag him away past JULIE, ALICE, and
CLARISSA. He doesn't recognize any of them. He's PSYCHOTIC:

                           HERB
            CLOTHES! Beware of clothes. They're working
            together. All of them. Shirts...pants...
            ENSEMBLES...!

The three women exchange looks of stupefied HORROR.

INT. MUNI BUS - LATE AFTERNOON

PASSENGERS are holding their noses, frantically pulling on the BELL ROPE
to alert the driver that they want off. As we move toward the back we
see O.D. STU sitting alone, with rows of empty seats on either side.

He looks rough. He's bone-white, his taped-up lab coat is crusted with
blood, and he never did find any shoes. Also, it's a hot night and he's
starting to get a little ripe. FLIES are buzzing all around him.

EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT

BUSTER runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will
carry him, in pursuit of the BUS.

INT. CAR - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

The team of SURGEONS has been tracking O.D. STU across the city! Through
the windshield they see the BUS pulling up outside the zoo. O.D. STU
hops out and sprints across the parking lot.

                           SURGEON
            IT'S HIM! HE'S GETTING OFF!

INT. ZOO - ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

O.D. STU doesn't even stop at the ticket window. He VAULTS over the
turnstile, knocking benefit guests aside. The SURGEONS aren't far
behind. They race up to the ticket window -

                           SURGEON
            Did you see a corpse running this way?

The TICKET-TAKER shrugs and points off in O.D. STU's direction.

INT. BANQUET TENT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

The last stages of dinner. WAITERS are already clearing plates, and
although JULIE has barely touched her food she sends her plate away.

Onstage a BAND is playing tasteful zoo jazz. When the number ends, STU-
BONE approaches the dais and leans into the mike.

                           STU-BONE
            As emcee I want to thank you all for joining us
            at this swingin' bash...it's a special night for
            the birds, and the lions, and the monkeys, but
            it's also a special night for -
                 (tapping his chest)
            - this monkey. And it's special because of a
            very special lady. Her name is -
                 (checking a note in his pocket)
            Julie McElroy. Just kiddin', Julie. Stand up.

JULIE stands reluctantly. The CROWD APPLAUDS.

                           STU-BONE
            And to make this special night extra-special,
            I'd like to do a special number...especially for
            you.

A DISCO BALL lowers. STU-BONE turns to welcome a group of BACKUP SOUL
SINGERS who are just joining the band on stage.

The TENT begins to ROCK with a throbbing beat. And STU-BONE launches
into a wild-eyed, hip-shaking parody of Mick Jagger singing the Rolling
Stones' "MONKEY MAN"!

As he sings, STU-BONE gyrates over toward JULIE, bumping and grinding
like the cartoon-monkey sex machine he is. He waves his mike to the
crowd, urging everyone to join in. JULIE gasps in disbelief, but the
crowd is eating it up - clapping and singing along with STU-BONE.

He gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor. He opens his
shirt at the neck, exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair.

He pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd. He
wipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd. He
blows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd.

Then he JUMPS UP ON THE TABLES and shakes his booty wildly,­ strutting in
and out among the dessert plates. If the real Jagger could see him, he
would creep home a sad and broken man.

For the big finale, he jumps off the table and SLIDES ACROSS THE FLOOR
to JULIE'S table - arriving ON HIS KNEES.

                           STU-BONE
            I am just a Monkey Man! I'm glad you are a
            monkey...woman...too.
                 (soft voice)

            How about it, Julie?

He pulls out a RING BOX and hands it to the beet-red JULIE. The crowd
lets out a collective GASP - followed by WILD APPLAUSE.

She stares down at the ring - a big vulgar sparkler. She can't speak.

                           STU-BONE
            We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony.
            An Abba Dabba honeymoon!

                           JULIE
            It looks so...new.

                           STU-BONE
            It is new. Why wouldn't it be new?

                           JULIE
            But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's
            ring...

                           STU-BONE
            Heirloom? Huh? You want a used ring - ?

No reply. She's taking a long time to say yes. The audience is
muttering.

                           STU-BONE
            Ju-leeee... Operators are standing by... Offer
            expires at midnight, December 31...

Suddenly a GORE-STAINED FIGURE bursts into the tent.

                           O.D. STU
            DOC! DOC! DON'T DO IT! HE ISN'T STU! HE'S
            MONKEYBONE!!!

JULIE's jaw drops. She barely gets a glimpse of O.D. STU before the ZOO
GUARDS arrive to haul him away.

                           STU-BONE
            Boy, the nuts are out tonight. What'd that creep
            call you - ?

                           JULIE
            He called me "Doc."

- which STU-BONE never does. Someone in the crowd yells...

                           GUEST
            HEY MONKEYBONE!!

STU-BONE turns and does a simian COMEDY SHTICK for the crowd.

                           STU-BONE
            That's me, folks! Monkeybone! Let's party!

By the time he's done scratching his ribs, JULIE has vanished!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

She races out of the tent - grabs a passing ZOO GUARD.

                           JULIE
            Please. Where did you take that man...?

The GUARD points to an ANIMAL CONTROL VAN. JULIE sees O.D. STU peering
out through a small barred panel. Their eyes meet...

                           JULIE
            Who are you? Why did you say those things?

                           O.D. STU
            Oh, Doc, it's all a mixup. We were in the land
            of death. He stole my e-ticket. That's how he
            got my body, see? All they had left for me was
            this corpse!

JULIE digests this, nods professionally, and turns to walk away.

                           O.D. STU
            Don't walk away, Doc! He's only here to give
            people nightmares!
                 (no response)

            Doc! Please! Don't you remember the dream? They
            were pulling the plug - I called out to you -
            and you heard me. Remember?

This stops JULIE cold. Her spine is tingling. She turns slowly, a single
tear rolling down her cheek. And then...

                           JULIE
            BUSTER?!?

The dog runs right past JULIE and bounds up to the animal control van,
barking his head off. Now JULIE is starting to believe. She turns -

                           JULIE
            Stu...how?

                           O.D. STU
            I had to come back, Julie. I had to give you
            this.

THROUGH THE BARS he hands her the little box containing Grandma's
antique ring.

                           O.D. STU
            I meant to give it to you before. The night we
            crashed. I was so happy, Julie, I...try to
            remember me like that, okay? Not like this.

She slips the ring on her finger - looks up at O.D. STU with TEARS
WELLING in her eyes. He makes an odd SNORKELING kind of noise.

                           JULIE
            What's wrong?

                           O.D. STU
            I'm crying too. I just don't have any tears. I'm
            all dried up.

JULIE TURNS. The two DETECTIVES we saw in the sleep lab have just
arrived at the gate, and ALICE and CLARISSA are leading them over.

                           ALICE
            Detective, please let this man out of the van.

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - PIÑATA AREA - THAT MOMENT

The PARTYGOERS are lined up under the gigantic Stanley-shaped PIÑATA,
which is hanging from a tree. A TUBBY BANKER in a blindfold takes a good
hard whack. CRACKS are beginning to appear...

                           STU-BONE
            Okay, folks, it's piñata time - you know the
            rules - five bucks a pop - and remember, it's
            all for the benefit of our friends the animals!
                 (eyes brightening)
            Oooooh! This one's on me!

The next contestant is a GORGEOUS WOMAN. He blindfolds her and embraces
her from behind to help her with her grip on the bat.

                           STU-BONE
            Choke up, baby. That's right. Choke up!

Suddenly he notices the COPS marching up with JULIE, O.D. STU and co. in
tow. He freezes, terrified - BACKS AWAY from the BABE -

- and catches a BAT IN THE FACE. Several people rush up to help him as
the COPS consult with the BENEFIT ORGANIZERS...

                           ORGANIZER
            I don't understand, officer. This is a benefit.
            Surely this can wait until -

                           COP
            Sorry, ma'am...we need to question Mr. Miley on
            a most urgent matter.

                           JULIE
            Stop this. Now. Those dolls have been tampered
            with. They're toxic!

O.D. STU comes marching through the crowd. He passes a LIFE-SIZED
DISPLAY of Stanley and Monkeybone...GRABS THE BACKPACK off the Stanley
figure...and proceeds deliberately toward STU-BONE.

                           O.D. STU
            MONKEYBONE...BACK IN THE PACK.

The old command seems to retain its magical power, because STU-BONE
clutches his gut as if stricken at the sound of it.

                           O.D. STU
            I mean it this time. Back in the pack.

STU-BONE bends over - jerks and twitches - becoming more SIMIAN by the
moment as O.D. STU approaches.

                           STU-BONE
            Stu...I can explain...I was sick of being a
            figment, see? It's awful being a figment. It's
            degrading! And I never really wanted to give
            people nightmares. I just told 'em that so
            they'd help me get a body.

                           O.D. STU
            Yeah - my body. Back in the pack, you simian
            shitbird!

The COPS are tres confused by all this -

                           COP
            Ma'am, can you give me some idea of what's going
            on here?

- but JULIE holds them back so the scene can play itself out. Now STU-
BONE is doing a weird little monkey dance - PLAYING UP to the puzzled
crowd, who laugh and snicker, wondering what to make of all this.

                           STU-BONE
            Laugh, damn you...laugh at the sidekick...the
            happy little monkey. He doesn't have any
            feelings. He's just a figment of your
            immagination!

He turns suddenly - GRABS THE BAT from the puzzled BABE -

                           STU-BONE
            GIMME THAT GODDAM BAT!

He wails on the piñata like Ken Griffey Jr. O.D. STU tries to stop him,
but it's too late - the piñata BURSTS, and hundreds of PURPLE-ASSED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS spill out onto the ground!

An equal number of RABID PARTYGOERS surge forward to scoop them up. The
COPS swing into action, trying to hold the crowd back...

                           COP
            HE'S GETTING AWAY!

STU-BONE climbs a tree and JUMPS from a branch onto one of the TWIN
JUNGLE TOWERS at the pavilion - begins CLIMBING toward the giant
MONKEYBONE BALLOON moored up above!

O.D. STU sees him - pulls away from JULIE -

                           O.D. STU
            I LOVE YOU!

                           JULIE
            STU!!

STU-BONE unties the mooring rope and wraps it around his midsection. Now
freed, the balloon LIFTS INTO THE AIR, CARRYING HIM ALOFT!

O.D. STU climbs up the opposite tower as the balloon starts to drift
away. He GRABS HOLD of the MOORING ROPE as it whips past.

And the TEAM OF SURGEONS - who have been combing the grounds in search
of O.D. STU - catch sight of him just as he FLOATS OFF INTO THE AIR, ON
THE END OF THE ROPE!

                           HEAD SURGEON
            LOOK! IT'S HIM!


EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - ON BALLOON - MOVING

They rise to an altitude of ten or twelve feet. But O.D. STU's
additional weight pulls the balloon back DOWN - and both of them hit the
ground! They have to RUN at top speed just to keep pace with the
balloon!

                           STU-BONE
            Let...go...you...dingleberry...

As he's trying to KICK O.D. STU off the rope, a GUST OF WIND catches the
balloon and LIFTS IT HIGH INTO THE AIR.

For about three seconds. The boys tumble to earth, off-balance, in a
heap, BOUNCING along the pavement. The balloon pulls them over a
WROUGHT-IRON FENCE and drags them through the ALLIGATOR PIT. Giant jaws
snap as the boys glide overhead like bait on a hook.

As the balloon LIFTS UP AGAIN, O.D. STU hauls himself along the length
of the rope.

He gets close enough to GRAB STU-BONE's LEG. STU-BONE reaches down to
push him away...grabs a fistful of DUCT TAPE...

...and RIP! The tape TEARS - exposing the great big GASH in O.D. STU's
midsection! He tries to pull himself together...

EXT. FOOD COURT - THAT MOMENT - LATE AFTERNOON

A SERVER ladles out a cup of PUNCH from a big silver PUNCHBOWL.
Something PINK comes plummeting out of the sky - and the next thing he
knows, the SERVER is DRENCHED!

The SURGEONS come rushing up. They all stick their hands in the
punchbowl at once...fishing out O.D. STU'S KIDNEY!

                           HEAD SURGEON
            Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved!

One of the TEAM finds an ice cooler full of soft drinks. In it goes.

EXT. TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

BOTH BOYS SCREAM as the balloon drags them perilously close to the RAZOR
WIRE atop a tall storm fence.

They clear it by inches - but they don't have much time to celebrate.
They're dangling over the Bengal Tiger exhibit, and the great cats are
LEAPING INTO THE AIR trying to snag them!

As O.D. STU squirms out of reach, his LIVER drops out...

EXT. GROUNDS - TIGER HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

It lands close enough to the FENCE that one of the SURGEONS thinks he
can reach it. He reaches through the bars and sees a pack of BENGAL
TIGERS racing toward him! He manages to grab ONE END of the liver - but
a TIGER gets the other end -

- and it's a TUG-OF-WAR until the tiger BITES the liver in half, sending
the terrified SURGEON sprawling on the pavement outside the bars! The
HEAD SURGEON examines the remaining half-liver...

                           HEAD SURGEON
            Put it on ice. I think it can still be saved.

ANGLE ON BALLOON

STU-BONE socks O.D. STU hard across the face! He lets go of his incision
...and his SMALL INTESTINE falls out! Since it's still connected at both
ends, the intestine forms a great big LOOP...

EXT. FOOD COURT - SERVING TABLE - LATE AFTERNOON

The SERVER has just brought out a new PUNCHBOWL full of nice clean
punch. He sets it down on the table and is about to ladle out a cupful
when STU flies past overhead. His intestinal LOOP slides across the
table, knocking over glasses, snagging the PUNCHBOWL at its base...

...and YANKING IT right off the table! Bystanding GUESTS are DRENCHED in
punch as the punch bowl FLIES END OVER END...

...and, with the sound of a GONG being struck, BEANS a member of the
SURGICAL TEAM from behind!! Naturally it's the guy who's lugging the ICE
CHEST full of O.D. STU's organs. When the punchbowl strikes, he GOES
DOWN HARD, PITCHING the ice chest...

... at a pair of COPS who are over by the piñata, loading CONFISCATED
MONKEYBONE DOLLS into a SHOPPING CART. The ICE CHEST knocks them off
their feet - and sends the SHOPPING CART rolling downhill!

The COPS try to get up, but they skid every which way on the SPILLED ICE
underneath. On top of which, the SURGICAL TEAM is all over them, playing
GRAB-ASS with the COPS as they try to retrieve precious organs.

The HEAD SURGEON kneels beside his fallen comrade, the guy who got
BEANED by the punchbowl, and feels for a pulse.

                           HEAD SURGEON
            Put him on ice. I think he can still be saved!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

COPS sprint downhill, trying to intercept the runaway SHOPPING CART full
of confiscated dolls. Too late. The CART slams into a fence and goes
ass-over-teakettle, dumping its contents into the PENGUIN HABITAT...

INT. HYP'S HIDEAWAY - THAT MOMENT

HYPNOS and an audience of DARKTOWNERS peer into the nightmare orb. They
see a Keystone-Cops vision of fur-clad ESKIMOS, with clubs and
spearguns, amid a colony of terrified PENGUINS.

                           HYPNOS
            Not again. THAT STINKING MONKEY!!!

AERIAL SHOT - STU'S POV - MOVING

STU gets an idea as he looks down at his dangling INTESTINE. He begins
FEEDING IT OUT - giving himself more rope to work with - and when it's
long enough, begins SWINGING IT like a LASSO!

EXT. WATER BUFFALO HABITAT - LATE AFTERNOON

WATER BUFFALO graze Buddha-like as STU'S INTESTINE snags one of them
around the HORNS. The lasso draws taut - and holds!

ANGLE ON BALLOON - O.D. STU AND STU-BONE

The balloon is moored in place again! O.D. STU pulls himself upward,
toward STU-BONE, who KICKS AT him frantically!

EXT. ZOO GROUNDS - LATE AFTERNOON

A COP pulls his sidearm and TAKES AIM at the now-stabilized balloon.

                           COP
            I think I can bring 'em down.

ANGLE ON BALLOON - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

BLAM! The cop's shot hits the giant MONKEYBONE BALLOON smack in the ass.
With a gale-force helium FART, the balloon ZOOMS UPWARD. The INTESTINE
snaps. STU-BONE and O.D. STU shoot off into the air!


ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - AERIAL

AT APOGEE. They exchange a LOOK as the last gasp of helium hisses out of
the gigantic balloon. Then it occurs to them to look DOWN...

THEIR POV - PARKING LOT - OVERHEAD ANGLE

...at the tiny CARS parked far, far below. They must be close to a
hundred feet up in the air - and all at once the ground is coming up
fast!

EXT. ZOO - ON JULIE & CROWD - LATE AFTERNOON

JULIE et al SCREAM IN HORROR as the two bodies plunge earthward.


ON STU-BONE & O.D. STU - FALLING

...and falling and falling until they SMACK INTO the hot asphalt of the
parking lot, the deflated balloon settling over them like a shroud.

Their BODIES have stopped - but their SPIRITS keep on falling...

AERIAL SHOT - SKIES OVER DARK TOWN - NIGHT

...and the fight continues - even into the afterlife! As they plummet
down through the heavens, they REVERT to their true personae. It's STU
vs. MONKEYBONE, creator vs. sidekick, still duking it out - like a
couple of skydivers fighting over a single parachute!

EXT. STREETS - DARK TOWN - RIGHT

DARKTOWNERS pour into the streets to watch the epic struggle overhead.
They're placing bets, rooting their favorites on. Then...

THE GROUND SHAKES AND THUNDERS - and the DARKTOWNERS scatter in all
directions, DIVING for the nearest hiding place. They seem to know what
this mighty rumbing signifies.

The E-TICKET RIDE pops out of the ground - begins to RISE into the air -
and a COLOSSUS appears beneath it! A FIFTY-FOOT WARRIOR clad in JAPANESE
CEREMONIAL ARMOR, he TOWERS over Dark Town, so mighty and enormous that
he can wear the E-TICKET RIDE as a hat!!

ON STU AND MONKEYBONE - FALLING

STU lands a HAYMAKER, and the two of them break loose of each other -


ON ARMORED COLOSSUS - THAT MOMENT

- LANDING in the upturned palms of the COLOSSUS! STU watches in
disbelief as a PANEL pops open in the giant's CHEST, revealing...

                           STU
            DEATH!!

                           DEATH
            I dress up when I want to make an impression. -
            So how'd it go?

                           STU
            Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye,
            everything's gonna be okay.
                 (shrugging)
            I guess I'm yours now.

                           MONKEYBONE
            Death, I'd like to point out that none of this
            was my fault. The roots of this tragedy go back
            to a callous, uncaring society that -

DEATH lets out a MIGHTY ROAR and CLAPS HIS GREAT METAL HANDS together.
Man and monkey are surely squished. But when DEATH opens his hands, STU
is still there, cupped safely in his palms.

                           STU
            Hey. Where's Monkeybone?

                           DEATH
            Back in your head, where he belongs.
                 (beat)
            No offense, Stu, but on your own you're kinda
            vanilla. I didn't want to send you back without
            him.

                           STU
            Back? You're sending me back?

                           DEATH
            It's irregular, but...I just love that strip of
            yours. I figure I'll take the "Family Circus"
            guy instead.

                           STU
            Death! Thank you!

                           DEATH
            Thank me next time you see me.

He sends STU ROCKETING UPWARD INTO THE STRATOSPHERE with a single flick
of his finger. Then he turns...

                           DEATH
            Ohhhh, Hypnos??

A BUNCH OF FRIGHTENED DARKTOWNERS pitch the quivering satyr out into the
middle of the town square.

                           HYPNOS
            Death! So nice to see you. I can explain -

He looks up tremulously. A GIANT SHADOW falls across him...followed by a
GIANT ARMORED FOOT.

EXT. ZOO - DUSK

JULIE SOBS in a POLICEMAN's arms at the exit to the zoo.

                           JULIE
            I don't know what happened. All I know is...he
            was in a coma...and then he came back...and now
            he's gone again.

They wander out. Behind them, a squad of COPS are confiscating
MONKEYBONE DOLLS from squawling children as they file out.


EXT. ZOO - PARKING LOT - DUSK

The TWO CORPSES, on gurneys, are being loaded into the back of the
police ambulance. The SURGEON and his team come wandering up.

                           SURGEON
            Excuse me. We lost a corpse - we saw him heading
            this way...

                           DRIVER
            I got a couple of fresh ones in the back. Help
            yourself.

The SURGEON pulls the sheet off CORPSE #1 - aka O.D. STU.

                           SURGEON
            I'll be. It's him all right. Still dead...

The SECOND CORPSE sits up abruptly. His sheet falls away, revealing STU
...the real STU...now back in his own body! The SURGEON and his TEAM run
away from the ambulance SHRIEKING.

EXT. ZOO - ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK

BUSTER barks like a maniac. JULIE turns and sees an IMPOSSIBLE VISION
ambling toward her...STU, alive and kicking. She can't believe it's him
until he grabs her and pulls her close.

                           JULIE
            Is it you? Is it really you this time?

He pulls her close and kisses her long and hard, quelling all doubts.

                           JULIE
            Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.

                           STU
            Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.

They wander off, arm in arm. STU TUGS at the seat of his pants.

                           JULIE
            What's the matter?

                           STU
            My tail itches.

He DOES A TAKE as he realizes what he's just said - but JULIE smiles,
and he shrugs it off. Johnny Mercer's "DREAM" comes up underneath as the
reunited lovers walk off into the moonlight, and we

                                                   FADE OUT.

          INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

          ALICE PERRY (30s), her innate and amiable authority eclipsed
          only by a self-consciousness about her hair, afraid perhaps
          that she hasn't lived up to the promise of its red color,
          chalks "Futur Anterieur" in precise cursive at the board.

                         ALICE
          "By tomorrow, we will have flown to
          France."
          She turns to face her TENTH GRADE FRENCH CLASS.
          Though Alice's make up, earrings and practical flats are
          simple, there is an inherent elegance to their combination
          that hints at a more complex, if uncharted, interior.

                          ALICE (CONT'D)
           Who can give me an example? Paul?
           NOTE: Throughout, all blocks of italicized dialogue should be

                         
          read as in FRENCH with ENGLISH subtitles.

                         PAUL
          "I will have completed the assigned
          translation by the end of
          vacation."

          C'est bon! Amber?

                         AMBER
          I will have failed French again by
          the end of the year.
          Alice pauses, regarding Amber with a pained sympathy.

          En francais si'l vows plait?

          calculus formula at the board while all of her TWELFTH GRADE
          MALE STUDENTS avidly admire her shape in a tight, stylish
          skirt and heels. She turns suddenly, smiling brightly.

          Okay! Kyle?
          KYLE snaps his eyes up to Emma's face, tries to cover.

                         KYLE
          Um... I guess I'm a little lost.
          If optimists see a glass as half full, Emma's is in a
          constant state of cheerful, blonde overflow, even when a
          level of wilfulness is required.

                         EMMA
          Try to follow along. I really want

          TWO GIRLS ( 17) laugh conspiratorially, dredging woven pot
          holders through an egg mixture and dropping them into a
          sputtering pan, as the rest of the CLASS makes French toast.
          The girls sneak looks at MEG KELLY (30's) who tears recipes
          from a Gourmet magazine at her desk at the front of the room.
          Dark hair pulled into a pony tail, face unadorned by makeup,
          Meg's natural sexiness is muted by an air of indifference.
          She glances up when the pan erupts in flames and the girls
          leap back with a shriek, shakes her head.
          The girls attempt to knock the pan from the burner with the
          handle of a broom when a pot lid bangs down, instantly
          snuffing the flames.
          They shrink back as Meg waves the lid, clearing the smoke.

          EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

          Alice, a heavy bag slung over her shoulder, and her boyfriend
          RICHARD (30's, scruffily handsome in sweats and a coach's
          jersey), carrying three binders and a bag of baseball bats,

          Richard hands over the binders with a kiss.

                         RICHARD
          Got practice until five thirty,
          then I'll be by.

                         ALICE
          I'll see you then. Thanks.
          They kiss again and Richard takes off for the athletic
          fields, passing Meg as she comes from the school, waves.

                          RICHARD
          Hey, Meg! Bon voyage!
          Alice offers a binder to Meg as she arrives at Alice's car.

                         ALICE
          I finished our travel binders!
          Meg takes the binder, looks it over.

          Richard, come on. You're leaving?

                         RICHARD
          (without looking back)
          Maybe I'll see you in a week.
          Alice listens to his footfalls and the slam of the front
          door, then falls back on the bed, striking her head on the
          open suitcase, wincing.

                         ALICE

                         (MISERABLE)
          I'm sorry...

          Ladies and Gentleman, we are about
          to begin our descent into Charles

          INT. AIRPLANE - IN FLIGHT - DAY

          Meg sleeps in an aisle seat of the dim coach cabin where all
          the window shades have been drawn down, Emma dozing beside
          her, a game of cards laid out on her tray table.

                         
          Alice brings her seat to the upright position as instructed
          and sits, hyper-alert, looking at her closed window shade.
          A beat.
          She reaches out and raises the shade a tentative crack,
          flooding their row with light.
          She glances furtively around the cabin, then inches the shade
          higher, drawing in a sharp breath at what she sees.
          She flings the shade up.
          ALL OF PARIS is laid out below her; a magical nautilus-like
          wheel with the Eiffel Tower as its central axle.
          Her breath steams the window as she drinks it all in.
          She turns, eyes full, to Meg who cranes across Emma to share
          in the view and squeeze Alice's arm with a smile.

                         EMMA
          Are we there?!

          A CUSTOMS AGENT stamps Alice's passport with a thump.

          Bien venue.
          Alice looks up from her imprinted passport, smiles hugely.

                         ALICE
          Merci .

          EXT. CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT - DAY

          Alice emerges with Meg and Emma, each struggling with their
          luggage, onto the thronged arrivals deck.

                         EMMA
          There it is! Esprit de Corps!
          Alice looks to where Emma points, seeing a small sky-blue
          flag at the end of a long staff held by MADAME VALERY (40s,
          pinched) their harried tour guide in a suit of the same blue.

                         ALICE
          Excuse me, are you Madame Valery?

                         0
          Madame Valery glances up from her clipboard beside their bus.

          EXT. PARIS - DAY

          The battered Esprits de Corps Tours bus careens through the
          streets, listing wildly from side to side.

          Alice, squashed beside Meg on the over-crowded bus, whips her
          head up from her guidebook.

          MADAME VALERY (CONT'D)
          Was the Arc de Triomphe.

          Hey, Alice! Meg!
           Alice and Meg turn to Emma across the aisle, who hooks a
          thumb at CARL and DEEDEE (late 60's, both stout) beside her.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Can you believe? They're from St.
          Paul! On their honeymoon!

          The bus hurtles around the drive, screeching to a halt,
          bouncing roughly on its shocks at the museum's entrance.

           INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Alice, Meg and Emma race past gallery after gallery, trying
          to keep Madame Valery's little blue flag in sight as it flies
          over the crowd in the distance.
          Alice whipsaws her head at everything they're missing, making
          notes in her guidebook on the fly.

                         ALICE
          Try to remember that! We'll double
          back for the Chagalls!

          INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads the charge up the right wing of the Daru
          staircase, past the statue of Winged Victory.
          Alice stops Meg and Emma in front of the statue, while Carl
          and Deedee try to catch their breath on the landing.

          They head for the right stairs just as Madam Valery
          reappears, descending with her group on the left.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          Oh.
          Alice turns Meg and Emma around to come back down.

                         DEEDEE
          Well, that saved us a climb.

          INT. LOUVRE - DAY

          Emma elbows her way out of a crush of raised cameras and
          cellphones to Alice and Meg who strain at the rear of the
          CROWD to view a painting, all but the top of its gold frame
          obscured.

          Meg and Emma sit hunched over Emma's camera and its shaky,
          digital image of the Mona Lisa, squeezed in with Alice and
          the rest of their tour at too few tables.

                         EMMA
          Alice, I'll e-mail it to you.
          Meg looks up, catching Alice eyeing their surroundings.

          At least she's smiling.

          What? No. I'm--. I'm just a

          We'll probably all get it!
          Meg raises a glass of wine.

                         MEG
          To jet lag.
          Emma and Alice raise their glasses to toast as WAITERS plunk
          down identical plates of steak frites before them.

          They clink glasses and Alice is suddenly jostled, just as
          she's about to sip, by Carl as he turns from the table behind
          her, spilling her wine.

          If you're not using it.
          As Emma passes the bottle of catsup, Meg offers Alice her
          napkin, and waiters sweep their plates away, replacing them
          with creme brulees.

                         ALICE

          Esprit de Corps tour members disembark from their bus in
          front of a comically narrow and vertical Baroque hotel with
          its name in feeble buzzing neon: Le Petit Sommeil.

                         ALICE (PRE-LAP)
          Look! Look at this picture and
          tell me what's different!

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          The women lower the travel brochure and its photograph of a
          tidy well-appointed suite, to regard the actual one in which
          they stand; dingy, impossibly small, crowded by an armoire
          that nearly meets the low sloping ceiling, with two spindly
          twin beds and a military-style cot.

                         EMMA
          Toujour le suck-ez vous.

          Okay, Emma. Let's just unpack--
          she turns for the luggage, nearly falling over at the weight
          of Emma's suitcase as she reaches to lift it.

          Holy--! Alice, help--

          Just the stuff you put on my list--
          (off her look)
          And a couple options.
          The bag slips from Meg's grasp, crashing onto the foot of the
          bed which collapses, catapulting Alice onto the cot which
          flips up over her, knocking Emma into the tiny bathroom.

          INT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - NIGHT

          Alice gazes out a window that opens onto a narrow alley and
          the ugly backsides of buildings, as Meg and Emma sleep
          fitfully behind her.
          She looks down at the cellphone in her hands, scrolling
          through her speed dial to stop at: 1. Richard.
          She hesitates with her thumb over the "call" button.
          She turns back to the miserable view, considering for a beat,
          then folds her phone away as she blinks back tears.

          EXT. PONT DES ARTS BRIDGE - DAY

          Madame Valery leads a diminished flock, bobbing her staff
          with its blue flag, in a forced march across the span of the
          ornate pedestrian bridge toward the waiting tour bus.

          because the Louvre was formally
          known as the Palais des Arts...
          Madame Valery stops ahead, turning back to take in Alice and
          her cluster of appreciative followers.

                         MADAME VALERY
          People! We must keep together!

          EXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL -- DAY

          Alice's group circles an inscribed stone medallion with a
          star-shaped brass inset on the pavement outside Notre Dame.

                         

                         DEEDEE
          "Point zero. Dez roots dee France."

                         ALICE
          It's from right here that all the
          highway miles in all of France are
          measured. They also say that if
          you stand on this exact spot, you
          are be destined to return to France
          in the future.

                         MEG
          Oh, I'm in! Come on. Everyone!
          Together, they all step forward, arms entwined, laughing.

                         EMMA
          I want a picture! Of all of us!
          Alice looks up as Emma breaks away, to see Madam Valery
          leading her dwindling group from the great church.
          Madame Valery sends her charges to the bus, then heads
          straight for Alice as Emma tries to enlist a JAPANESE COUPLE
          to take a group photo with her camera.

          My head count was short in the
          cathedral.

          I'm sorry. I was explaining about

                         POINT ZERO--
          Madame Valery sizes Alice up and taps her staff as the group
          forms around them, joined by the Japanese couple.

                         MADAME VALERY
          This flag? I do not carry it for
          my pleasure.

                         ALICE
          We were just on our way inside--

                         MADAME VALERY
          Well, now you may head to the bus.

                         ALICE
          But, we haven't been--

                         MADAME VALERY
          Which is why you must follow my

          okay. We will. I promise. But,
          these people haven't seen the

                         MADAME VALERY
          There are many churches on the
          tour.

                         ALICE
          But, this is Notre Dame! They need
          to see this--

          I assure you, they will see

          Well, what's the point if it's all

          You seem quite the Paris expert,
          for someone who has never been.

                         EMMA
          Ill bet she knows more about it
          than you!
          The Japanese wife frames the action with Emma's camera.

                         ALICE
          I might not have ever been here
          before, but...

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          I've waited my whole life for this

          We've waited thirty years--

          You tell her, Carl.

                         ALICE
          You keep rushing us through, like
          this is some kind of race--

                         (REALLY HURT)
          And you won't even speak French
          with me.

                         (SGUARES HERSELF)
          Now, I think I've been very nice.
          We're from Wisconsin. But, I'm
          telling you, I am not getting on
          that bus until my friends and I
          have seen Notre Dame.
          Meg and Emma exchange looks as Alice plants herself with
          folded arms and steely resolve before Madame Valery.

                         MADAME VALERY
          Perhaps, if Madame is not satisfied
          with my tour she could conduct her
          own.

                         EMMA
          What'd she say?
          Alice's eyes narrow in regarding Madame Valery and all fall
          silent a beat; a crowd anticipating fireworks.
          CLICK! The Japanese wife snaps a picture of the standoff,
           the sound of the shutter triggering Alice to action.

          Whoa!
          Madame Valery, nonplussed, reaches out to reclaim her flag,
          but Alice jerks it further away, while the Japanese woman
          snaps picture after picture.

          Carl, we're getting on the bus!
          Madame Valery lunges for the stick.

          EXT. NOTRE DAME CATHEDRAL - DAY

          The bus pulls away, revealing the Japanese couple who return
          Emma's camera with a bow, Meg, and Alice holding the flag.

                         EMMA
          That was fantastic!

          Alice brings the staff down across her knee, snapping it in
          two, casting the broken ends into the gutter as she raises
          herself to her full height.

                         ALICE
          Now, the real tour can begin!

          Alice marches forward as a few drops of rain fall.

          I think it's starting to rain--

          Water pours in sheets from the sky as Alice, Meg and Emma
          splash down the Rue de Rivoli and duck beneath the shelter of
          the hotel's canopy.
          They shake water from their arms and hair, pluck at their
          sopping clothes.

          They glance over at a few PAPARAZZI sharing the protection of
          the overhang on the far side of the entrance, as a camera
          flashes in taking Emma's picture.
          Emma smiles, blinks, confused as another photographer
          admonishes the first.

          You're wasting your film. That's

          Alice looks about in equal confusion, but stops short when
          she sees the opulent restaurant behind the window's glass.

                         ALICE
          Oh.
          Meg and Emma turn to gape as well at the DINERS and elegant
          tables inside as the rain hammers down.

          CORDELIA WINTHROP SCOTT (dressed similarly to Emma, though at

          from enormous glasses as they finish their meals.

                         ALICE
          (draining her glass)
          She should be ashamed. Can you
          imagine having a room here and then
          not staying in it?
          An ANXIOUS WAITER races in, refilling Alice's glass.

                         EMMA

                         (PERFECT MIMIC)
          Darling, I was thinking of ordering
          this entire menu, and then not
          eating it!

                         
          The waiter retreats, joining FIVE others standing at
          discreet, fearful attention, all careful not to look at Emma
          whom they've clearly mistaken her for Cordelia.

                         MEG
          We should just take it. Her room.

                         EMMA
          And her trip to Monte Carlo!

                         (TO ALICE)
          That's still France, right?

                         MEG
          Alice, how fast can you get a
          binder going on a trip like that?

                         ALICE

                         (LAUGHS)
          Oh, I'd love to see that. Us in
          Monte Carlo.

                         MEG
          What's so funny about that? We got
          in here.

          Indeed. It is pitiful how low the
          standards here have fallen.
          Two waiters step in to clear plates, hearing all.

          Alice and Meg laugh with Emma as the waiters head for the
          kitchen in panic.

                         WAITER

                         MANAGER
          Pardon, Mademoiselle Scott?
          The three look up at the manager in surprise.

                         ALICE
          I'm so sorry. Were we being too
          loud?

          No, no, we are all very happy to
          see Mademoiselle Scott smile...
          A WINE STEWARD hustles up to the table with an ice bucket
          stand and a bottle of Champagne.

                         MANAGER (CONT'D)
          Please. In apology for our earlier

          open the bottle and the manager bows, backing away.

          Emma smiles, broadly, batting her eyelashes as the steward
          pops the Champagne cork.

          three drunk laughing women.

                         
          Alice fumbles for a switch, hitting the lights, and their
          laughter cuts abruptly at the sumptuous interior of gleaming
          marble, gilt and silk.

          Alice sees but one the thing: The Eiffel tower illuminated
          on the other side of a bank of French doors.

                         ALICE
          A view! There's a view.
          Alice races to push back the window sheers, revealing a
          staggering panorama of the city, the Seine, and the Eiffel
          tower in the pouring rain.
          The entire city of light is reflected in her eyes.

          Alice enters, steering around a tower of Louis Vuitton
          luggage, as Meg pulls a fresh bottle of Champagne from a
          bucket of ice.

                         ALICE
          Wait. What are you guys doing?
          Emma launches herself onto the enormous bed.

                         EMMA

          Alice considers, looks out the window at the streaming rain.

                         ALICE
          Okay. But, just until it stops
          raining. Then we go.

          Seen from the bed, the light atop the Eiffel tower breaks

          Trip's paid for, whether that girl
          takes it or not.

                         ALICE
          Oh! And somehow that magically
          makes taking it right?

                         EMMA
          What's the worst that could happen?

                         ALICE
          I can think of a lot of things--

                         MEG
          You're in charge. You want to go
          back to that hotel, okay by me.
          A beat while Alice looks between Meg and Emma, trapped.

                         MEG (CONT'D)

                         
          Totally your call.

          And, darling, we'll completely
          understand if you feel we shouldn't
          go.

          The car drives across the wide stretch of runway on a
          trajectory for a waiting private jet.

          INT. PRIVATE JET - IN FLIGHT - DAY

          The women swivel around in their plush seats at the POP! of a
          cork as a STEWARD opens a bottle of Champagne.

                         ALICE
          Okay. We go. We take a look
          around. We get on a train and come

          Now, I like that idea, because it's
          true!
          They fall silent as the steward appears with glasses of
          Champagne, wait for him to retreat.

                         ALICE
          Go, look, come right back. It's a
          good plan.

          EXT. AIRPORT - NICE - DAY

          The steward helps the women from the plane, where another
          UNIFORMED MAN waits on the tarmac to escort them further.

          INT. NICE AIRPORT - DAY

          Their escort opens a door ahead of them to a roof deck, wind
          spilling in to the stairway they climb.

          EXT. NICE AIRPORT - ROOF DECK - DAY

          They emerge onto the deck, Emma squealing and grabbing Alice
          when she sees their waiting helicopter.

          INT./EXT. HELICOPTER - IN FLIGHT - DAY

          Alice, Meg and Emma delight as the helicopter banks along the
          coast, the Mediterranean glittering in blue and green below.
          A craggy ridge falls away and all of MONTE CARLO unfolds in
          step upon step of coral rooftops, cream and gold.

          END MONTAGE.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - DAY

          Alice, Emma and Meg step from a limousine, blinking in the
          bright sunlight to take in the square in front of the hotel,
          its fountain and the adjacent casino.

          Mademoiselle Scott!
          They turn as JEAN-PIERRE MICHAND (late 30's), sophisticated
          in jeans and a sportscoat but with a warm bohemian air, comes
          down the steps, an oversized envelope tucked under his arm.

                         EMMA
          Well, bon jour me.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          You made it! I was getting a

          Forgive me. Jean-Pierre. Michand.
          With the foundation--
          He pauses in shaking Emma's hand as his eyes land on Alice
          with friendly curiosity, a charge.

                         JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
          Welcome--. I---. I didn't realize
          you would be bringing--

          Oh, I'm sorry! This is Alice Perry

          Alice and Meg as he consults his wristwatch.

          We won't keep you--

          I just wanted to make sure you
          arrived safely and that I was here
          to greet you.

                         (AN AFTERTHOUGHT)

          waiting.

          His Highness?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          The Prince. But, we will see each
          other at the casino for tonight's
          game. Please, bring your friends--

          You are very generous, and we'd
          love to, but, I'm afraid Cordelia
          has other plans this evening--
          Jean-Pierre turns, charmed by Alice's perfect French, and
          alarmed by this news.

          Within a glossy brochure: A collage of "snapshots" shows
           happy African children grouped outside their new school;
          raising their hands at their desks in a pristine classroom;
          finding their country on a glossy globe.

          At first glance they look spectacular, but under closer

          dress that is too tight, nearly spilling her breasts, and the
          self-consciousness Alice endures in a dress made daringly
          short by her height.

          I shall certainly try.
          Domenico escorts Emma out onto the casino floor as Jean-
          Pierre touches Alice's elbow.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Shall we?
          Alice and Meg allow Jean-Pierre to lead them, following Emma
          as GAMBLERS break from their games to track these three
          elegant women gliding smoothly through the room.

                         MEG
          (aside to Alice)
          I may as well be topless.

                         ALICE
          Please. I'm mooning everyone
          behind us.

          A DEALER unseals a new deck of cards as Domenico pulls out a
          chair for Emma at the room's enormous game table.

                         EMMA
          Oh, but, I really wasn't planning
          on playing this evening. I so much
          prefer to watch--
          Emma looks to Alice and Meg for help as Jean-Pierre leads
          them to the far side of a low railing to view the game.

                         DOMENICO

                         (A WINK)
          This I do not believe about you.
          He turns to the eight other PLAYERS (of various ages and
          genders, but all rich) clustered at the room's small bar.

                         DOMENICO (CONT'D)
          Ladies and gentlemen? Shall we
          begin?
          The other players make obligatory introductions and take up
          positions at the table as Jean-Pierre offers Alice and Meg
          tall upholstered stools to sit.

          Alice moves to sit, but then remembers her skirt, looks to 
          Meg who is unable to even raise a leg in her tight dress.

                         ALICE

                         (TO JEAN-PIERRE)
          Easier to see if we stand.
          Jean-Pierre hands them both a glass of Champagne.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          And why aren't you playing?

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Ah. I play behind the scenes.
          Like Robin Hood, I take from those
          who have more than enough, for
          those who have nothing but need.

                         (LAUGHS)
          Also, I do not play because I have
          no money of my own.
          Alice smiles, charmed by his candor, but then stops.

                         ALICE
          They're playing for money?
          (turns to Meg, flat)

                         IS
          They're playing for money.
          Together they turn to see Emma happily arranging the cards
          she is dealt in her hands.

                         DOMENICO
          Cordelia, why don't you do us the
          honor of setting this evening's
          stakes?
          Emma glances over to Alice and Meg who look back at her,
          ashen, and turns to the players who smile expectantly.

                         EMMA
          Oh. Um. Okay...
          She takes her handbag into her lap, opens it, looks.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)

                         (A GUESS)
          Alright. Why don't... Why don't
          we start at ten?
          A shocked player sputters into his drink.
          Emma places a twenty Euro note on the table.

          A beat.
          Jean-Pierre, Domenico and all the other players burst out
          laughing and Emma smiles, laughing too, but shoots a
          desperate look to Alice and Meg.

                         DOMENICO
          Marvelous!
          He signals an ATTENDANT over as Emma's shoulders relax.

                         DOMENICO (CONT'D)
          Please bring Mademoiselle Scott a
          rack of chips.

          Um. Sure.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          You would not know it, but she is
          very funny.

                         MEG
          A riot.
          Domenico casts a glossy chip into the pot.

                         DOMENICO
          Mademoiselle Scott starts us at ten
          thousand a hand.
          Alice and Meg freeze, their champagne glasses sliding from
          their hands, while Emma's eyes grow as large as all the
          zeroes on Domenico's chip.

                         DOMENICO (CONT'D)
          You must be feeling very lucky.

          Emma sits locked in a cool stare-down over the top of her 
          cards with Domenico across from her at the tensed table.
          Meg downs a glass of Champagne in one gulp, snagging the back
          of the WAITER's jacket, hauling him back for a refill.
          The waiter turns to Alice, who pats at her face with a damp
          napkin, struggling to breathe.

                         MEG
          (takes bottle from waiter)
          I should probably keep this.

          Emma places her cards face down before her, appears to fold.

          Well...
          She moves her hands to the stacks and stacks of chips beside

          The other players gasp and Alice fails to suppress a whimper
          as she grasps Meg's pouring hand, spilling Champagne, drawing
          Jean-Pierre's attention.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Are you alright?

                         ALICE
          Great. I'm just--. Excuse me.
          Alice slips around the railing and heads for Emma as two
          players fold in near tears, leaving just Emma, Domenico and a
          DOWAGER (60's) in the game.

          Domenico pushes his own mountain of chips to the pot in the
          center of the table and Alice buries her face in her hands
          when the dowager folds her cards.

          Well. It is just a game after all.
          She turns her cards over and fans them on the table felt: A
          royal flush in the suit of hearts, ace high.

          I do hope there are no hard

          Emma shrieks with delight, turning to Alice and Meg who grab
          each other, barely keeping themselves from pitching over,
          glasses spilling, as the other players applaud.
          Emma rakes in the Everest of multi-colored chips with both
          arms, laughing as she's congratulated.

          Alice, Meg and Emma burst through the salon doors into the
          street, their hair color richer, eyes brighter, a new
          lightness to their step; vivid, brilliantly polished versions
          of their essential selves.
          Heads turn as they set out together.

          INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

          The wings of a brass-framed three-way mirror spin and spread
          in a swirling kaleidoscope of shifting reflections:
          Alice, Meg and Emma work their way through an increasingly
          spectacular and audacious series of combinations, dresses and
          gowns, modeling for each other as they are tended to by
          SHOPGIRLS and SEAMSTRESSES...

           INT. BOUTIQUE - DAY

          Alice, Meg and Emma watch as a number of their dresses are
          boxed and a CASHIER writes them up.

                         SHOP GIRL
          Would you like these put on your
          account, Mademoiselle Scott?

                         ALICE
          No. Thank you, we'll be paying

                         CASH--

                         EMMA
          But, it would be darling if you
          could have them sent round our
          hotel.

                         MEG
          Wait. You know what, on second
          thought, I'm not getting these--
          She pulls the pair of jeans from her pile of clothes.

                         EMMA
          But, they looked amazing on you!

                         

          EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY


                         MEG
          Where was I ever going to wear
          them? Seriously?

                         EMMA
          You wear them here! Anywhere!
          Alice, you tell her--
          Alice opens her mouth, but stops herself as the three wander
          the crowded market stalls heaped with fountains of flowers in
          every color, breads, fresh produce, trinkets and souvenirs.

                         ALICE
          No. I'm not going to tell you what
          to do.

                         MEG
          Thank you. It's silly, anyway.
          They're just jeans. I want to find
          something for the kids--

                         EMMA
           Oh, Meg! Look! For Finn!

          Emma leaps to one of the stalls, seizing a profusion of 
          plastic jeweled tiaras displayed alongside photographs of
          Princess Grace. She places a tiara on her head, modeling.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          How perfect is this?!

                         ALICE
          Even better!
          Alice holds up a pair of pink satin toe shoes, swinging them
          from their ribbon laces.

          INT. SHOE REPAIR SHOP - DAY

          A SHOP OWNER (60's) slips a pair of freshly polished men's
          shoes into a paper bag, placing them on the counter in front
          of Richard, who pulls out his wallet.

                         RICHARD

                         (REMEMBERING)
          Oh. And the suitcase.
          The shop owner retrieves Alice's mended suitcase from a
          nearby shelf, a tag on the zipper.

          RICHARD (CONT'D) 
          How much do I owe you for that?

          EXT. STRIP MALL - DAY

          Richard exits the shoe repair carrying Alice'.s repaired
          suitcase, headed for his car.

                         GLENN
          Hey, Richard!
          Richard glances up to see Glenn crossing the parking lot with
          Seamus and Finn, pushing a cart piled high with groceries.

                         CUT TO:
          Richard finishes helping Glenn and the kids transfer grocery
          bags to the open trunk of Glenn's squad car.

                         GLENN (CONT'D)

                         (CLOSING TRUNK)
          So, we'll see you at seven then--

                         RICHARD
          And that's two with sausage, extra
          sauce, no onions--

          Got it.
          Richard picks up Alice's suitcase.

                         FINN
          Are you going to France, too?

                         RICHARD
          No. I just--
          Glenn turns, noticing the suitcase for the first time.

                         GLENN
          Whoa! Hold on! You're going to
          surprise Alice--?

          I love surprises!

          Oh, man, I win!
          Richard blinks as Glenn claps him on the shoulder.

                         GLENN (CONT'D)
          Meg and I've had this bet going:
          She thought it would be on Alice's
          next birthday, but I knew it was
          going to be this trip to France!

                         RICHARD
          Glenn, listen--

                         GLENN

          booked the best suite in Paris. Am

          Sure! That's why Alice loves you.
          You get how much this trip's meant
          to her; now, you're just putting
          the icing on the cake. The big
          gesture, you know? Not too
          dominating: Supportive. Loving!
          (shakes his head)
          You're the man, Richard. Big

          EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - DAY

          BERNARD ROCHAND (late 30's), an appealing Frenchman in a worn

                         
          sportscoat, pauses in collecting leeks when he spots Meg on
          the other side of the open stall.
          He watches as she surveys the rich array of fresh produce,
          lifting a tomato to her nose, inhaling with a private smile.
          Meg bites into the tomato, spurting juice onto her cheek and
          down her front.
          She looks up as she attempts to wipe the juice away, stopping
          when she catches Bernard smiling with amusement.
          Meg rolls her eyes with self-deprecation and moves on along
          the line of stalls.
          Bernard pays for his purchase and follows, finding Meg at
          another stall where a FRENCHWOMAN tries to communicate how to
          prepare the fish they both admire.
          Meg nods, not entirely understanding, but getting enough of
          it to gesture responses.
          The woman grabs some newspaper, wrapping the fish, and
          thrusts it towards Meg with a smile.

          to. But...
          The woman is confused, vaguely insulted.

                         MEG (CONT'D)
          I don't have a kitchen. No place
          to cook.

                         BERNARD
          She is only a visitor. Without a
          kitchen. But, it is a beautiful
          fish. Maybe next time.
          Meg turns to find Bernard beside her.

                         BERNARD (CONT'D)
          I have explained.
          Meg hesitates uncertainly before this friendly stranger.

                         MEG
          Well, thank you...
          She smiles at the woman and starts to walk away, only to find

                         
          Bernard falling into step with her.

                         BERNARD
          You are American.
          Meg glances at Bernard and away, uncomfortable, but curious,
          drawn by his warmth and the familiar greetings he exchanges
          with various vendors as they walk.

                         MEG
          From Wisconsin. Yes.
          Bernard reaches a handkerchief from his jacket for Meg.

                         BERNARD
          You cook in Wisconsin?
          Meg uses the handkerchief to blot the remaining tomato juice.

                         MEG
          I try. But... We don't have even
          half of this at home.

          Carlo, Meg?
          Meg's brow furrows slightly and she turns to head back.

          Look where we are! Can you even
          remember the last time we danced
          like this? It's gotta be-Martha

          They've got the best music.

          I am so butting in on that.
          Alice laughs and spins, crashing directly into Jean-Pierre.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          And I was looking for you!
          From the edge of the dance floor, NIKOLAI LUDOVIC (late 30s),
          squat, bald, completely nondescript but for his white tie and
          tails, watches Emma ardently.
          He stops a waiter, taking his tray of Champagne flutes.

                         
          Emma spins to find Nikolai at her elbow, grinning, holding up
          this offering, and she takes him for a waiter.

                         EMMA
          Ooh! Thank you! I'm so thirsty!
          Nikolai remains planted, holding his tray with a smile,
          watching with bright eyes as Emma drinks.
          She lowers her glass and her full attention snags on Nikolai,
          really registering his presence now as she searches his warm,
          gentle eyes.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          It's a wonderful party, isn't it?
          Nikolai nods and offers her another glass of Champagne.
          Alice, dancing with Jean-Pierre, subtly repositions herself
          in order to keep an eye on Emma.

                         JEAN-PIERRE

          Meg dances by herself, having a great time, taking in the
          room, the music and the people, when a handsome MAN begins to
          match her moves, insinuates himself.
          She smiles but shakes her head as she moves away, turning her
          back to evade him.
          Another gorgeous MAN sidles up to Meg, joining her solo
          dance, wiggling his eyebrows invitingly.

                         MEG
          No, thanks.
          She moves off only to be met by GIORGIO (40's, sexy, Euro-
          suave) who smoothly steps in.

          Emma slips away from dancing with Domenico, moving to Nikolai
          who remains with his tray at the ready,.brightening at her
          approach, lifting a glass.

                         EMMA

          Emma turns, still smiling, to find PENELOPE PENROSE (late
          20s, British), frail and bird-like, but attempting to hold a
          warrior's stance with her shoulders thrown back.

          She dodges away from Jean-Pierre, hooking Meg's arm in
          passing, yanking her away from Giorgio as she heads for Emma.

          Alice and Jean-Pierre walk along, side by side, their hands
          nearly touching, among the rest of the restaurant party.
          Alice looks up, taking in the bowl of pre-dawn sky, and
          glances over at Jean-Pierre who watches her.

          the two to walk on together as she comes back toward Alice.

          Alice looks around and sees Giorgio walking alone among the

          Bernard takes a tray of dishes from his FATHER (70's,
          striking resemblance) who enters from the dining room.

                         BERNARD
          Papa, sit down. Rest.

           Bernard enters with the tray, stopping when he sees Meg
          examining a menu by the front door of the empty bistro.

          You enjoyed your meal?

                         MEG
          Adding the fresh orange; nice.
          Bernards nods, accepting the compliment.

          We were--. We're going to watch

          Meg hesitates, turning between her friends and Bernard.

          Alice and Emma walk with Meg down the narrow street at the
          end of which the party guests stroll and Jean-Pierre waits
          for Alice, with Penelope, Domenico and Nikolai.

                         ALICE
          The guy from the market?

          Alice, Emma and Meg, arms linked, round the corner into the
          square with the rest of the party guests, just as the very
          edge of the sun crests the horizon of the open sea.
          Alice turns to Meg and Emma, sharing this moment so far
          beyond anything they could have dreamed.

                         MEG
          We'd be getting up now.

          The spell is broken by a TRIO OF PAPARAZZI who spring to life

          By the fountain!
          She runs for the sprays of water, pulling Alice and Meg, and
          the paparazzi meet them, flashing away.
          Leaning against the fountain's balustrade, Emma gestures for
          everyone to join them.

          Penelope, Domenico and Jean-Pierre join with other members of

          Her feet zip out from beneath her and she sails backwards
          over the balustrade, reaching for Alice and Meg, pulling them
          with her as the camera's flash.

          Richard skirts around a man with a newspaper to retrieve the
          bag and heads for customs.
          As Richard exits, the man folds his newspaper to its bold
          headline: SCOTT MAKES A SPLASH!, and a huge photograph of
          Emma, Alice and Meg laughing together in the fountain.

          want to go to the beach? Go to the
          beach. You want to go the market?
          Go! "Liberte, egalite,
          fraternite!"

                         EMMA

          Alice snatches up her purse and heads for the door.

                         ALICE
          It means everyone should do exactly
          what they want.

          Don't look at me like that.
          The door opens, and Alice re-enters, striding across the room
          for the desk, not looking at either Emma or Meg.

                         ALICE
          I just--. My guide book.
          She picks up her book and crosses back to the door.

          EXT. LE PETIT SOMMEIL HOTEL - DAY

          Richard steps from the hotel with a MANAGER (50's) who
          pantomimes that he recognizes Alice from the snapshot Richard
          shows him, but has no idea where she could be.
          Richard pulls out a map to point at a random spot and the
          manager gestures up the street, down the street, shrugging:
          She could be anywhere.

                         

          EXT. GRIMALDI PALACE - DAY

          Alice, amid a crowd of tourists, only half watches the
          changing of the guards outside the palace gates.
          She snaps herself out of her distraction with a shake of her
          head and turns to the marked pages in her guide book.

                         CARL
          Alice?
          She glances up to find Carl and Deedee from the tour.

          arms around both of them.

          Yes. That's right.

          Richard stands with his map beneath the arch where all roads
          come together in a spinning roundabout of bleating car horns.
          He looks down the length of the Champs Elysees, overwhelmed.
          The Japanese couple from Notre Dame approach Richard to ask
          directions and he shrugs helplessly, pressing the map on
          them, and steps out as a crosswalk signal turns to green.

          The car pulls away, Carl and Deedee turning in their seats to
          wave at Alice through the rear window.
          Alice waves until they are out of sight and slowly lowers her
          hand, standing alone in the street.
          A beat.
          Alice sighs and pulls out her guide book, unfolding a map as
          she looks up to gather her bearings.
          She takes in the quiet street, the view of the ocean, then
          looks back at the map in her hands.

                         
          She straightens up, a new look of purpose on her face, and
          crosses the street to toss her guide book and map in the
          trash can on the corner, striking out unaided down a narrow
          twisting street hung with vines and flowers.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING

          Alice rounds the corner of one street into the tight
          intersection of two narrow alleys in the fading twilight.
          She looks around,.cheeks flushed, hair pasted to her
          forehead, lost in a maze of dilapidated walled courtyards and
          apartment blocks; home to the city's service workers.
          She hesitates, then forges ahead down one street until she
          sees that it dead ends, and she doubles back.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - STREET - EVENING

          Alice suppresses panic as she walks briskly up a steep alley,
          high in the hills, trailed now by a small stray DOG.
          She stops, turns to the dog that also stops then sits.

          Penelope, dressed for the evening, gets up from reclining on
          the bed to join Emma who models a gown before a mirror.
          The two regard Emma's reflection, cocking their heads in an
          identical manner at precisely the same time.
          Penelope draws a necklace in gesture, indicating Emma's bare

                         
          collar bone.
          Emma turns, lit by an idea, and pulls the'steel briefcase

          Seated, Meg follows him with her eyes to the kitchen where
          Bernard works furiously at the stove, tossing the contents of
          a sauce pan with an expert flick of his wrist.

          massages his stockinged foot at a sidewalk table.
          He watches them stop, kiss, then continue on their way.
          A WAITER returns with Richard's change on a plate and Richard
          fits his shoe back on his foot, gathers his things to stand.
          He stops when he notices the front page of a newspaper folded
          on a chair at the next table.
          He quickly unfolds it to the photograph of Alice and Meg with
          Emma in the fountain, scans down to the caption: Cordelia
          Scott and friends in Monte Carlo. Hotel de Paris, etc...

          kabob, seated on the curb by a street vendor's food cart
          around which ALGERIAN MEN lounge in plastic lawn chairs.
           The dog looks at her avidly, hungry for more.
          Alice holds her kabob stick out for the dog to eat,
          surrendering her dinner with pleasure.
          As Alice sips from a bottle of beer, a soccer ball bounces
          off the curb and rolls to a stop beside her.
          She looks up as a ragtag BAND OF KIDS call from the dusty lot
          across the street, asking for their ball.

          of her element, when Giorgio approaches.

          How do you say "faster?"

          INT. BLUE RIBBON RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Bernard and Meg, flush from their ride, enter the kitchen
          through a back door, to be hailed by a half-dozen CHEFS
          crowded around a table littered with dishes.

          off. The end of every night.
          HENRI (60's, a bear in chef's whites) lumbers towards them.

                         HENRI
          No! No! No! We are only cooks
          allowed here!

          Ah, but, this is why we've come! I
          have finally found someone who can
          teach you how to cook!

          This is Meg, from America.

                         (TO MEG)
          And this is Henri, the worst
          egotist, my mentor.
          The two men embrace, merrily kissing each other on both
          cheeks, then Henri pulls Meg under his arm.

                         HENRI
           (turns to the table)
          A chef from America! Come to flip

          INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT - MOVING

          Jean-Pierre drives an open silver sports car full of PARTY
          GOERS down the twisting streets, when he sees the commotion
          and crowd around the dirt lot.
          Then he spots Alice running-around.

          EXT. MONTE CARLO - DIRT LOT - NIGHT

          Alice sticks like glue to a kid with the ball, maneuvers in,
          steals the ball, and doubles back in the opposite direction,
          racing up the field as the crowd laughs and claps.
          She passes the ball to kid who drives it to the goal, scores.
          Alice looks up from the game at the tapping of a car horn to
          see Jean-Pierre honking in celebration as he leans against
          the car with his GUESTS, enjoying the game.
          Alice stops to wave, and takes the ball full in the face.

          Jean-Pierre's smile winks out as Alice drops and he races 
          from the car as worried kids and spectators form a circle
          around Alice's prone body.
          The little dog licks Alice's face and she opens her eyes.
          She leaps up as Jean-Pierre crosses the lot.

                         ALICE
          I'm up! I'm up! Let's go!
          She sets off down the field with the kids.

          EXT. YACHT - PRE-DAWN

          Empty and half-filled glasses, bottles litter every surface
          along with plates, ashtrays, crumpled napkins.
          Emma sits on the lower landing deck, legs in the water, shoes
          in her hand, looking out at the lights.
          Nikolai moves his legs in the gentle current beside her,
          tuxedo trousers rolled, while he concentrates on working a
          napkin into intricate folds.
          Emma turns to look back at the silent boat.

                         

                         EMMA
          It doesn't seem fair. Leaving you
          to clean up all alone.

                         (THINKS)
          I'll help. But, you've really got
          to talk to your boss.
          Nikolai laughs, shaking his head.

          Ya ryadom.

                         EMMA

          sometimes... Not being understood.

                         (PAUSES)
          I know how that can feel.
          Nikolai holds up the napkin he's transformed into a crown
          adorned with flowers and the wire cages from Champagne corks.
          Emma looks at him, her face soft and vulnerable, open, as
          Nikolai places the makeshift crown on her head with care.

          Meg tries to follow the discussions and familiar teasing of
          the chefs as they pass plates, goading her to taste.
          She looks over at Bernard, who smiles as he holds his hands
          up at the scene, his boisterous friends, the food; as though

                         
          to say "this is good, enjoy."
          Meg relaxes her shoulders and gives in to the spirit of the
          table, spears a bite of food and lifts her glass to Bernard.

                         CUT TO:
          Meg and another chef, locked in a chopping duel, plow though
          onions at a blinding pace, their knives flashing, creating an
          escalating staccato on their cutting boards.
          Meg sweeps her onion from her board to a pan, and slams her
          knife down in victory as all the chefs erupt with applause.
          Henri seizes Meg's hand, raising her arm in the air, and
          presents her with a bottle of wine.
          Meg turns to Bernard, beaming, thrilled, utterly happy, as
          the other chefs clap her on the back, shake her hand.

          Hard to say. There are many.
          Alice steps out onto the hotel's roof with Jean-Pierre's
          jacket over her shoulders.

          ALICE (V.O.)
          Well, Africa, then. How often do
          you get to go?
          He leads her around the maze of skylights to the front of the
          building that faces the sea and the lightening sky.

          JEAN-PIERRE (V.0.)
          Not enough. Mostly I am on planes.
          To the places where sunlight and
          parties make people generous.

          EXT. HOTEL DE PARIS - ROOF - MOMENTS LATER

          Alice's smile flickers with a vague disappointment as she
          leans against the hotel's crown beside Jean-Pierre. 

                         ALICE
          That seems a shame...

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          But, I can think of one place I
          have never been. It is in my
          imagination only, so it is very
          special.
          He places an arm around Alice as they take in the view.

                         JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)
          It is just a small town, in a vast,
          open space. Maybe in the middle of
          America. There are people there
          like yourself, who are kind. And
          children who have everything they
          need.
          Alice turns to Jean-Pierre as he takes a strand of her hair
          in his fingers, and they hold a beat, looking at one another.

                         JEAN-PIERRE (CONT'D)

          Nikolai shrugs himself out of his formal shirt to stand
          before Emma in nothing but starfish printed boxer shorts.
          He lifts his hands: This is me. Here I am.
          Emma hesitates, then lets her gown fall around her, bare
          except for her panties, the necklace, and her napkin crown.
          Nikolai pushes himself off the side of the boat at a run,
          hiking up his legs into a cannonball. SPLASH!
          He surfaces and turns back to the boat just as Emma dives in
          with a SPLASH!
          She swims to Nikolai, pushing him under in a child's game,
          and he pops up, spitting water like a fountain.
          They laughs and Emma loops her arms around him.
          A beat as they sober.

                         
          Emma pulls Nikolai close to her, and they kiss.
          On the landing deck, Emma's gown shimmers in the morning sun
          with Nikolai's crown and Cordelia's yellow gem and diamond
          necklace nestled among its satin folds.

          Alice, still wearing Jean-Pierre's jacket, walks down the
          hall with Jean-Pierre close beside her, neither speaking.
          She turns to him when they reach the door of her suite.
          A long beat stretches, full of every possibility.

                         JEAN-PIERRE

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          This is why I ask. I would like to
          know you, Alice. Very much.
          Alice regards him a beat, then slowly pulls his jacket from
          her shoulders.

                         ALICE
          Before this, I'd never even been to
          France.
          Jean-Pierre blinks and Alice laughs, as much at herself.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          It's true. Just kept putting it
          off. Always managed to find an
          excuse. But, really, it was that I
          was afraid. That it couldn't ever
          live up to the France I'd imagined.
          And if it did... Then I'd never be
          able to go home.

          Alice gently places Jean-Pierre's jacket in his hands and
          steps near to kiss him on the lips.

          hisses into her cellphone.

          Richard begins to turn in Cordelia's direction, but the
          attendant corrects him, pointing the other way.

          Meg stops, holds a beat with her back to Bernard.
          Then she turns and marches to him with purpose, seizing his
          face in both her hands and kisses him passionately.
          She releases Bernard, who staggers against the moped,
          catching himself just before going over, as she turns again
          for the steps, an enormous smile on her face.

          Alice, I am so sorry! For what I
          said. About you. And Richard. I
          didn't mean any of it! I love you.
          I don't know how I would've gotten

          That I hadn't already been to
          France. It was like this wave, all
          the years, and chances I'd had but
          didn't take, they just crashed down
          on me: And I hadn't seen anything
          but the end of Lake Avenue. The
          only clear thought in my head was,
          "this guy is so wonderful, how can
          he marry half a person?"

                         MEG
          But, Alice. You were going. We
          were on our way.

          I thought he was asking me to make
          a choice. But, he wasn't. He
          wasn't doing that at all. It was
          me. Because I couldn't believe he
          loved me just for who I was.
          France or no.

                         (PAUSES)

          Honey, Richard knows you... It
          might feel like it's over. But,

          Alice opens the door for Emma who stands up from retrieving
          the morning paper just outside the door.

          When I already have everything I'll

          Alice exchanges a look with Meg as Emma swans across the
          suite to tear open on the fruit basket, pluck out an apple,
          and drape herself across a chaise.

          Alice unfolds the paper, taking in the image of Emma wearing
          Cordelia's necklace.

          It's funny if you think about it.
          I could have had a prince. A real
          one. But, I wanted my Niki--

          Cordelia strides across the lobby, passing WORKERS who set up

          A busy DESK CLERK glances up, brightening happily.

          Cordelia's luggage, crowned by the reassembled fruit basket.
          Cordelia, unimpressed, indicates the bags the bellhop holds.

          precariously perched atop the adjacent balcony's railing,
          back pressed against the face of the hotel.

          desperate faces from the balcony on the far side of Cordelia,

          If you're done, you may go.
          The bellboy turns but hesitates in catching a quick glimpse
          of Alice, fleet as a gazelle, as she passes the open doors on
          the balcony behind Cordelia.

                         CORDELIA (CONT'D)
          I said, you can go.

          scramble to their feet, grasping the side of the boat.

          Meg doubles over, hands on her knees as Emma stands over the
          empty spot on the landing.

                         ALICE
          Are you even sure you took it off?

                         EMMA
          Definite "yes."

                         ALICE
          Well... Were you this close to the
          edge? I mean, it could've fallen--

          Do not even say it!

          Emma take the aft, and I'll check
          the cabin.
          Emma glares at Alice with steely, narrowed eyes.

          She recoils, dropping the apple, which rolls across the
          carpet and hits one of Emma's sandals beneath the desk.

          In the Grimaldi Suite at the Hotel
           de Paris. You must come straight
          away. I've been robbed! And now
          some horrible, foreign man--! I
          believe someone is trying to kill
          me!

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAY

          Emma kisses Nikolai as she pushes him onto the elevator.

                         EMMA
          Wait for me in the lobby, sweetie.
          Down in half a second--

                         NIKOLAI
          Ya tebya lyublyu.

                         EMMA
          I know. Me, too.
          The doors close and Emma sprints back down the hall to Alice
          and Meg at the door.

                         EMMA (CONT'D)
          Okay! Do it!
          Alice rings the bell.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - DAY

          Cordelia approaches the door cautiously and spies through the
          peep hole at the back of Meg's head.

                         CORDELIA
          Yes? Who is it?

                         MEG

          Security, Madame.

                         CORDELIA
          Finally--!
          She opens the door.
          A beat where Cordelia focuses on Alice and Meg first,
          possibly remembering them, then she registers Emma.
          She blinks, completely nonplussed.

                         ALICE
          We can explain.

          The elevator doors open and Nikolai steps off just as the
          revolving door begins to spin, spitting uniformed POLICE
          OFFICERS and their CAPTAIN into the lobby.
          The clerk looks up and hustles around the desk to meet them.

                         CLERK
          Pardon? Is there a problem--?

                         POLICE CAPTAIN
          We received a report of an
          attempted murder in the Grimaldi
          Suite. Cordelia Scott--
          Richard, sitting nearby, looks up at the mention of
          Cordelia's name, at the same time that Nikolai takes a seat
          at the far end of the same sofa.

                         CLERK
          No. No. It is robbery. But,
          Mademoiselle Scott said it wasn't.
          Jean-Pierre, checking lists at the ballroom's entrance, notes
          the commotion and Cordelia's name, joins the group.

                         

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Excuse me. What's--? Mademoiselle
          Scott has been robbed?

                         CLERK
          No. She said, not.

                         POLICE CAPTAIN
          She said someone was trying to kill
          her! We are going up!
          Richard seems to debate getting involved as the police, the
          clerk and Jean-Pierre head for the elevators.
          Looking over, he notices Nikolai, who smiles and nods.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - LOBBY - DAY

          DING! Richard and Nikolai both look up as the elevator doors
          open and Emma emerges led by the police captain.
          Nikolai leaps up.

                         NIKOLAI
          Moy angelochek?
          Richard jumps up when he sees Jean-Pierre escorting an
          anxious Alice from the rear of the battalion.

                         RICHARD
          Alice?
          Alice winces as she sees Richard approaching, at the same
          time Nikolai rushes to Emma.

                         EMMA
          Niki, I'm sorry. It's just going
          to another minute.

                         NIKOLAI
          Ya sdelayu vsyo, chto smogoo--

                         

                         EMMA
          Perfect! That sounds good.
          Emma is led to the ballroom by the captain as Richard meets
          Alice and Jean-Pierre in the center of the lobby.

                         ALICE
          (quick, preemptive)
          Richard, this is Jean-Pierre, Jean-
          Pierre this is Richard, my fiance--

                         RICHARD JEAN-PIERRE

                         (BLINKS) (BLINKS)
          Fiance? Fiance?
          Jean-Pierre offers his hand to shake, smiling knowingly.

                         JEAN-PIERRE
          Ahh... A pleasure to meet you.
          You've come for the auction--?

                         ALICE
          Yes! He came all this way!
          Richard tightens his grip on Jean-Pierre's hand.

          Alice breaks Richard's vice grip with a bright smile.

                         ALICE
          I told you, that's Jean-Pierre!

                         (TO JEAN-PIERRE)
          He's exhausted! It's such a long
          trip!
          Richard flicks his eyes narrowly at Jean-Pierre.

                         JEAN-PIERRE

                         (DEFLECTING)
          I believe we are ready to start.
          Shall we go in?
          Alice loops an arm through Richard's to follow Jean-Pierre,
          but jerks to a stop when Richard doesn't budge.

                         RICHARD
          Is there something I need to know?
          Alice looks at Richard, reading his face, and smiles.

                         

                         ALICE
          No. There's isn't.
          She leads Richard through the ballroom entrance only to be
          stopped by an ATTENDANT.

                         ATTENDANT
          Pardon, Monsieur, invitation--?

                         ALICE
          He's with me!
          As Alice pulls Richard through to the ballroom, Nikolai steps
          to the reception table behind them, producing an elaborate
          invitation from inside his jacket.

                         ATTENDANT
          Oh! Monsieur Ludovic! Welcome!
          As Nikolai is ushered into the auction with great fanfare,
          the lobby's revolving doors turn and Bernard enters, carrying
          Meg's bottle of wine.

          Meg, holding the apple, sits facing Cordelia, still tied to a
          chair, the two glaring at each other.

                         CORDELIA
          You will never get away with this.

                         MY FATHER--

                         MEG
          Believe me, nothing would make me
          happier than having a little talk
          with your father--
          Both their heads swing toward the door when the bell RINGS!
          Meg jumps to Cordelia, stuffing the apple in her mouth just
          as she opens it to scream.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - HALLWAY - DAY

          Bernard looks up when Meg opens the door a crack.

                         MEG
          Bernard...?
           He holds out the bottle of wine.

                         BERNARD
          We forgot your prize.

                         MEG
          Oh, I...
          She glances back into the room behind her, carefully
          obscuring Bernard's view through the half open door.

                         BERNARD
          I have come at a bad time?

                         MEG
          No. No, Bernard, that's not it.

          INT. HOTEL DE PARIS - SUITE - BEDROOM - DAY

          Cordelia kicks her legs against the floor, straining against
          the scarf as she tries to overturn the chair.

          I think--. You are busy. I think
          now I go--
          Meg reaches out to stay him with a hand on his arm.

          No. Bernard, wait--
          CLICK! Meg and Bernard both turn their heads to look down
          the corridor when Cordelia sticks her head out the bedroom
          door into the hall.
          A beat as Cordelia and Meg lock eyes.
          DING! The elevator doors open at the end of the hall, closer
          to Cordelia.
          She looks back at Meg for an instant then bolts as Meg leaps
          past Bernard into the hall.

          There! You see?

          We'd never been anywhere. And we
          took a trip, that didn't belong to
          us... Because, well, because you
          thought we were... important. And
          that she was Cordelia...
          Richard smiles at Alice, supporting her with his gaze.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          We wanted to help.

                         MEG

                         (TO BERNARD)
          We never meant to mislead anyone--

                         (TO NIKOLAI)
          Or hurt anyone--

           We're very sorry. And, we're
          willing to face the consequences,
          whatever they are... But...
          She turns to Meg and Emma as a smile blossoms.

                         ALICE (CONT'D)
          But, this was our adventure.

                         MEG
          And it was an excellent one.

                         ALICE
          We wouldn't change a minute of it.

                         EMMA
          Not for anything in the world.
          Richard takes the pulse of the frighteningly still crowd, the,
          hesitating police, the charged air in the room.

                         RICHARD

          The crowd gasps and Alice gapes at Richard.

               BUILDING EXCAVATION - DAY

               Leaning on a railing looking down into the excavation are a 
               group of sidewalk supervisors. The CAMERA MOVES UP to a HEAD 
               CLOSEUP of one of them. It is Bill Cole (Melvyn Douglas), a 
               well-dressed, intelligent, attractive looking young man.

                                     BILL
                         I suppose you're wondering what all 
                         this has to do with Mr. Blandings 
                         and his Dream House? Well, I'll tell 
                         you. Jim Blandings is part of the 
                         fabric of this town. Born and raised 
                         right here, he's as typical a New 
                         Yorker as anyone you'll ever meet. 
                         At least he was.
                              (confidentially)
                         And if you want to know the real 
                         story, I guess I'm your boy. Cole's 
                         my name, Bill Cole. I'm Jim's lawyer 
                         and quote, best friend, unquote. 
                         Jim's one of those bright young men 
                         from Yale. Advertising business, 
                         lovely wife, two fine kids, makes

               A BILLBOARD

               A billboard -- against a white background is a large ham. In

                                    (A WHALE OF A HAM)

               And below this in quotes:

               EXT. A LARGE NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

               As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window:

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         For fourteen years Jim and Muriel 
                         had been living in their apartment 
                         over on East Seventy-fourth Street. 
                         It was just another of those wonderful 
                         crisp September mornings and the 
                         Blandings were still asleep. Just 
                         like millions of other people in 
                         good old Manhattan -- New York City -- 
                         U.S.A.

               The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY

               Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep 
               in twin beds.

               The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression 
               of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, 
               oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge 
               take up an inordinate amount of space.

               SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself 
               into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for 
               the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing 
               his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous 
               path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails 
               going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously 
               pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping 
               over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the 
               chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the 
               alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get 
               the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking 
               morning of his life.

               Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes 
               with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, 
               however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward 
               the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is 
               sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and 
               shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and 
               starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.

               We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of 
               the Blandings' daily routine.

               Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, 
               can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens 
               the door.

               INT. THE CLOSET

               This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended 
               to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel 
               Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, 
               it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, 
               slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit 
               or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf 
               above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an 
               orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance.

               Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one 
               out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small 
               for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put 
               it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between 
               two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down 
               and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled 
               under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, 
               leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at 
               Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom 
               and into the narrow hall.

               INT. THE HALL

               A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off 
               it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room 
               and the foyer.

               Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom 
               door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.

                                     BETSY'S VOICE
                         Okay, dad.

                                     JIM
                         Mm.

               Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the 
               children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and 
               enters.

               INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM

               A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements 
               of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of 
               the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off 
               Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.

                                     JOAN
                         Okay, dad.

                                     JIM
                         Mm.

               As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits 
               into the hall.

               INT. THE HALL

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, 
               on through the very small combination dining and breakfast 
               nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the 
               colored cook, greets him heartily.

                                     GUSSIE
                         'Morning, Mr. Blandings!

                                     JIM
                              (a feeble attempt at 
                              a smile)
                         Mm.

               Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, 
               stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight 
               face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black 
               coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.

               INT. THE HALL

               Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the 
               door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he 
               pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, 
               towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She 
               disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down 
               the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to 
               the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the 
               way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and 
               shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. 
               Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM

               Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters, walks over, nudges 
               her.

                                     JIM
                         Muriel.

                                     MURIEL
                         Mm?

                                     JIM
                         Coffee.

               Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, 
               takes the cup.

                                     MURIEL
                         Thank you, dear.

               They kiss briefly. Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim 
               goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of 
               small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles 
               through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of 
               underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look 
               through the other drawers.

                                     MURIEL
                         Looking for something, dear?

                                     JIM
                              (briefly)
                         My socks.

                                     MURIEL
                         Why don't you look in your sock 
                         drawer?

                                     JIM
                              (with restraint)
                         That's where I found my underwear.

                                     MURIEL
                         Oh.
                              (brightly)
                         Well, try your underwear drawer.

                                     JIM
                         I'm in my underwear drawer.

               He reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips.

                                     MURIEL
                              (sipping coffee)
                         Well, they must be somewhere.
                              (attempt at morning 
                              cheeriness)
                         Socks just don't get up and walk 
                         away by themselves.

                                     JIM
                              (strained patience)
                         Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a-
                         half drawers were to be mine! I wish 
                         you'd tell Gussie --

                                     MURIEL
                         The closet! That's where they are. 
                         We put them in the closet.

                                     JIM
                         Socks? In the closet?

                                     MURIEL
                         Well, there didn't seem to be any 
                         room in the drawers...

                                     JIM
                         And there's so much of it in the 
                         closet!

                                     MURIEL
                         ...so Gussie and I decided that from 
                         now on we'll keep them in a basket 
                         on the shelf.

                                     JIM
                         Well, thanks a lot!

               He strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up 
               for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so, 
               all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket 
               from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to 
               explode, he looks at Muriel.

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort 
                         to be a little less clumsy.

                                     JIM
                              (barely containing 
                              himself)
                         I'll try, dear.

               Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts 
               the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where 
               they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes 
               the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks 
               and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is 
               a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a 
               look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his 
               mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, 
               takes another sip of coffee.

               INT. THE HALL

               Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He 
               quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment 
               later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe 
               around her.

                                     JOAN
                              (sharply)
                         Father, just one morning I wish you'd 
                         knock!

                                     JIM
                              (to her back as she 
                              walks away)
                         'Morning, dear.

               Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.

               INT. THE BATHROOM

               Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, 
               yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. 
               He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, 
               scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines 
               the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. 
               Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about 
               to use, frowns.

               WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE

               WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in 
               the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves.

               CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE

               CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls 
               up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small 
               amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously 
               to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free 
               hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he 
               opens.

               CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET

               CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with 
               medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.

               CLOSE SHOT - JIM

               CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top 
               shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate 
               one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the 
               iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops 
               out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle 
               of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it 
               back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, 
               contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He 
               finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and 
               steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, 
               scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full 
               cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries 
               the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet 
               hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray 
               Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He 
               starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "Home 
               On The Range."

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               JIM

               Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. 
               Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is 
               singing a lusty chorus of "Home On The Range." Jim picks up 
               his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, 
               as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary 
               resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. 
               As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he 
               gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs 
               freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that 
               the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation 
               toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach 
               for a towel, start to dry herself.

               The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During 
               this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes 
               into scene.

                                     MURIEL
                              (reaching for 
                              toothbrush)
                         Excuse...

               She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get 
               the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to 
               squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he 
               continues shaving.

               CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL

               CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet 
               and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to 
               her brush.

               JIM AND MURIEL

               Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel 
               closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his 
               original position as he follows the mirror.

                                     JIM
                         Excuse...

               Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They 
               both hum "Home On The Range". Her mouth full, Muriel taps 
               Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves 
               to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her 
               face in the mirror.

                                     JIM
                              (impatiently)
                         If you don't mind, dear.

               As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to 
               look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides 
               she needs a little skin lotion.

                                     MURIEL
                              (as she steps in front 
                              of him)
                         Sorry.

               She again opens the cabinet. Jim once more follows the mirror 
               around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded. 
               Muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.

                                     MURIEL
                         Moment, dear.

                                     JIM
                         Take your time. I can spare the blood.

                                     MURIEL
                              (looks up)
                         Oh... cut yourself?

                                     JIM
                         I cut myself every morning. I kind 
                         of look forward to it.

                                     MURIEL
                         Why don't you get an electric razor?

                                     JIM
                              (trying to shave)
                         Don't like them. No close shave.

                                     MURIEL
                         Ridiculous! Bill Cole's been using 
                         one for years.

                                     JIM
                         He doesn't have my beard!

                                     MURIEL
                         That's silly. Bill's beard is just 
                         as tough and coarse and --

                                     JIM
                              (irritably)
                         I'm not interested in discussing the 
                         grain and texture of Bill Cole's 
                         hair follicles before I've had my 
                         orange juice.

                                     MURIEL
                         You don't have to carry on so. I 
                         only said, why don't you get an 
                         electric razor?

                                     JIM
                         Because I prefer the cool, clean 
                         sweep of the tempered steel as it 
                         glides smoothly --

                                     MURIEL
                         Stop writing advertising copy! Hurry 
                         up, dear, you'll be late for 
                         breakfast.

               Muriel exits. Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a 
               few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the 
               water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed 
               in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously 
               smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens 
               the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. 
               The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies 
               his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts 
               slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he 
               slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly 
               slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. He reacts 
               masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for 
               the door. As he reaches it, there is the SOUND of the cabinet 
               opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the 
               washstand. As Jim winces,

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

               Narrow and small. The four Blandings are at breakfast, Jim 
               and Muriel each reading his section of the morning paper, 
               Betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook, Joan engrossed in 
               a magazine of popular science. As we come in, Gussie, taking 
               off the orange juice, is squeezing by Jim who accordingly 
               and automatically ducks his head as she passes. Jim 
               uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page, folds it, 
               reacts with pained but controlled exasperation.

                                     JIM
                         ...Who did this?

               INSERT NEWSPAPER, a section of which has been cut out.

               BACK TO SCENE.

                                     BETSY
                              (very matter-of-factly)
                         I did.

               She holds out her hand to Joan, who, automatically, and 
               without looking up hands her the salt.

                                     JIM
                         I have repeatedly told you --
                              (ducking as Gussie 
                              comes back with coffee)
                         -- don't cut up the morning paper 
                         until I've had a chance to look at 
                         it!

                                     BETSY
                         I'm sorry, father. It's necessary 
                         research.

               She hands the salt back to Joan who automatically passes it 
               to Muriel.

                                     JIM
                              (with some sarcasm)
                         I suppose this is another of Miss 
                         Stellwagon's so-called Progressive 
                         Projects?

                                     MURIEL
                              (using salt and handing 
                              it to Jim)
                         Now dear, there just isn't any point 
                         in sending your children to an 
                         expensive school if you're going to 
                         undermine the teacher's authority in 
                         your own dining room.

                                     JIM
                         I'm not undermining anything. I happen 
                         to be in the advertising business 
                         and keeping abreast of the times is 
                         important to me.

                         And so is your children's education.

                                     JIM
                         That's not the point.

                                     MURIEL
                         It certainly is.

                                     JIM
                         It certainly is not!

                                     JOAN
                              (without looking up 
                              from her magazine)
                         Bicker, bicker, bicker.

                                     JIM
                         You eat your cornflakes!

               Jim ducks as Gussie passes back on her way to the kitchen.

                              (handing Joan toast)
                         Joan, every time your father and I 
                         have a lively discussion we aren't 
                         necessarily bickering.
                              (to Betsy; solicitously)
                         What is it, dear, another English 
                         composition?

                                     BETSY
                              (taking toast from 
                              Joan)
                         Miss Stellwagon has assigned each of 
                         us to take a want ad and write a 
                         human interest theme about it.
                              (to Jim; passing toast 
                              to him)
                         I found one typical of the 
                         disintegration of our present society.

                                     JIM
                              (taking toast, not 
                              looking up from his 
                              paper)
                         I wasn't aware of the fact that our 
                         society was disintegrating.

                                     BETSY
                         I didn't expect you to be, father. 
                         Miss Stellwagon says that middle-
                         class people like us are all too 
                         prone to overlook the pressures and 
                         tensions which befall the less 
                         fortunate members of our community.

               Jim puts down the paper, turns to Muriel.

                                     JIM
                              (with great restraint)
                         Muriel, I know it's asking a lot, 
                         but just one morning I would like to 
                         sit down and have breakfast without 
                         social significance!

               Picks up his paper.

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim, you really might take a little 
                         more interest in your children's 
                         education.

                                     JOAN
                              (without looking up)
                         You can't squeeze blood from a turnip.

               Jim reacts with painful resignation, folds his arms, puts 
               down the paper, turns slowly to Betsy.

                                     JIM
                         All right. All right. I'll listen.

                              (picking up her 
                              scrapbook)
                         It's just twenty-four words. But in 
                         simple eloquence it mirrors a minor 
                         tragedy of our times.

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         Well?...

                                     BETSY

                                     JIM
                         Go on.

                         That's all.

                                     JIM
                         That's all?!

                                     BETSY
                         You don't see it, do you, father?

                                     JIM
                         No. Fellow wants to sell a house so 
                         he puts an ad in the paper. What did

                         There must be more to it than that.
                              (to Betsy)
                         Isn't there, dear?

                                     BETSY
                         Certainly, mother. What some people 
                         don't see is the whole sordid picture. 
                         A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the 
                         wall by hardship, soil erosion, 
                         mortgages, everybody gobbling, 
                         gobbling, gobbling, until finally, 
                         in desperation, he is "forced to 
                         sell," and stoops to the crass 
                         commercialism of newspaper 
                         advertising.

                                     JIM
                              (muttering)
                         Oh, indeed... crass commercialism... 
                         advertising...

                         Miss Stellwagon says advertising is 
                         a basically parasitic profession.

                                     JIM
                              (with extreme control)
                         Oh, she does?

                                     JOAN
                         Miss Stellwagon says that advertising 
                         makes people who can't afford it buy 
                         things they don't want with money 
                         they haven't got.

                                     JIM
                              (elaborate sarcasm)
                         Perhaps your Miss Stellwagon is right. 
                         Perhaps I ought to get out of this 
                         "basically parasitic profession," 
                         which at the moment is paying for 
                         her very fancy tuition, those extra 
                         French lessons, her progressive summer 
                         camp and for that matter, the very 
                         braces on your teeth!

                                     MURIEL
                         I wish you wouldn't discuss money in 
                         front of the children.

                                     JIM
                         Why not, they spend enough of it!

                                     JOAN
                         Bicker, bicker, bicker.

               As Jim gives her a look and buries himself in his paper, the 
               downstairs buzzer rings. Gussie enters, squeezes by Jim who 
               automatically ducks, goes to the phone in b.g.

                                     GUSSIE
                         Hello. Who?
                              (calls)
                         Miss Blandings, there's a Mr. 
                         Funkhauser wants to see you.

                                     MURIEL
                         Funkhauser?
                              (remembers)
                         Oh, Mr. Funkhauser!

                                     GUSSIE
                         That's what he says.

               Muriel looks nervously at Jim who is preoccupied, reading 
               his paper. Then she turns back to Gussie.

                                     MURIEL
                         Uh -- better ask him to come up.

                                     GUSSIE
                              (into phone)
                         Says to come up.

               Gussie hangs up, squeezes by Jim, exits into the kitchen. 
               Pause.

                                     MURIEL
                              (tentatively)
                         Oh -- uh -- darling, Mr. Funkhauser's 
                         here.

                                     JIM
                              (looking up)
                         ...Who?

                                     MURIEL
                         You remember, Bunny Funkhauser, that 
                         clever young interior decorator we 
                         met at the Collins' cocktail party?

                                     JIM
                              (distastefully)
                         What's he doing here?

                                     MURIEL
                              (nervously)
                         Well, I imagine he's brought the -- 
                         uh -- estimates.

                                     JIM
                              (blankly)
                         ...Estimates?

                                     MURIEL
                              (rapidly; to conceal 
                              a feeling of guilt)
                         Darling, you know how long we've 
                         said we've got to do something about 
                         this apartment, and, well, he called 
                         last week, and I had him come over, 
                         and he's got some simply wonderful 
                         ideas!

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         There couldn't be two Bunny 
                         Funkhausers, could there?

                                     MURIEL
                         Why, no, dear.

                                     JIM
                         Then this is the same clever young 
                         man who's responsible for that zebra-
                         striped monstrosity in the Collins' 
                         living room?

                                     MURIEL
                         That couch is terribly functional.

                                     JIM
                         Phil Collins told me what he paid 
                         for all that function!
                              (angrily)
                         If you think I'm going to --

               SOUND of doorbell ringing.

                                     MURIEL
                         Darling, please!
                              (changing subject)
                         Children, you'll be late to school. 
                         Run along and --

               The children rise, pick up their school paraphernalia.

                                     JOAN
                         Miss Stellwagon says that 
                         functionalism in modern furniture --

                                     MURIEL
                         Never mind, dear.

               She hustles Betsy and Joan toward the foyer as Jim rises.

               Gussie has just admitted Mr. Funkhauser. He is a tall, 
               slender, effete-looking, young man. He is loaded down with 
               sketches, samples of wallpaper, bolts of material. Betsy and 
               Joan brush by him on their way out.

                         Good morning.

                                     THE GIRLS
                              (with a sharp 
                              appraising look)
                         Hi.

               As they rush out and the door closes, Jim and Muriel enter 
               scene.

                                     MURIEL
                         Good morning, Mr. Funkhauser. You 
                         remember Mr. Blandings?

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         But of course.

               He sweeps by them into the living room, taking over 
               completely.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         You'll have to pardon my bursting in 
                         at this dreary hour --
                              (puts a sketch on a 
                              chair)
                         -- practically the middle of the 
                         night --
                              (puts wallpaper against 
                              mantel)
                         -- but I did so want to catch you 
                         in. I've been at it hammer and tongs 
                         all week and I'm just a mess --
                              (drapes bolt of chintz 
                              over high-backed 
                              chair)
                         -- but then Muriel and I thought we 
                         ought to talk it over with you before 
                         we take the plunge...

               Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to 
               display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for 
               Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds 
               flowing down in front. As Jim reacts:

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                              (smoothing out folds 
                              on the chintz)
                         After all, it's your home, too, and 
                         it should reflect you. You know, 
                         Man's Castle, all that sort of thing.

               Jim looks down at the chintz.

                                     JIM
                              (ominously)
                         Muriel!

                                     MURIEL
                              (quickly)
                         Jim, just wait till you hear. He's 
                         got some wonderful ideas for the 
                         foyer.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the 
                         whole thing! I just couldn't live 
                         with it! I said to myself, "Bunny, 
                         what are the Blandings? How shall we 
                         do them?" And the answer was perfectly 
                         obvious. Very American, very grass 
                         roots, very blueberry pie -- that 
                         sort of thing.

                                     JIM
                              (dark look at Muriel)
                         Mm.

               Funkhauser fingers the material of a drape, disdainfully 
               removes his hand.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Now first, let's dig into this living 
                         room of yours, it's really a dreary.

                                     MURIEL
                              (quickly; to Jim)
                         We want this room to be very gay, 
                         dear. Something in bright reds, 
                         yellows and greens.

                                     JIM
                              (appalled)
                         Red, yellow and green?!

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Oh, come, Mr. Blandings, let's not 
                         run away from color.

                                     JIM
                         Not running away --
                              (a lame joke)
                         -- just backing off a little.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Uh -- yes.
                              (brightly)
                         Now as I see our room, it's definitely 
                         Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench, 
                         breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, 
                         hooked rug. But everything in good 
                         taste. It must not jump out at you 
                         and scream: "Look -- see how antique 
                         I am!"

                                     JIM
                         Heaven forbid.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Of course, these things take 
                         imagination. You've simply got to be 
                         able to visualize.

                                     JIM
                              (politely, removing 
                              chintz)
                         If you'll forgive me, Mr. Funkhauser, 
                         what I'd like to visualize -- at 
                         this dreary hour -- is how much is 
                         this all going to cost?

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Well, really, I hesitate to say. 
                         After all --
                              (indicates)
                         -- by the time this wall is out we 
                         may find --

                                     JIM
                              (reacting)
                         This wall is -- what?

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Out. Source of light is from the 
                         east. Obviously if our room is to 
                         have any function at all --

                                     JIM
                         You're going to tear out the wall?!

                                     MURIEL
                         Dear, it's a wonderful notion.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Visualize three feet of leaded panes, 
                         the rest --

                                     JIM
                         Can you give me a figure?

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Well! Costs aren't what they used to 
                         be, you know, and --

                                     JIM
                         Just a figure.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Materials are impossible, labor has 
                         just run wild --

                                     JIM
                         Just an overall figure.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Well!... I shouldn't like to be tied 
                         down. But I suppose if you must have 
                         a figure, I'd say -- mm --
                              (lightly)
                         -- somewhere in the neighborhood of 
                         seven.

                                     JIM
                         Mm... Seven.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                              (nodding)
                         Mm.

                                     JIM
                         That would be seven... thousand?

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Mm.

               Jim looks at Muriel, considers.

                                     JIM
                              (soberly)
                         We-ll. That seems fair.
                              (gathering up materials)
                         After all, we're not running away 
                         from color --
                              (picks up wallpaper)
                         -- and we are tearing out walls --
                              (picks up sketches)
                         Mr. Funkhauser, do you have a card?

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim, we haven't even discussed the 
                         rest of the house.

                                     JIM
                         We will, dear.
                              (leads the whole batch 
                              on Funkhauser)

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                              (huffy)
                         Well, really, I --

                                     JIM
                              (deftly steering him 
                              toward the door)
                         We'll talk it all out and then we'll 
                         get in touch with Bunny.

               CAMERA TRUCKS with them to the door.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         Well, really, I mean, I was under 
                         the impression we'd come to some 
                         decision today.

                                     JIM
                         I'm sure we will.

                                     FUNKHAUSER
                         We-ll!

                                     JIM
                         So nice of you to come.
                              (puts Funkhauser's 
                              hat on his head)
                         Good day.

               And Funkhauser is gone. Jim closes the door, turns ominously.

                                     MURIEL
                              (apprehensively)
                         Now darling, you -- you just don't 
                         go to a man like Funkhauser and ask 
                         how much it's going to cost before 
                         you even know what he's going to do!

                                     JIM
                         No, that would be too logical! Seven 
                         thousand dollars! Blueberry pie! I 
                         wouldn't put seventy-five cents into 
                         this broken-down rat trap!

                                     MURIEL
                              (sentimentally)
                         It's our home, Jim. Betsy was 
                         practically born in this apartment.

                                     JIM
                         That does not make it a national 
                         shrine!
                              (vehemently)
                         Seven thousand dollars and not one 
                         word about closets.

                                     MURIEL
                         Closets! You wouldn't even let him 
                         get to the bathroom!

                                     JIM
                         I haven't got that kind of money!

                                     MURIEL
                         The way you talk, Jim Blandings, 
                         you'd think I was some kind of 
                         congenital idiot!

                                     JIM
                         Sometimes I'm beginning to wonder!

                                     MURIEL
                              (furious)
                         You can just get out of here!

                                     JIM
                         That's not a bad idea!

               He angrily jerks open the hall closet door, pulls his hat 
               down from the shelf, several hat boxes, some ski boots and a 
               tennis racket tumbling down on his head. Jim jams his hat 
               onto his head, takes a deep breath and storms out, slamming 
               the door. Muriel walks over to the closet, is about to bend 
               down and pick up a hatbox when all of her pent-up emotions 
               explode. She kicks the hat box into the closet, slams the 
               door, starts to cry.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE OF JIM'S OFFICE - DAY

               Exiting from the elevator, Jim enters a door marked:

                                    DASCOMB AND BANTON
                                       ADVERTISING

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. JIM'S OFFICE - DAY

               On the wall are various framed copies of Jim's handiwork. 
               Most prominent are advertisements for a meat product called 
               "Wham!" "A Whale of a Ham!" There is ample evidence of the 
               fact that Jim's most successful slogan is: "When you've got 
               the Whim - say 'Wham!'"

               Jim enters, goes to his desk, sits down, still emotionally 
               upset. He glances at a photograph of Muriel, looks guiltily 
               away, then back.

                                     JIM
                              (to photograph)
                         Sorry.

               His secretary enters.

                                     MARY
                         Good morning, Mr. Blandings.

                                     JIM
                              (briefly)
                         'Morning.

                         You wanted to see the color copy 
                         from this month's House and Stream.

               She hands him a magazine. He looks at it perfunctorily, is 
               about to hand it back when his eye is caught by an ad on the 
               back cover.

               INSERT THE BACK COVER - A COMMUNITY AND EXTOLLING LIFE IN

               INSERT THE BACK COVER - A community and extolling life in 
               the country, sponsored by a group of realtors, local chamber 
               of commerce etc. Over a pastoral scene of lovely little houses 
               checkering a rolling landscape are the words:

               Jim - Mary.

                                     JIM
                              (looking up; blankly)

                         Will that be all?

               Without answering he turns back to the ad. The CAMERA COMES 
               IN for a HEAD CLOSEUP as he studies the ad and on the sound 
               track we hear:

               As he looks up thoughtfully:

                         Well, that's the way it all started. 
                         The ad was enough to convince Jim --

               Jim and Muriel - They are leaving Manhattan, entering the 
               Merritt Parkway. Muriel, wearing an orchid corsage, looks 
               curiously at Jim. His answering gesture says, "Just wait and 
               see." Over this:

                         -- But Muriel was a little tougher. 
                         I guess the corsage did it.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - They are driving through a 
               beautiful Connecticut countryside. Mr. Smith, a local real 
               estate dealer, is of that shrewd Yankee breed which 
               specializes in the understatement, underselling school of 
               salesmanship.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         There they are, two little fish from 
                         New York -- out in the deep deep 
                         waters of Connecticut real estate. 
                         That's Smith, the real estate 
                         salesman. Mighty shrewd cookie in a 
                         quiet sort of way. Never thought 
                         he'd get a bite this quick.

               Smith looks speculatively at the Blandings.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Now he's sizing up the catch. "Mm. 
                         Let's see. Convertible -- orchids -- 
                         must be pretty well fixed. Wonder if 
                         they're lookers or buyers?"

               Jim takes a deep breath, looks at Muriel as if to say, "Get 
               that air!" Muriel smiles with approval. Jim pats her hand 
               affectionately. Smith reacts.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         They're buyers.
                              (confidentially)
                         Yes, sir, Smith, looks like you're 
                         finally going to unload the old 
                         Hackett place. Now first thing is 
                         get 'em a little anxious.

               Jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque-
               looking old Connecticut farmhouse. He and Muriel react with 
               approval, look questioningly at Smith. Smith shakes his head, 
               "no," as though to say, "Not nearly good enough for you."

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Th-a-a-t's right!

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Jim, Muriel, Mr. Smith - They pass another house. Jim and 
               Muriel appraise it with interest, look at Smith.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Uh-uh, not yet.

               Smith firmly shakes his head "no."

                                                                   DISSOLVE

                         Take it easy, Smith, give 'em a little 
                         more line.

               Smith shakes his head "no".

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - The car pulls to a stop.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Now we're ready to gaff 'em.

                                     SMITH
                              (proudly)
                         Well, folks, there she is -- the old 
                         Hackett Place.

               The Blandings look off, react with interest and approval.

               WHAT THEY SEE -- BURROWED INTO THE UPWARD SLOPE

               What they see -- Burrowed into the upward slope of the land 
               is the old Hackett farmhouse. If the roof seems to sway a 
               little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the 
               overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, 
               charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy 
               years come next April. However, the overall effect is 
               definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. In the back are 
               a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as 
               Bald Mountain.

                              (involuntarily)
                         It's simply charming!

               Jim's look cautions against her over-enthusiasm.

                                     MURIEL
                         That is, for an old house.

                                     JIM
                              (casually)
                         Of course, you understand, Mr. Smith, 
                         we're just window shopping, so to 
                         speak. Nothing really definite in 
                         mind.

                                     SMITH
                         Perfectly all right.

                                     JIM
                              (studies house; with 
                              assumed indifference)
                         Mm. Not a bad-looking place, but 
                         it's certainly a lot older than 
                         anything we had in mind.

                                     SMITH
                         She's no spring chicken --
                              (sagely)
                         -- but that's just what makes her 
                         such a buy.

               They look at him curiously. Smith's attitude is matter-of-
               fact, almost without enthusiasm.

                                     SMITH
                         This isn't just old timber, or a 
                         virgin stand oak grove other side of 
                         the trout stream, or a couple of 
                         fruit orchards... You're buying a 
                         piece of American history.

                                     JIM
                              (interested in spite 
                              of himself)
                         You don't say! How's that?

                                     SMITH
                         First year she was built, General 
                         Gates stopped right here to water 
                         his horses.

                         Oh. Oh, that General Gates. Hear 
                         that, honey, General Gates!

                                     MURIEL
                              (with concern)
                         Wouldn't that make the house over a 
                         hundred years old?

                                     SMITH
                              (proudly)
                         Hundred and seventy come next April.

               The Blandings exchange a doubtful look which Smith catches.

                                     SMITH
                         Now I'm not trying to sell you 
                         anything -- all I'm saying is that 
                         one of these days someone with a 
                         little vision and imagination's goin' 
                         to come along, and just steal this 
                         place --
                              (confidentially)
                         and I mean steal it.

               The Blandings, as one, turn to the house with renewed 
               interest. This is not lost on Smith.

                                     SMITH
                         Mr. Blandings, I know you can look 
                         at that house and just about picture 
                         what a couple of coats of paint and 
                         a little pointing up here and there 
                         can do to it.

                         Mm.

               The CAMERA MOVES TO a HEAD CLOSEUP of Jim as he begins to 
               visualize

               WHAT HE SEES

               WHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place suddenly DISSOLVES into 
               the New Blandings' Place -- Jim's version. It is a lovely 
               country house. Massive. Masculine. Jim, in jodhpurs, tweed 
               coat, pipe and accompanied by two large Irish Setters, is 
               proudly surveying his property. He nonchalantly holds a sleek, 
               beautiful shotgun in the most precisely correct position.

               CLOSE SHOT - JIM'S FACE.

               CLOSE SHOT - Jim's face. His lips don't move but we hear his 
               voice.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         Hm. Wonder what he meant by "steal?"

               THREE SHOT.

               THREE SHOT.

                                     SMITH
                         And I guess I don't have to tell 
                         you, Mrs. Blandings, what a woman's 
                         touch could do to a place like this.

                                     MURIEL
                         Well --

               CAMERA MOVES to a HEAD CLOSEUP of Muriel as she starts to 
               visualize.

               WHAT SHE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE

               WHAT SHE SEES - The Old Hackett Place DISSOLVES into a dainty, 
               feminine cottage with criss-cross curtains at the window and 
               a lovely little white rail fence enclosing "her garden." 
               Muriel, in delightful gingham, is in the garden, admiring 
               her latest triumph - the largest rose ever grown in Lansdale 
               County.

               CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL'S FACE.

               CLOSE SHOT - Muriel's face. Her face is soft. Her lips don't 
               move but we hear:

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                         It is a nice old house. It just needs 
                         someone to love it, that's all.

               THREE SHOT

               THREE SHOT

                                     SMITH
                         Yes, sir, you've certainly got to 
                         visualize.

               CAMERA MOVES to a HEAD CLOSEUP of Smith as he, too, begins 
               to visualize.

               WHAT HE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE.

               WHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place. Suddenly SUPERIMPOSED 
               over it in large figures is:

                                        $9,000.00

               GROUP SHOT - SMITH LOOKS AT HIM AND MURIEL

               GROUP SHOT - Smith looks at Him and Muriel who are looking 
               at the house with unabashed affection. Jim's arm goes tenderly 
               around Muriel's waist. Smith looks back at the house.

               WHAT HE SEES - THE OLD HACKETT PLACE.

               WHAT HE SEES - The Old Hackett Place. The

                                        $9,000.00

               is quickly replaced by:

                                        $11,000.00

               GROUP SHOT.

               GROUP SHOT.

                                     SMITH
                              (brightly)
                         Shall we go up and take a look at 
                         her?

                                     MURIEL
                              (a little too casual)
                         Well -- I -- suppose as long as we're 
                         here...

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         I guess it doesn't hurt to take a 
                         look.

               As Smith precedes them up the path toward the house:

                                     MURIEL
                              (sotto)
                         It does have possibilities. Do you 
                         think we can get it?

                                     JIM
                              (sotto)
                         Like taking candy from a baby.

                                     MURIEL
                              (same)
                         Now don't lose your head.

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         Shh. Just keep quiet and let me handle 
                         this.

               As they enter the house:

                                     JIM
                         Tell me, Smith, what kind of a price 
                         is the owner asking for this old 
                         place?

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY

               Jim and Muriel precede Smith as they exit from the house. As 
               Jim and Muriel carry on a sotto voce conversation, Smith 
               looks off with some concern in the direction of the road.

                                     MURIEL
                         It's wonderful, Jim! That master 
                         bedroom with those two closets!

                                     JIM
                         Shh!

                                     MURIEL
                         Funkhauser could do wonders with 
                         this --

                                     JIM
                              (firmly)
                         Funkhauser will have nothing to do 
                         with this house! Shh!

               Smith's face suddenly brightens as a weatherbeaten old car 
               appears, turns up the driveway, stops.

                                     HACKETT
                              (calling)
                         Hi, George!

                                     SMITH
                         Hi, Eph!
                              (to the Blandings; 
                              feigned surprise)
                         What do you know, it's Eph Hackett, 
                         owner of the place!

                                     JIM
                              (pleased)
                         Well, you don't say.

               Eph Hackett gets out of the car, saunters over. Hackett is a 
               middle-aged, rural-looking, taciturn New Englander

                                     SMITH
                         Eph, this is Mr. and Mrs. Blandings -- 
                         from New York City.

                                     HACKETT
                         Howdy.

                                     THE BLANDINGS
                         How do you do?

                                     MURIEL
                         You certainly have a lovely place 
                         here, Mr. Hackett.

                                     HACKETT
                              (briefly)
                         Ye-ap.

                                     JIM
                              (pleasantly)
                         Mr. Hackett, we've just been talking 
                         to Smith here about -- uh -- taking 
                         the old place off your hands.

               Hackett exchanges the briefest of looks with Smith who almost 
               imperceptibly shakes his head "no."

                                     HACKETT
                              (firmly)
                         Ain't for sale!

               As the Blandings react with dismay:

                                     SMITH
                              (smoothly)
                         Why don't you folks just go out in 
                         back and take a look at the orchard?

               He gives them a wink which says, "Just leave it to me." The 
               Blandings exchange a look, turn and walk off.

                                     HACKETT
                         How'm I doin', George?

                                     SMITH
                         Nice timin', Eph. Think we got 
                         something here.

                                     HACKETT
                         They the same people you showed it 
                         to in nineteen-thirty-eight?

                                     SMITH
                         They were lookers -- this is the 
                         real thing.

                                     HACKETT
                         If they got five thousand dollars on 
                         'em. don't let 'em get away.

                                     SMITH
                         They already offered ten.

                                     HACKETT
                              (mildly)
                         Y'don't say... What's my asking price?

                                     SMITH
                         Fifteen...

                                     HACKETT
                         A mite stiff...

                                     SMITH
                         I've got 'em measured.
                              (mellower)
                         They're gonna take the place for --
                              (turns, looks back at 
                              house)
                         eleven thousand.

                                     HACKETT
                         Make it eleven thousand five hundred 
                         fifty.

                                     SMITH
                         Odd kind of figure.

                                     HACKETT
                         Might as well take the commission 
                         out of them instead of me.

               As Smith raises a knowing eyebrow:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

               Muriel and the two children are having breakfast. Jim enters 
               in high spirits. During this scene we repeat the business of 
               passing, etc. used in the previous breakfast scene.

                                     JIM
                              (singing gaily to 
                              "Home On The Range")
                         "Home, home in Connecticut With a 
                         closet to hang up your petticut..."

                                     MURIEL
                              (as he seats himself)
                         ...Jim?

                                     JIM
                              (going on, as he places 
                              his napkin in his 
                              lap)
                         "No hustle or fuss No Fifth Avenue 
                         bus --"

                                     MURIEL
                         Uh -- Jim?

                                     JIM
                         Hm?

                                     MURIEL
                         I was just wondering, dear. Ten 
                         thousand dollars is such an awful 
                         lot to offer --

               Jim looks suspiciously at her, at the children, then back at 
               her.

                                     MURIEL
                         That is, for two people who don't 
                         know anything at all about real 
                         estate, or anything...
                              (Jim's look darkens)
                         I mean, don't you think perhaps we 
                         should have asked someone's 
                         professional advice?

                                     JIM
                         Like... say... a lawyer?

                                     MURIEL
                         Well, Bill knows about these things 
                         and --

                                     JIM
                         Muriel, for once in my life I'm going 
                         to make one small decision, on my 
                         own, without the legalistic 
                         machinations of Mr. Bill Cole.

                                     MURIEL
                         It seems very peculiar that when 
                         your very best friend happens to be 
                         one of the very cleverest young

                         Muriel, I don't want to hear another 
                         word about Bill Cole!
                              (turns to children)
                         Well, did your mother tell you about 
                         the house?

                                     BETSY
                         Yes.

                         Miss Stellwagon says the current 
                         craze for modernizing old farmhouses 
                         is a form of totem worship.

                                     JIM
                              (with great restraint)
                         Did it ever occur to you two that 
                         there may be some remote, intangible 
                         subjects upon which your Miss Irma 
                         Stellwagon is not the final authority?

                         Why don't we buy a Solaxion house?

                                     JIM
                         ...You know it's just barely 
                         conceivable -- What kind of a house?

                                     JOAN
                         Solaxion. It's built on a mast like 
                         a tent and it revolves with the sun.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, it... revolves... with the sun?

                                     JOAN
                         That's right.

                         It's the only practical way to live. 
                         When a new model comes out you trade 
                         the old one in like a used car.

                         Children, you haven't even seen this 
                         house yet.

                         Personally, I'd like a Crane Mobile 
                         home. It comes all folded up and all 
                         you do is plug it in for electricity 
                         and water and --

                         Now just a minute!
                              (to Muriel)
                         What kind of children are these?
                              (to girls)
                         Do you want to spend the rest of 
                         your lives in chromium tents and 
                         portable merry-go-rounds? This house 
                         was built before our country became 
                         a nation. It has dignity. It's --

                              excitement)
                         From Smith!

               As he eagerly opens it and reads, his face falls.

                                     JIM
                         Mm.

                         thousand dollars to Mr. Hackett and

                         Oh, dear. Maybe we should have gone 
                         a few dollars higher.

                                     JIM
                              (stoutly)
                         He's bluffing. Simple as that.

                                     JOAN
                         For ten thousand dollars we could 
                         get a Rockford Trailer and a Zamboni 
                         Power Unit. It's kitchen, bathroom 
                         and air conditioning all rolled up

               Jim gives her a weary look, turns to Muriel.

                                     JIM
                              (firmly)
                         Muriel, I'll let him push me to ten 
                         thousand, two hundred, but not a 
                         penny more!

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               JIM'S COST CHART

               INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Rising diagonally and bisecting 
               the chart is a line graduated in scale starting at $5000 and 
               running up to around $17,000. Resting on the line at exactly 
               $10,000 is a miniature of the old house. Fluttering across 
               the scene from left to right is a letter from Smith on the 
               stationery of the Lansdale Realty Co.

               As we see the letter and hear the voice of Smith, miniature 
               figures of Smith and Hackett appear at the lower side of the 
               house. Their shoulders start pushing the house up the 
               graduated scale. Over this:

                                     SMITH'S VOICE
                         "Dear Mr. Blandings: While your offer 
                         of ten thousand two hundred is still 
                         not acceptable to Ephemus Hackett --
                         "

               A letter on Danton & Bascomb's stationery flutters across 
               the screen from right to left. A miniature figure of Jim 
               appears above the house, desperately pushing it back. Over 
               this, we hear:

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         "Dear Mr. Smith: You may inform Mr. 
                         Hackett that the very highest I could 
                         possibly go --"

               As a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first 
               from left to right and then from right to left, and the house 
               is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the 
               following lines:

                                     SMITH'S VOICE
                         "Dear Friend Blandings --"

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         "My dear Friend Smith --"

                                     SMITH'S VOICE
                         "Dear Blandings --!"

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         "Dear Smith - !"

               Throughout this Smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed 
               while Jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man 
               being slowly pushed to the wall.

               The Special Effect concludes with the house finally and firmly 
               at rest on the preordained $11,550. As the antagonists on 
               both sides of the house relax, Smith reaches around in front 
               of the house and shakes hands with Jim. It's a deal!

               About halfway through when the going gets tough, Jim beckons 
               Muriel to help in the losing fight. As they now embrace, 
               Smith and Hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               DOOR

               Door - on it is printed:

                                         MR. COLE
                                         PRIVATE

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. BILL COLE'S OFFICE - DAY

               A successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leather-
               bound books. Jim and Muriel are seated facing the large desk 
               behind which sits Bill Cole. Bill finishes reading a series 
               of papers, the sum total of correspondence between Jim and 
               Mr. Smith. He sets down the papers, leans back thoughtfully. 
               Jim and Muriel look at him with nervous but eager 
               anticipation.

                                     JIM
                              (not too sure)
                         What do you think, Bill? Steal, huh?

                                     BILL
                              (drily)
                         It certainly is.

               Jim looks triumphantly at Muriel.

                                     BILL
                         Perhaps "steal" is an understatement -- 
                         "swindle" might be a little more 
                         appropriate.

                                     JIM
                              (with pride)
                         Well, it wasn't much, Bill. I just 
                         saw a good thing and I --
                              (take)
                         What do you mean?

                                     BILL
                         Every time you get a little tight 
                         you weep on my shoulder about the 
                         advertising business and how it forces 
                         a sensitive soul like yourself to 
                         make a living by bamboozling the 
                         American public.
                              (picks up Smith's 
                              correspondence)
                         I would say that a small part of 
                         this victimized group has now 
                         redressed the balance.

                                     JIM
                         What are you talking about?

                                     BILL
                         You! You've been taken to the cleaners 
                         and you don't even know your pants 
                         are off!

                                     MURIEL
                         Dear, I told you. I said we should 
                         call Bill --

                                     JIM
                         Never mind, Muriel!
                              (to Bill; challengingly)
                         All right, just what's wrong with 
                         this deal?

                                     BILL
                         First time around you offered ten 
                         thousand dollars for fifty acres, 
                         right?

                                     JIM
                         What of it?

                                     BILL
                         That's two hundred dollars an acre. 
                         I know that part of Connecticut and 
                         one hundred dollars an acre is 
                         standard top-gouge price to city 
                         slickers. When the natives sell to 
                         each other it's around forty or less.

                                     MURIEL
                         Forty dollars an acre!

                                     JIM
                         The man's entitled to a fair profit.

                                     BILL
                         Not two hundred and eighty-four 
                         percent.
                              (indicates papers)
                         And besides, you're not getting fifty 
                         acres, you're only getting thirty-
                         five, more or less.

                                     JIM
                         Where does it say that?

                         I refer to a rather obscure post-
                         script on the back of the second 
                         letter from Friend Smith.

               He hands the letter to Muriel.

                         somewhere in the neighborhood of 
                         thirty-five acres, more or less, but 
                         I feel sure..."

                                     JIM
                              (on the defensive)
                         All right, so it's thirty-five! What's 
                         the difference? Do you know how many 
                         tennis courts you can get on thirty-
                         five acres?

                                     BILL
                         You're not spending eleven thousand 
                         five hundred dollars for tennis 
                         courts!

                                     JIM
                         That's not the point!

                                     BILL
                              (very businesslike)
                         That's precisely the point. We're 
                         going to write this Hackett a strong 
                         letter and tell him he can either 
                         kick in with those fifteen acres, 
                         reduce the price, or find another 
                         sucker.

                                     JIM
                              (rising emotion)
                         We'll do no such thing! I'm not going 
                         to queer this deal over fifteen broken-
                         down acres!

                                     MURIEL
                              (to Bill)
                         We were just going window shopping 
                         and so far it's cost us eleven 
                         thousand five hundred dollars and 
                         they even made us pay the commission!

                                     JIM
                         You don't understand business.

                                     BILL
                         You mean extortion.

               As Jim turns on Bill and is about to answer him explosively:

                                     MURIEL
                              (thoughtfully)
                         I wonder if we could get another two 
                         year lease on the apartment?

                                     JIM
                              (heatedly)
                         Now wait a minute! You can't measure 
                         everything on a slide rule. This 
                         house has certain intangibles.

                                     BILL
                         Like what, for instance?

                                     JIM
                         Like antique value, for instance! It 
                         just so happens that General Gates 
                         stopped right there, at that very 
                         house, to water his horses.

                                     BILL
                         I don't care if General Grant dropped 
                         in for a scotch and soda -- you're 
                         still getting rocked!

                                     JIM
                         That was a different war!

                                     MURIEL
                         I think Bill's absolutely right.

                                     JIM
                              (struggling to contain 
                              himself; quietly)
                         Let me explain something. To both of 
                         you. For fifteen years I've been 
                         cooped up in a four room cracker 
                         box! Just getting shaved in the 
                         morning entitles a man to the 
                         Congressional Medal for bravery.

                                     BILL
                         That doesn't make this a good buy.

                                     JIM
                         Bill -- Muriel and I have found what 
                         I am not ashamed to call our Dream 
                         House. It's like a fine painting. 
                         You buy it with your heart, not your 
                         head. You don't ask, how much was 
                         the canvas, how much was the paint? 
                         You look at it and you say, "It's 
                         beautiful... I want it," and if it 
                         costs a few pennies more you pay it -- 
                         and gladly -- because you love it 
                         and you can't measure the things you 
                         love in dollars and cents!

               Muriel looks at Jim, impressed, her face softening with 
               compassion.

                                     JIM
                              (emotionally spent)
                         Well -- that's how I feel about this 
                         place. And when I sign those papers 
                         Saturday, I can look the world in 
                         the face and say, "It's mine! My 
                         house! My home! My thirty-five acres!"

                                     MURIEL
                              (coming over; moved, 
                              touched)
                         Our house. Our home. Our thirty-five 
                         acres...

               They tenderly kiss.

                                     BILL
                         ...more or less...

               On Jim's reaction:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. RECORDS ROOM LANSDALE COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

               Old Judge Quarles is reading from the title deed, the 
               proceedings almost over. Jim stands in front of the bench 
               flanked by Muriel and Bill. Mr. Smith and Hackett are the 
               only other people present. As the Judge drones on, Jim and 
               Muriel exchange a smile. Jim squeezes her hand intimately.

                                     JUDGE QUARLES
                              (reading)
                         "...thence along said stonewall fence 
                         forming the East boundary of said 
                         Lansdale Road, N 20° 27' E, 21.84 
                         feet to the end of said stonewall 
                         fence, thence along a wire fence, N 
                         16° 31' W, 78.66 feet to a dead twenty-
                         inch chestnut tree, thence westward 
                         to said stonewall fence, to a total 
                         of thirty-one and a half acres --"

                                     JIM
                              (reacting)
                         What was that? How many acres?

               Judge Quarles looks up impatiently at the interruption.

                                     BILL
                              (precisely)
                         Thirty-one and a half.

                                     JIM
                              (to Hackett)
                         I was under the impression your 
                         property was thirty-five acres, Mr. 
                         Hackett.

                                     HACKETT
                         It is... more or less.

               Bill looks significantly at Jim.

                                     SMITH
                         You see, Mr. Blandings, when you 
                         signed the purchase agreement it was 
                         subject to traced map attached. 
                         Surveyed to an even thirty-one and a 
                         half acres.

               Jim turns to Bill for affirmation. Bill soberly nods his 
               head, "yes."

                                     JUDGE QUARLES
                         Anything wrong?

                                     BILL
                         It's nothing, Your Honor, just a few 
                         less tennis courts.

               Jim gives Bill a sour look as the Judge continues:

                                     JUDGE QUARLES
                              (with ministerial 
                              resonance)
                         "...to have and to hold to him, the 
                         said Grantee, his heirs and assigns 
                         to his and their own proper use and 
                         benefit forever."

               During this, and as a shaft of sunlight hits them, a beatific 
               look comes across the faces of Jim and Muriel. For a moment 
               it has become their wedding day. After a momentary pause:

                                     JUDGE QUARLES
                              (very businesslike)
                         Subject to a six thousand dollar 
                         mortgage held by Ephemus Whittaker 
                         Hackett...

               As the Blandings are startled back to grim reality:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. RURAL COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

               LONG SHOT - The Blandings' car. The Blandings and Bill Cole 
               driving along. They approach a fork in the road which leads 
               to a very old covered New England bridge. On the bridge is a 
               sign which reads:

                                       SHRUNK MILLS
                                          2 Mi.

               They pause, turn, go through the bridge.

               INT. THE CAR - (PROCESS)

               As they drive through the dark interior of the bridge there 
               is an appropriate rattling and rumbling of the ancient 
               timbers.

               EXT. THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE

               There is another fork in the road. Muriel points to the road 
               to the right. Jim shakes his head, points to the road to the 
               left. Muriel points to the right. Jim emphatically shakes 
               his head, puts the car in gear, drives off on the road to 
               the left.

               LONG SHOT - THE CAR

               LONG SHOT - the car. It goes up to the top of a hill, stops, 
               starts up, disappears.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. A ROAD - DAY

               As the car approaches, the CAMERA discloses it is back at 
               the same covered bridge. The car stops.

               INT. THE CAR

               Jim reacts with annoyance, mops his brow.

                                     BILL
                              (drily)
                         Congress ought to pass a law. When a 
                         man buys a house in Lansdale County 
                         there's a prize -- he gets ten percent 
                         off if he can find it.

               EXT. THE BRIDGE

               Jim backs up and, over Muriel's protestation that they go 
               right, turns the car left.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               LONG SHOT - THE CAR

               LONG SHOT - the car. It drives up an empty road, disappears.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. A ROAD - DAY

               As the car approaches, the CAMERA reveals it is again back 
               at the old covered bridge. The sign still reads: "SHRUNK 
               MILLS - 2 Mi."

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Jim and Muriel look at each other with disgust and 
               resignation.

                                     JIM
                         What in the world are "Shrunk Mills?"

                                     BILL
                         They are probably mills that have 
                         shrunk.

                                     MURIEL
                         Well, you certainly aren't much of a 
                         help.

                                     BILL
                              (wearily)
                         Look -- you really want to find that 
                         house of yours -- it's no problem.

               They look at him curiously.

                                     BILL
                         Just pretend you're one of General 
                         Gates' horses and you're thirsty... 
                         Now where would you go for a drink 
                         of water?

               Jim looks at him darkly, drives through the bridge, turns 
               right, as Muriel looks slightly triumphant.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - DAY

               Jim, Muriel and Bill stand a little distance from the house, 
               looking at it. A vast lilac spreads across it. The Blandings 
               are in quiet rapture, and it is Bill who speaks first.

                                     BILL
                              (frank and open)
                         Well, I must admit it's a very 
                         beautiful thing.

                                     MURIEL
                              (misty)
                         The house and the lilac are just the 
                         same age, Bill; if the lilac can 
                         live and be so old, so can the house. 
                         It just needs someone to love it, 
                         that's all.

               Three shingles slide from the roof. As Jim and Muriel react:

                                     BILL
                         It's a good thing there are two of 
                         you -- one to love it and one to 
                         hold it up.

               As Jim gives him a look:

                                     BILL
                         What'd your engineer say when he 
                         checked over the foundation and that 
                         roof?

                                     JIM
                         Who needs engineers? This isn't a 
                         train, you know.

                                     BILL
                         I just saw it move.

                                     JIM
                         This house has been standing since 
                         the second year of the Continental 
                         Congress. You take one look at it 
                         and shingles start to fall off!

               As if on cue, a few more shingles slide off the roof, nearly 
               hitting Jim.

                                     BILL
                              (solicitously)
                         Look -- let me do you a favor. I've 
                         got a client, crackerjack structural 
                         engineer, Joe Apollonio; he 
                         practically built the George 
                         Washington Bridge single-handed.

                                     JIM
                         Thanks a lot, but we're not building 
                         a bridge.

                                     BILL
                         He's the follow who advised the 
                         Government not to raise the Normandie -- 
                         they didn't listen to him, cost them 
                         five million dollars.

                                     JIM
                         You have my word, if I were raising 
                         the Normandie, I wouldn't make a 
                         move without Apollonio.
                              (indicates door)
                         Now would you like to come inside 
                         and look around?

                                     BILL
                              (a skeptical look at 
                              the roof)
                         No thanks, I'll just stay out in the 
                         car and listen to "Life Can Be 
                         Beautiful."

               As Jim opens the door and disappears, there is a crash, 
               followed by a series of other crashes. Muriel looks in, turns 
               back to Bill.

                                     MURIEL
                         I think you'd better contact Mr. 
                         Apollonio.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE OLD HACKETT PLACE - DAY

               Near the front entrance. After a moment, the door opens, and 
               the Blandings and Mr. Apollonio emerge. Jim, limping, is 
               aided and abetted by a cane. Apollonio is a stolid, New York 
               construction man, replete with derby, blue serge suit, and 
               cigar. A short rule sticks out of a back pocket. As they 
               emerge, the Blandings are hopefully enthusiastic; Apollonio 
               is thoughtfully noncommittal.

                                     MURIEL
                         It has charm, hasn't it, Mr. 
                         Apollonio?

                                     APOLLONIO
                              (through his cigar)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     JIM
                         Of course, any small changes would 
                         have to conform with the character 
                         of the countryside.

                                     APOLLONIO
                              (through his cigar)
                         Mm-hmm.

                                     MURIEL
                         And yet still be functional.

               Apollonio casually walks over to the corner of the house, 
               kicks an exposed beam. It crumbles, apparently rotted by 
               termites. Two shingles fall off. The Blandings watch him 
               anxiously.

                                     APOLLONIO
                              (gazing upward; 
                              oblivious)
                         Uh-huh.

               As he thoughtfully rubs his chin, Jim, followed by Muriel, 
               limps his way over to him.

                                     JIM
                         Well, uh, what's your professional 
                         opinion?

               Apollonio looks at the Blandings, at the house, then back at 
               the Blandings. He takes the cigar from his mouth.

                                     APOLLONIO
                         Tear it down.

                                     JIM
                              (appalled)
                         Tear it down??!

                                     APOLLONIO
                         If your chimney was shot and your 
                         sills was okay, I'd say go ahead, 
                         fix her up. If your sills was shot 
                         and your chimney was okay, again I'd 
                         say go ahead, fix her up. But your 
                         sills are shot and your chimney is 
                         shot.

               During this speech Apollonio picks up a wooden frame, squares 
               it with a pocket square, levels it on a fence, and looks 
               through it at the house.

                                     APOLLONIO
                              (beckoning)
                         Take a look at the way she sags.

               The Blandings step over, look through the frame.

               WHAT THEY SEE.

               What they see. Outlined against the frame, the house slants, 
               sagging perceptibly.

                                     APOLLONIO
                         So I say don't throw good money after 
                         bad -- tear it down.

                                     JIM
                              (coolly)
                         Thanks a lot.

                                     APOLLONIO
                         It's okay.

               He tips his hat, walks out of scene.

                         Tear it down.

               The Blandings look at each other.

                         On the other hand, Mr. Murphy said --

                         I think you'd better tear it down.

               The Blandings smile feebly.

               The Blandings are now considerably shaken.

               A SHINGLE.

               A shingle. It reads in neat, conservative lettering:

               INT. HENRY L. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Jim, Muriel, Simms. The room is in quiet, good taste, a 
               flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window 
               seats, etc. The walls are crammed with books and photographs 
               of Simms' handiwork. There are a couple of gold medal 
               citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room.

               Simms is a tweedy, pipe-smoking, conservative New Englander, 
               a distinguished-looking local architect. He puffs thoughtfully 
               on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old Hackett 
               place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the 
               window frame.

                         Of course you could fix up that old 
                         house. You can fix up any structure 
                         that's still standing. The sills and 
                         floors couldn't be worse, I grant 
                         you, and I guess you'd have to jack 
                         up that west corner at least three 
                         feet to make it level. Need new 
                         chimney. New roof. Complete new 
                         plumbing.
                              (sigh)
                         Too bad you didn't buy it ten years 
                         ago. Could have fixed it up in jig 
                         time then, and it would have made 
                         some sense.

                         Fact is, before you're through, it 
                         would be less expensive to tear the 
                         old place down and build a new one, 
                         same size.

                         Mm. New house...
                              (as the notion sinks 
                              in, becomes attractive)
                         New house.

                                     MURIEL
                              (to Simms, with 
                              pleasant incredulity)
                         You mean... for the same money... we 
                         could build a brand new house?

                                     SIMMS
                         It certainly wouldn't cost any more.

                                     JIM
                              (soberly)
                         Hm... New house...

               He turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an 
               interested eyebrow. Then, to Simms:

                                     JIM
                              (tentatively)
                         Just... what sort of thing do you 
                         have in mind?

                                     SIMMS
                         Well, I imagine the type of house 
                         you'd want would be something in 
                         quiet good taste, two story, frame 
                         and brick veneer construction -- 
                         modern, but of course fitting in 
                         with the architectural traditions of 
                         the countryside.

                                     JIM
                         Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel?

                                     MURIEL
                         I think it sounds fine.

                                     SIMMS
                         Perhaps you'd like to see a basic 
                         floor plan --
                              (reaches into file 
                              behind him)
                         -- something like this.

               Simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him, 
               the Blandings moving around, flanking him. They examine the 
               plan with interest.

               WHAT THEY SEE -- THE PLAN.

               What they see -- the plan. A simple master plan of a two 
               story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. As he 
               talks, we see Simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the 
               various rooms

                                     SIMMS
                         First floor. Living room, study, 
                         dining room, kitchen, service porch, 
                         maid's room -- upstairs three family 
                         bedrooms with two adjoining baths.

               THREE SHOT. THE BLANDINGS PRAISE THE PLAN

               THREE SHOT. The Blandings praise the plan with the 
               uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen 
               such a plan before in their lives.

                                     MURIEL
                         It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh -- 
                         well -- doesn't it seem just a little 
                         bit conventional?

                                     JIM
                         Yes, Simms, if we were going to build 
                         a house we want it -- well, you know -- 
                         just a little bit different.

                                     SIMMS
                              (he's heard all this 
                              before)
                         Yes, of course.

                                     JIM
                         Now, for instance --
                              (takes Simms' pencil)

               THE DRAWING BOARD.

               THE DRAWING BOARD. Jim's pencil traces as he talks.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         -- here in the study if we could 
                         just push out this wall a little -- 
                         and put in a built-in bar we could --

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                         Excuse me, dear --

               Her hand takes the pencil from his, starts to trace as she 
               talks. Jim's fingers drum with the beginnings of impatience.

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                         These bedrooms. They do seem rather 
                         small. And, of course we'd have to 
                         have a little dressing room -- and --

               As she draws it in, Jim's hand takes the pencil. Muriel's 
               fingers drum nervously.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         And closets, Simms, lots of closets.
                              (traces them in)
                         If there's one thing this family 
                         needs, it's closets.

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                              (as his hand reaches 
                              for the pencil)
                         If I might make a suggestion --

               But Muriel's hand reaches the pencil first.

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                              (as she draws them in)
                         And bathrooms, Mr. Simms. Each bedroom 
                         must have at least one bathroom.

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                         But that would be four bathrooms, 
                         Mrs. Blandings --
                              (his hand reaches for 
                              the pencil)
                         I think I'd better point out to you --

               Jim's hand reaches the pencil before Simms. Now Simms' fingers 
               and Muriel's drum in unison.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         Just a minute. Do you think --
                              (tracing)
                         we might manage a little playroom in 
                         the basement, nothing tremendous, 
                         you know, something like this --

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                              (as his hand reaches 
                              for the pencil; 
                              cautiously)
                         Well, it's always possible, but at 
                         the moment our fundamental problem --

               But Muriel's hand has the pencil.

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                              (as she traces)
                         And I've always wanted a little sewing 
                         room upstairs --
                              (Jim's and Simms' 
                              fingers drum 
                              impatiently)
                         You know, a little utility room where 
                         I can be alone, and sew, or sulk, or 
                         on a rainy afternoon...

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                              (as his hand takes 
                              pencil)
                         Pardon me, dear. On that playroom, 
                         Simms, not too small. You know, plenty 
                         of room for ping-pong, darts, nice 
                         big poker table...

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                              (as his hand reaches 
                              for another pencil)
                         If you don't mind, I --

               But Muriel has reached the pencil first. As she and Jim sketch 
               simultaneously and the scene begins to DISSOLVE, we hear:

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                         ...And off the kitchen, I'd like a 
                         little flower sink just to putter 
                         around in...

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         ...And a terrace off the study, with 
                         an owning and little outdoor 
                         fireplace...

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               THE DRAWING BOARD - THE ORIGINAL PLANS

               THE DRAWING BOARD - The original plans are lost in a maze of 
               the Blandings' extensions, alterations and additions.

               THREE SHOT - THE THREE ARE SOMEWHAT EXHAUSTED

               THREE SHOT - The three are somewhat exhausted, silently 
               looking at the plans. Simms wearily runs his hand through 
               his hair.

                                     SIMMS
                              (delicately)
                         We-ll... let's just see what we have 
                         here. In the first place --

               THE DRAWING BOARD - SIMMS'

               THE DRAWING BOARD - Simms' pencil indicates as he talks.

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                         -- I'm afraid you've got the upstairs 
                         about twice as big as the downstairs.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         It's all those bathrooms.

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                         It is not, it's all those closets.

               THREE SHOT.

               THREE SHOT.

                                     SIMMS
                         By extending this breakfast room 
                         you've eliminated the possibility of 
                         any stairs going to the second floor.

                                     JIM
                         Oh, you can just shove those stairs 
                         in anywhere.

                                     SIMMS
                              (patiently; almost 
                              paternally)
                         And, Mrs. Blandings, on that sewing 
                         room, the way you have it now, the 
                         chimney stack would come up right 
                         through the middle of the room, 
                         leaving you with something in the 
                         shape of a square doughnut.
                              (tactfully)
                         Which, of course, might be very warm 
                         in winter, but otherwise of doubtful 
                         utility.

                                     MURIEL
                         You could always move the chimney 
                         somewhere else, couldn't you?

                                     SIMMS
                         We-ll...
                              (rising; resigned to 
                              his fate but tactful)
                         Look, I think I know just about what 
                         you two have in mind. Why don't I go 
                         ahead with some preliminary plans 
                         and --

                                     JIM
                              (hearty)
                         You do that, Simms, but remember, 
                         we've got to hold it down to ten 
                         thousand.

                                     SIMMS
                              (candid)
                         That, I can tell you right now, is 
                         impossible. Even with a considerable 
                         trimming of the things you've 
                         indicated, I don't see how we can 
                         bring it in for less than twelve or 
                         twelve-five.

                                     JIM
                         Twelve-five!
                              (looks at Muriel; 
                              then)
                         Well, I guess we're not going to 
                         quibble about a few pennies one way 
                         or the other.

                                     MURIEL
                              (can't resist)
                         No, you'll find Mr. Blandings never 
                         quibbles about pennies.

                                     SIMMS
                         And -- uh -- have you any notions 
                         about how you'd like the old place 
                         taken down?

                                     JIM
                              (a rueful joke)
                         Why don't we just blow on it?

                                     SIMMS
                              (wry smile)
                         There's a good local house wrecker. 
                         I'll have him contact you.

               Jim expansively puts his arm around Simms' shoulders.

                                     JIM
                         Fine. You just shoot ahead with those 
                         plans, and remember, try to keep it 
                         down to ten, ten-five.

                         There's one good thing about getting 
                         that old relic down. Those original 
                         beams and everything -- this time 
                         somebody pays us.

               MATTE SHOT)

               Old Hackett house matted to show winter sky, bare trees. In 
               the f.g. bare ground with patches of snow.

               Eph Hackett is standing with one of the wreckers. In the 
               b.g. we see the frame of the old house, firmly intact, the 
               chimney still standing within it. There are mountains of 
               shingles, splintered boards and other rubbish, piled about. 
               The piles are reasonably neat and sorted.

                                     HACKETT
                         Them beams is worth money. You payin' 
                         him, or he payin' you?

                                     WRECKER
                         He's payin' me.

                         How much?

                                     WRECKER
                              (hesitating)
                         A thousand.

                         A thousand!

                         He squawked, but he paid.

                         Hmm. I guess maybe I got a little 
                         somethin' comin' too.

               Jim, Muriel and Simms are going over the preliminary plans. 
               Betsy and Joan are present, Betsy reading the Lansdale Blade

                         It's impossible. I don't see how we 
                         can cut another inch.

                         Honey, you heard Simms. As the house 
                         stands now it's over fifteen thousand 
                         dollars!

                              (afterthought)
                         for a house with such small rooms.

                         Mrs. Blandings, I've already 
                         explained. It's not only the size of 
                         the rooms so much as it is the number. 
                         You see, our primary problem is one 
                         of cubage --

                                     JIM
                         That's right, dear, cubage.

                              (sorry he got into it)
                         just a figure of speech.

                                     MURIEL
                         But what does it mean?

                              (a little irritably)
                         Cubage. It's just the number of cubic 
                         feet that --
                              (lost, lamely)
                         -- go into a cubic foot. Go on, Simms.

                              (consulting plans)
                         Now is it absolutely essential for 
                         each of your daughters to have her 
                         own room with two closets and a 
                         separate bath?

                         I hadn't realized they were 
                         approaching it quite so fast.
                              (to Jim)
                         Perhaps what you need is not so much 
                         a house as a series of little 
                         bungalows.

                                     JIM
                         Hmmm.
                              (examining plans)
                         What about that silly flower sink? 
                         We could eliminate that.

                                     MURIEL
                         I beg your pardon.

                         Or that sewing room upstairs, that's 
                         certainly a waste.

                                     MURIEL
                         If we're going to eliminate anything, 
                         we'll lose that ridiculous play room 
                         in the basement with that great big 
                         poker table.

                         relaxation.

                         gardening.

                         Sure, and get poison ivy!

                         If I may interrupt, I'd like to 
                         suggest that none of these are really 
                         major eliminations. Now if we could 
                         do with one less bathroom on the 
                         second floor --

                                     MURIEL
                         I'm sorry. We couldn't possibly.

                                     SIMMS
                         Mrs. Blandings, a simple bathroom, 
                         eight by ten by eight with grade A 
                         fixtures will cost around thirteen 
                         hundred dollars.

                                     MURIEL
                         I refuse to endanger the health of 
                         my children in a house with less 
                         than four bathrooms.

                         For thirteen hundred dollars they 
                         can live in a house with three 
                         bathrooms and rough it!

                         thing would be --

                         Muriel, isn't it time for those 
                         children to be in bed?

                                     MURIEL
                         Now girls, I don't want to tell you 
                         again.

               The front doorbell rings.

                                     MURIEL
                         Excuse me.

               As the CAMERA FOLLOWS Muriel to the door, we hear:

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         Twenty-six hundred dollars!

                              (comfortingly)
                         I wouldn't be too concerned about 
                         Mrs. Prutty and her committee. After 
                         all, it's your property and if you 
                         want to tear it down --

               Muriel opens the door, admits an excited Bill Cole.

                                     MURIEL
                              (surprised)
                         Why, Bill!

                         Hello, Muriel.
                              (he strides past her 
                              waving a telegram;

                         Well, you've done it again'. Once, 
                         just once, why don't you come to me 
                         and find out if it's all right, if 
                         it's legal, before you go barging 
                         off and run yourself smack into 
                         another jam!

                         equally responsible!

                         I quite agree. But you're dealing 
                         with a man who doesn't think before 
                         he acts, who goes off half-cocked!

                         You knew there was a mortgage on 
                         that house.

                         I assumed as much.

                         What happened? What are you talking

                              Simms)
                         And you know the requirements in 
                         regard to a mortgage where there's 
                         demolition intended!

                                     SIMMS
                         Certainly. But since you were his 
                         lawyer, I naturally assumed --

                                     BILL
                         With a man like this you can't assume 
                         anything!

                         Just one minute! I am entitled to 
                         know what I did! This is America! A

                         Bill, I've had a very trying day. 
                         Would you mind telling me in clear, 
                         concise English just what crime I've 
                         committed -- and why?!

                              (with weary resignation)
                         In clear, concise English, you tore 
                         down a house on which another man 
                         holds a mortgage without first getting 
                         his written permission.

                         And in such case, the mortgagee can 
                         demand the full payment of said 
                         mortgage upon demand --

                         and Mr. Ephemus Hackett so demands! 
                         Six thousand clams! And he wants 
                         them now!

                         Now?!

                                     BILL
                         You've got ten days.

                         to bed without another word.

                         Good night, Mr. Simms. Uncle Bill.

                         the parents should be the problems 
                         of the children.

                         You keep that in mind, dear. It'll 
                         help prepare you for motherhood.

               The children exit. An embarrassed pause.

                                     SIMMS
                         Perhaps we'd better let the plans go 
                         for the time being and --

                                     JIM
                              (weakly)
                         No, Simms, I'll work this out. You 
                         go ahead with your final plans and 
                         let's see some estimates.

                                     MURIEL
                         And we'll just forget about that 
                         extra bathroom.

                                     SIMMS
                              (preparing to leave)
                         Very well. You'll hear from me as 
                         soon as possible. Good night.

               Good nights are exchanged. Muriel takes Simms out of scene 
               toward the door. CAMERA HOLDS on Bill and Jim.

                                     JIM
                              (defeated)
                         Six thousand dollars!

               Bill looks at Jim with compassion.

                                     BILL
                         What'll you do for collateral on 
                         your building loan?

                                     JIM
                         I don't know, turn in my insurance 
                         policies or something.

                                     MURIEL
                              (coming into scene)
                         Now, Jim, you can't do that.

                                     JIM
                         Why not?

                                     MURIEL
                         What if something should happen? You 
                         can't leave the children unprotected.

                                     JIM
                              (somewhat irritably)
                         I'm not dead yet! And if I die, 
                         there's plenty left to take care of 
                         them.

                                     MURIEL
                         Not if you cash in your policies.

               As Jim reacts with painful resignation:

                                     BILL
                         I'm sure it won't be necessary. I'll 
                         see the boys at the bank. Maybe you 
                         can put up your insurance as 
                         collateral. If necessary, I'll sign 
                         a personal note.

                                     JIM
                              (wearily)
                         Thanks, Bill.

                                     BILL
                              (paternally)
                         And Jim, do me a little favor. The 
                         next time you're going to do anything, 
                         or say anything, or buy anything, 
                         think it over very carefully, and 
                         when you're sure you're right -- 
                         forget the whole thing. Good night, 
                         Muriel.

               He goes to Muriel and kisses her on the cheek. Jim sees it, 
               is annoyed.

                         Good night, Bill.

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Muriel and Bill to the door. He exits. Muriel 
               comes back into the room.

                              (darkly)
                         What's with this kissing all of a 
                         sudden?

                                     MURIEL
                         What's that?

                                     JIM
                         Just because a man is helpful in a 
                         business way, it doesn't give him 
                         extra-curricular privileges with my 
                         wife!

                                     MURIEL
                         That's a fine thing to say about a 
                         friend of fifteen years!

                                     JIM
                              (testy)
                         Well, I don't like it. Every time he 
                         goes out of this house, he shakes my 
                         hand and he kisses you.

                                     MURIEL
                              (sharply)
                         Would you prefer it the other way 
                         around?!

                                     JIM
                              (irritably)
                         Well, I don't like it, that's all! 
                         Why is he always hanging around? Why 
                         doesn't he ever get married -- or 
                         something?

                                     MURIEL
                              (assumed innocence)
                         Because he can't find another girl 
                         as sweet and pretty and wholesome as 
                         I am.

                                     JIM
                         Well -- it -- it doesn't look right. 
                         There are limits to friendship and --

               Muriel comes over, puts a sympathetic arm around him.

                                     MURIEL
                         Darling, let's not be silly about 
                         this. It's not Bill, it's the house 
                         you're upset about.

                                     JIM
                              (sigh)
                         I suppose so.

               They kiss.

                                     JIM
                         Do you think it's worth all this?

                                     MURIEL
                         Of course, darling. We're not just 
                         building a house -- it's a home. A 
                         home for ourselves -- and our children -- 
                         and maybe our children's children.

                                     JIM
                              (whimsically)
                         It's getting awfully crowded with 
                         only three bathrooms.

               They look at each other, smile and kiss intimately, as we

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY

               Jim and Muriel are watching Simms, who has just taken a 
               typewritten sheet from his files. Simms looks at the sheet, 
               turns to them a little apprehensively.

                                     SIMMS
                         Well -- here are the estimates. Before 
                         you look at them, I think I'd better 
                         explain --

                                     JIM
                         Don't bother, Simms.
                              (takes the sheet)
                         I'm getting to be an old hand at 
                         this sort of --

               Jim is halfway into his chair as his eye catches the first 
               bid. There is a sharp MUSICAL EFFECT as Jim bounces out of 
               his seat.

                                     JIM
                         Jumping H. Mahogany --!!

               The CAMERA GOES IN for a CLOSE SHOT of the column of 
               estimates. As the CAMERA IRISES DOWN ON each sum, there is a 
               dissonant MUSICAL EFFECT.

               Antonio Doloroso, Builders  $32,117.00
               Caries & Plumline  $30,500.00

               THREE SHOT JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS

               THREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel, and Simms. Muriel has read the 
               column over Jim's shoulder.

                                     SIMMS
                         Now obviously these bids are way out 
                         of line, that is, all except John 
                         Retch and Son at twenty-one thousand.

                                     MURIEL
                              (reacting)
                         Twenty-one thousand!

                                     SIMMS
                         And with some judicious cutting, I 
                         think we can pare that down to 
                         eighteen.

                                     MURIEL
                         We've only asked for the barest 
                         necessities --

                                     SIMMS
                         Frankly, with all the extras you two 
                         have --

                                     JIM
                         Never mind.

                              Simms)
                         If you'll just send us a bill for 
                         your services, I'll see that it's 
                         taken care of.
                              (takes Muriel's hand 
                              and starts for door)
                         Now, if you'll excuse us.

                                     MURIEL
                         Where are we going?

                                     JIM
                         I am going out to get my head 
                         examined! Then, if I don't jump off 
                         the Brooklyn Bridge, I'm going to 
                         find the owner of our building and 
                         sign a twenty-year lease!

               As they are about to exit, they pause as their eyes are caught 
               by a drawing on an adjacent drawing board.

               WHAT THEY SEE - A BEAUTIFUL PENCIL AND CHARCOAL DRAWING

               What they see - a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of 
               their completed prospective house. Under it, in neat letters 
               is printed:

                       RESIDENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JAMES H. BLANDINGS

               JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS.

               Jim, Muriel, and Simms. They look at the drawing, then at 
               each other. Jim's face softens. Muriel looks at him 
               appealingly.

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         What's the name of that contractor?

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INSERT JIM'S COST CHART. The house rests on the diagonal 
               line at the figure of $13,500. As the miniscule Jim and Muriel 
               watch with apprehension, the small figures of Smith and 
               Hackett are joined by Simms, John W. Retch, and several sub 
               contractors, who put their collective shoulders to the house 
               and push it past the Blandings and up to $31,000.00

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXCAVATION - LOCATION #2 - EARLY SPRING - DAY

               A sign on a sawhorse - it reads:

                                  JOHN W. RETCH AND SON

               Over scene is the thunderous dissonance of the various SOUNDS 
               that go into preliminary construction. A steam shovel in 
               action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently 
               the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig.

               As the CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see the machines and workmen at 
               their various tasks. The scene has all the rustic peace of 
               the invasion of Hollandia.

               The ANGLE CHANGES, and we see Jim, Muriel, and Bill drive up 
               the improvised driveway very close to the scene of activity.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               Jim and Muriel look at their property with unconcealed pride. 
               Bill is interested but would like it better if there were 
               less noise.

                                     JIM
                              (shouting over noise)
                         Well, things are certainly humming.

                                     BILL
                              (same)
                         What's that?

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         I said, humming.

                                     BILL
                         Oh.

               As they get out of the car, there is an unusually loud crash 
               from the well-digger's rig.

                                     BILL
                              (loud)
                         What's going on over there?

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         That's Mr. Tesander. He's digging 
                         our well.

                                     BILL
                              (same)
                         Well? What happened to the trout 
                         stream, with that pure, clear, cold 
                         mountain water?

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         I decided against it --

               There is a sudden cessation of the steam shovel and complete 
               silence. Jim, unaware of it, continues to shout.

                                     JIM
                         The trout stream --
                              (reacts; quietly)
                         didn't seem practical.

                                     MURIEL
                         It wasn't exactly a decision, dear.
                              (to Bill)
                         We discovered the trout stream dries 
                         up in August and the rest of the 
                         year it's polluted.

                                     JIM
                              (defensively; groping)
                         Well, anyway, I'd rather have artesian 
                         water. It's healthier. Calcium -- 
                         vitamins -- artesian --

                                     BILL
                              (indicating)
                         What's wrong with that steam shovel?

               They look off.

               WHAT THEY SEE. A CLUSTER OF WORKMEN

               WHAT THEY SEE. A cluster of workmen have gathered around Mr. 
               Zucca, the driver of the steam shovel, who is swearing in 
               voluble but undistinguishable Italian.

               JIM, MURIEL AND BILL.

               Jim, Muriel and Bill.

                                     JIM
                         Better take a look.

               He starts off for the steam shovel, nimbly jumping over a 
               drainage trench. Muriel starts to follow, pauses, unable to 
               negotiate the trench.

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim!

               Jim turns in time to see Bill pick Muriel up and carry her 
               across the trench. As he sets her down:

                                     MURIEL
                              (sarcastic; to Jim)
                         Thank you, dear.

               Jim frowns, annoyed. They approach the group around the 
               shovel.

                                     JIM
                         What's the matter, Mr. Zucca? 
                         Something wrong?

                                     ZUCCA
                         How do you lika that? Broka my bucket. 
                         Two times this week I broka my bucket?

                                     JIM
                         What did you do, strike a boulder?

                                     ZUCCA
                              (darkly)

                         What does that mean?

                         What do you mean, dynamite?

                              (a little annoyed)
                         What do you mean, "What do you mean?" 
                         Mr. Zucca just explained. He's going 
                         to use dynamite and blast until he 
                         gets rid of the rock.

                         What Mr. Blandings means is -- what 
                         precisely is a ledge?

                                     ZUCCA
                         Ledge. Lika bigga stone, only a-
                         bigger.

                                     JIM
                         Like a boulder?

                                     ZUCCA
                         No, like ledge.

               Jim looks at Muriel and Bill.

                         ...Like a ledge.

                                     ZUCCA
                         But you don't gotta worry. Only cost 
                         twenty-four cents a cubic foot, plussa 
                         dynamite an'a fuse.

                                     JIM
                         But how far will you have to blast?

                                     ZUCCA
                         Harda tell. Might be a lilla baby 
                         ledge -- mighta run the whole toppa 
                         the mountain.

                              (appalled)
                         At twenty-four cents a foot? Do you 
                         realize what that means?!

                         Meansa we gotta blast.

               Zucca walks off.

                              (with quiet resignation)

                         Apollonio. He raised the Normandie.

               There is a crash from the well-digging rig.

                              authority)
                         I think I'd better have a little 
                         talk with Mr. Tesander.

               He starts off. Muriel and Bill, curious, follow.

               EXT. AT THE WELL RIG

               Tesander, a stolid New England well-digger, the soul of 
               industry and candor, attacks the earth. Jim, followed by 
               Muriel and Bill, walks into scene, stands by, watching him. 
               After a moment:

                                     JIM
                         Oh -- Mr. Tesander --

               The motor is making too much noise.

                                     JIM
                              (louder)
                         Mr. Tesander!

               Tesander looks up, shuts off his motor.

                                     TESANDER
                         Yep?

                                     JIM
                         How's it coming?

                                     TESANDER
                              (considers a moment; 
                              then:)
                         It's comin'.

               With a nod he turns on his motor, resumes work. Jim exchanges 
               a look with Muriel and Bill.

                                     JIM
                         No -- no -- I mean --

               But he's drowned out by the motor.

                                     JIM
                              (shouts)
                         Mr. Tesander!

               Tesander patiently stops his motor, looks up.

                                     TESANDER
                         Yep?

                                     JIM
                         What I meant was -- how far down are 
                         you?

               Tesander looks at his equipment, considers.

                                     TESANDER
                         Oh -- 'bout a hundred and ninety 
                         feet.

                                     JIM
                         Well -- isn't that pretty deep?

                                     TESANDER
                              (thinks it over; he's 
                              not one for snap 
                              judgments; then:)
                         Yep.

               He's about to turn on his motor, but Jim detains him.

                                     JIM
                         Do you think maybe you'd better try 
                         another spot?

                                     TESANDER
                         Up to you.

                                     JIM
                         I mean -- well, have you hit anything 
                         yet at all?

                                     TESANDER
                              (thinks it over)
                         Hit some limestone yesterday.

                                     JIM
                         Is that good?

                                     TESANDER
                         That's bad.

               Jim looks at Bill who shakes his head with mock commiseration.

                                     TESANDER
                         And right now it looks like we're 
                         coming into some shale.

                                     JIM
                         That's bad?

                                     TESANDER
                         That's good.

                                     JIM
                         Oh...

               Jim looks at Muriel for comfort which isn't forthcoming.

                                     TESANDER
                         'Course it might turn out to be 
                         sandstone.

                                     JIM
                         That's bad?

               Tesander shakes his head, "No."

                                     JIM
                         That's good?

               Tesander shakes his head, "No."

                                     TESANDER
                         Can't tell. Might be good. Might be 
                         bad. One thing you know -- you got 
                         plenty of shale, sandstone and 
                         limestone.

                                     JIM
                         ...I see.

               He turns a little helplessly to Muriel and Bill.

                                     BILL
                         On a hot day there's nothing like a 
                         nice cool limestone shower.

                                     MURIEL
                              (sweetly)
                         Mr. Tesander, just for the record, 
                         of course, what ever happened to 
                         water?

                                     TESANDER
                         Oh, it's there, all right.
                              (he smiles, nods, 
                              tips his hat to Muriel)
                         Just got to be patient.

               He turns on his motor, goes back to work. Jim, Muriel and 
               Bill start to move off.

                                     BILL
                         If you ask me, this project's getting 
                         a little out of hand.

                                     JIM
                              (defensively)
                         Nothing's getting out of hand at 
                         all. I've made a chart of the whole 
                         operation, and --

                         with a few minor deviations, I know 
                         exactly what every penny's going to 
                         cost.

                              (coolly)
                         And just what does that mean?

                         Meansa we gotta blast.

               There is a loud dynamite blast o.s. As a shower of dirt and 
               rocks cascade down and they run for cover:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               JIM'S COST CHART

               INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - Jim stands casually above the house 
               holding the line with one hand. The group pushing from below 
               now consists of Smith, Hackett, Simms, Retch, Tesander, Zucca 
               and assorted sub-contractors and workmen. As the house moves 
               up a thousand dollars, Jim firmly pushes it back. It now 
               rests at $33,500.

                         You see, Mary, the average fellow 
                         who builds a house doesn't know where 
                         he stands from day to day -- but I 
                         do things a little differently. With 
                         a few minor deviations I know exactly 
                         where every penny is going --

               There is a knock on the door. It opens and Bill Cole appears, 
               briefcase under his arm.

                              (obliquely)
                         While I was in there with Dascomb 
                         the conversation kind of got around 
                         to you and -- uh --

                                     JIM
                              (impatiently)
                         What is it?

                                     BILL
                         Well, he didn't say in so many words 
                         that ever since you started with 
                         that house you haven't turned in a 
                         decent piece of copy, but --

                                     JIM
                         But you kind of got the feeling...

                                     BILL
                         ...that if I told you, you'd know 
                         that he knew that you knew that he 
                         knew... that you knew... or something.

                                     JIM
                         What's he worrying about? The 
                         deadline's three months off. I've 
                         always --

               The phone rings. Mary answers.

                                     MARY
                         Hello? Yes. Just a minute.
                              (hands phone to Jim)
                         Mrs. Blandings calling from Lensdale.

                                     JIM
                         Yes, Muriel. What? What's that? 
                         Tesander struck water! Say that's 
                         wonderful!
                              (to Bill)
                         We've finally got our well.

                                     BILL
                              (drily)
                         Congratulations.

               He extends his hand. Jim absently shakes it, then:

                                     JIM
                              (listens at phone)
                         Huh? What's that?
                              (face falls)
                         What do you mean we've got two wells?
                              (listens; then, grimly)
                         I'll be right out.
                              (hangs up, rises)
                         Come on, Bill, we'd better get out 
                         to Lansdale.

                                     MARY
                         Anything wrong?

                                     JIM
                              (soberly, as he slips 
                              into his coat)
                         Mary, have you ever seriously 
                         considered building a house?

                                     MARY
                         Well, no offense, Mr. Blandings, but 
                         my boy friend says that anybody who 
                         builds a house today is crazy.

                                     JIM
                         You stick with that boy, he's got a 
                         great future.

               As he and Bill start for the door:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE EXCAVATION AT BALD MOUNTAIN - DAY

               Muriel, Jim, Bill, Simms and Retch stand at the edge looking 
               down at the excavation which is partially filled with bubbling 
               water.

                                     JIM
                         You mean you hit a spring, a bubbling 
                         spring right here in our cellar?

                                     SIMMS
                         It'll have to be diverted before 
                         Retch here can lay his cement.

                                     RETCH
                              (dubiously)
                         May take a while. Pumps are over in 
                         Jersey.

               Tesander walks into scene, looks down at the water.

                                     TESANDER
                         Tsk, tsk, tsk.

                                     JIM
                              (mild sarcasm)
                         Water, Mr. Tesander.

                                     TESANDER
                         Yep.

                                     JIM
                         At six feet!

                                     TESANDER
                         Yep.

                                     JIM
                              (indicates)
                         And over there, just thirty-two yards 
                         away, you had to go down two hundred 
                         and twenty-seven feet to hit the 
                         same water.

                                     TESANDER
                         Yep.

                                     JIM
                         How do you account for that, Mr. 
                         Tesander?

               Tesander considers a moment, rubs his chin, then:

                                     TESANDER
                         We-ll, way it seems to me, Mr. 
                         Blandings, over here the water's 
                         down around six feet and over there 
                         it's -- uh --

                                     BILL AND TESANDER
                         -- down around two hundred and twenty-
                         seven feet.

               Jim exchanges a weary look with Muriel.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               SPECIAL EFFECT: MONTAGE

               SPECIAL EFFECT: It consists of a Montage of the following 
               DISSOLVING SHOTS:

               (1) The water being pumped out of the excavation.

               (2) The cement mixer pouring cement into wheelbarrows.

               (3) The pouring of the cement floor, walls and foundations.

               (4) Planks, shingles and plumbing equipment begin to arrive 
               and are strewn about the property.

               (5) The exterior framing of the house begins to go up.

               (6) The sheathing is put on.

               (7) The roof is constructed.

               OVER THIS MONTAGE IS SUPERIMPOSED:

               Jim's Cost Chart. - With each successive operation, a new 
               workman is added to the already considerable group of people 
               who are pushing the house inexorably upward, this against 
               the frantic efforts of a slowly weakening Jim Blandings.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE BLANDINGS' HOUSE - DAY

               The exterior sheathing is completed and, in the roughest of 
               terms, the project begins to resemble a house. Among the 
               workmen's cars we notice the Blandings' convertible.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE INCOMPLETE LIVING ROOM - LOCATION #1 - DAY

               A dozen hammers, saws, trowels, etc. are heard in other parts 
               of the house busily rasping and banging away. Jim and Muriel 
               and Bill appear in the doorway before entering the rough 
               unfinished interior of what will eventually be the living 
               room.

                                     BILL
                         What's this, another closet?

                                     JIM
                         This happens to be our dining room.

                                     MURIEL
                         Not the dining room, dear, the living 
                         room.
                              (indicates)
                         There's the fireplace.

                                     JIM
                         Then where's the dining room?

                                     BILL
                         Maybe it's that little room off the 
                         hallway.

                                     JIM
                         That's the breakfast nook.

                                     MURIEL
                         It's not the breakfast nook, it's 
                         the powder room.

                                     JIM
                         Oh.

                                     BILL
                         Do me a favor -- don't ever invite 
                         me here for a meal.

               Two workmen pass by carrying a few long pieces of lumber. 
               The workmen don't see the Blandings.

                                     FIRST WORKMAN
                         I don't figure this Blandings at 
                         all. If you gotta build on the 
                         windiest hill in Connecticut, why do 
                         you have to pick the windiest side 
                         of the hill?

                                     BILL
                              (to workman)
                         You know these New York millionaires -- 
                         they're eccentric.

               The workmen pass from view.

                                     JIM
                         I think I'd like to go outside.

                                     BILL
                              (gesture to door)
                         After you, Rockefeller.

               As they enter the foyer, a carpenter appears.

                                     CARPENTER
                              (to Jim)
                         Just the man I want to see. Would 
                         you step over here a second?

                                     JIM
                         Sure.

                                     BILL
                              (indicating)
                         I'll browse around upstairs.

               As Bill starts up the stairs, Jim and Muriel follow the 
               carpenter.

                                     CARPENTER
                              (pointing up)
                         On them second floor lintels between 
                         the lally columns, do you want we 
                         should rabbet them or not?

                                     JIM
                              (lost)
                         The -- second -- floor -- lallys?

                                     CARPENTER
                         The second floor lintels, between 
                         the lallys.

                                     JIM
                         Oh. Oh, the lintels between the 
                         lallys?

                                     CARPENTER
                         Yeah. From the blueprints you can't 
                         tell. You want they should be 
                         rabbeted?

               Jim throws a brief look at Muriel who is regarding him 
               skeptically.

                                     JIM
                         Un -- umm. No, I guess not.

                                     CARPENTER
                         Okay, you're the doctor.
                              (calls)
                         Hey, fellas, you got any of them 
                         rabbeted lintels set, rip 'em out!

               After the sheerest pause there comes a shriek of nails 
               brutally withdrawn from timber, a loud splintering of wood 
               and then something of the appearance of entrails comes 
               hurtling down end over end landing with a dusty slap at Jim's 
               feet. The carpenter exits. Muriel gives Jim an accusing look.

                                     JIM
                              (sheepishly)
                         It sounded less... expensive to say 
                         no.

               There is another loud screech and more "entrails" come 
               hurtling down, narrowly missing them. Muriel yells in the 
               direction from which they came.

                                     MURIEL
                         Stop it! Stop it!

               From upstairs comes a long, shrill whistle. Instantly all 
               sound of activity ceases and a voice is heard.

                                     VOICE
                         Okay, fellas, let's quit!

                                     JIM
                              (to Muriel)
                         Now look what you've done.

               As Muriel turns with apprehension, eighteen workmen come 
               trooping down the stairs.

                                     JIM
                              (conciliatory)
                         Look, men, Mrs. Blandings didn't 
                         mean anything.
                              (the workmen regard 
                              him curiously)
                         I mean, there's no point in walking 
                         off a job just because... a woman 
                         makes a silly little remark.

                                     WORKMAN
                         It's Saturday, mister. We quit at 
                         twelve o'clock. This ain't a chain 
                         gang, you know.

               As the workmen exit the Blandings look at each other a little 
               sheepishly, start up the stairs.

               CRANE SHOT - AS THE BLANDINGS GO UP THE STAIRS

               CRANE SHOT - as the Blandings go up the stairs.

                                     MURIEL
                         I'm just sick. From the outside this 
                         house looks like a grain elevator, 
                         and on the inside everything's miles 
                         too small.

               As they reach the second floor landing, we hear, o.s. a steady 
               but muffled pounding.

               They stop as they hear the thumping.

                                     MURIEL
                         What's that?

                                     JIM
                         What's what?

                                     MURIEL
                         That noise -- listen.
                              (again the thumping)
                         It's coming from the closet!

               They rush to the closet, open the heavy oak door. Bill is 
               inside, leaning disgustedly against the wall.

                                     JIM
                         What happened?

                                     BILL
                         The door blew shut. I got locked in.

                                     JIM
                         Impossible. I had this closet built 
                         especially for myself. The lock opens 
                         from the inside.

                                     BILL
                         Maybe for Houdini -- not for me.

               As Bill starts to step out, Jim detains him.

                                     JIM
                         Nothing to it. A child could work 
                         it. Look, I'll show you.

               He steps inside with Bill, firmly closes the door. A moment's 
               pause. The door re-opens.

                                     JIM
                              (condescendingly)
                         You see, it just takes a little good 
                         old Yankee know-how.

                                     MURIEL
                         You know, dear, it's just possible 
                         the lock worked for you and not for 
                         Bill.

                                     JIM
                         Ridiculous. Even you could do it.

                                     MURIEL
                              (sarcastic)
                         Thank you.

                                     JIM
                         Come on, I'll show you.

               He ushers Muriel inside and the door closes on the threesome. 
               The CAMERA REMAINS on the closed door.

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         Go ahead, dear, just open it.

               The knob turns, jiggles a little, but the door remains closed.

                                     MURIEL'S VOICE
                         I don't seem to be able to ---

                                     JIM'S VOICE
                         Here, let me show you! You just take 
                         the knob and turn it clockwise.

               An efficient clockwise turn of the knob. Pause. An impatient 
               doubletwist of the knob. Pause. A more forceful rattling of 
               the knob, plus a slight kick. A furious rattling, pounding 
               and kicking. The door remains closed.

               INT. THE CLOSET

               As Jim turns sheepishly:

                                     BILL
                         Nothing like that good old Yankee 
                         know-how.

               Jim turns back to the door, pounds on it, yelling:

                                     JIM
                         Hey! Hey! Somebody let us out of 
                         here!

               Silence. Muriel is at the shoulder-high circular frame solid 
               glass window. She looks out.

                                     MURIEL
                         Oh, dear.

               Jim and Bill look out.

               INT. CLOSET

                                     BILL
                              (drily)
                         Leave a call for seven o'clock.
                              (afterthought)
                         Monday morning.

               Jim gives him a look, turns back to the window, sizing up an 
               escape, starts muttering to himself.

                                     JIM
                         If I could just get over to that 
                         scaffolding...

               He tests the window frame, finds it solid.

                                     JIM
                              (still muttering)
                         Seems a shame but I guess it's the 
                         only way...

               Jim picks up a piece of tar paper.

                                     MURIEL
                         What are you going to do?

                                     JIM
                         Don't get panicky, I'll get you out 
                         of here.
                              (hands tar paper to 
                              Bill)
                         Here, hold this over the window.

               As Bill somewhat skeptically complies, Jim picks up a piece 
               of two-by-four.

                                     JIM
                         Stand back, Muriel.

               Jim raises the plank, takes a stance.

                                     JIM
                              (to Bill)
                         Ready?

                                     BILL
                         Roger.

               Jim swings; the window shatters. Almost simultaneously there 
               is a click and the door to the closet swings open. As Jim 
               turns with a sense of accomplishment, his face falls as he 
               and the others see that the erratic door has opened.

                                     MURIEL
                              (sweetly)
                         In case of emergency -- break glass. 
                         Come on, Bill.

               As Muriel and Bill precede Jim out of the closet and down 
               the stairs, Jim pauses, speculatively toying with the lock.

                                     JIM
                              (muttering)
                         Funny... always worked before. Huh. 
                         I wonder...

               INT. FOYER - STAIRWAY

               Muriel and Bill walking down the stairs. From upstairs comes 
               a steady sullen pounding from the interior of the closet. 
               Without a word, they stop, look at each other, turn and walk 
               back upstairs.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY

               Muriel and the children are having breakfast. Jim enters, in 
               fairly high spirits, once again improvising to "Home On The 
               Range."

                                     JIM
                              (as he sits down)
                         "Home, home in Connecticut -- Where 
                         you have to conform to local 
                         traditions, customs, politics and 
                         etiquette..."
                              (picks up his morning 
                              mail, starts to thumb 
                              through it)

                                     JOAN
                         Dad, do you suppose I could have a 
                         chemistry lab in the basement?

                                     JIM
                              (preoccupied with 
                              mail)
                         Sure, why not?

                         I think it's awful. Smelling up the 
                         house with those horrible chemicals.

                                     MURIEL
                         Never mind, Betsy.
                              (to Jim)
                         Dear, I'm going up to the place this 
                         afternoon to see about landscaping. 
                         Bill's driving me.

                              (preoccupied)
                         That's nice.
                              (looking up; darkly)
                         What do you mean, Bill's driving 
                         you?

                              (a little annoyed)
                         Why do you always say, "what do you 
                         mean," when you know perfectly well 
                         what I mean and what you mean?

                                     JIM
                         I mean that every time I turn my 
                         back Bill Cole's driving you some 
                         place or something.

                                     MURIEL
                         He's only being helpful.

                                     JIM
                              (annoyed; tears open 
                              a letter)
                         I thought he was a lawyer! Why isn't 
                         he out suing somebody?

                              (to Joan)
                         Another word and you don't get your 
                         laboratory.

                         Well, that's something!

               Jim suddenly explodes, crumpling a letter he has just read.

                                     JIM
                         We'll just see about that!

                              (concerned)
                         What is it, dear?

               Ignoring her, he reaches for the phone, starts to dial.

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim, what's the matter?

                                     JIM
                              (into phone; sharply)
                         Mr. William Cole, please.
                              (pause; then with 
                              rising emotion)
                         Hello, Bill? I want you to fight 
                         this thing! I know my rights as a 
                         citizen! They can't get away with 
                         it!... What do you mean, what am I 
                         talking about? The letter, of course. 
                         From the owner of this building. 
                         They want us to move! It's a thirty 
                         day notice!
                              (listens a moment)
                         But that's ridiculous. How can I 
                         move into a house that isn't even 
                         finished?! No windows, no plaster -- 
                         or paint, or -- or plumbing!
                              (listens a moment; 
                              then with rising 
                              emotion)
                         Now you listen to me! I have no 
                         intention of moving in thirty days! 
                         This is not legal! I'm going to fight 
                         this thing! And I don't care if it 
                         takes every penny I've got!
                              (listens)
                         Yeah... Yeah... Yeah... All right!
                              (hangs up)

                                     MURIEL
                              (expectantly)
                         ...Well?

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         We're moving in thirty days.

               On Muriel's reaction:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. ROAD AND COVERED BRIDGE - DAY

               Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is 
               the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the 
               children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause, 
               over this, we hear:

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         So-came thirty days -- and they moved.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - ENTRANCE TO BRIDGE.

               MED. CLOSE SHOT - Entrance to bridge. As the cavalcade passes 
               through we see in the rear of the trailer, jammed among the 
               household effects, Gussie and a very uncomfortable Mr. Bill 
               Cole.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         I mean -- we moved.

               OTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK

               The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn. 
               Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he 
               impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite 
               direction. Over this:

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                              (as Jim would say it)
                         That's the wrong road! Any fool knows 
                         that!

               Jim starts his car up leading the way.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. ROAD AT THE HOUSE - DAY

               The moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops 
               his car and they all look off at the house, react with 
               pleasant surprise.

               WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING 
               COMPLETION.

               WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - The house is rapidly nearing 
               completion. A half dozen men are finishing the exterior 
               painting, planing down doors, etc. In front, a couple of men 
               from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the 
               first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as 
               a clean, bright and very attractive new house.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Well, there she is, bright and shining -- 
                         and just about complete -- the 
                         residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H. 
                         Blandings.

               INT. THE CAR - DAY

               MOVING SHOT - Jim and Muriel are visibly affected by the 
               sight of their Dream House. They exchange a warm intimate 
               smile.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Not bad at that.

               EXT. THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE - DAY

               MED. SHOT. The car pulls up, stops.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                              (efficient scoutmaster)
                         All right! -- Everybody out.

               Everybody piles out of the car. As Jim and Muriel walk toward 
               the house away from us and Bill, Muriel sentimentally reaches 
               out, takes Jim's hand.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Guess you can't blame them for feeling 
                         just a little bit proud.

               At the door, Jim stops, indicates that he'd like to carry 
               Muriel across the threshold.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                              (sentimentally)
                         Look -- he wants to carry his wife 
                         across the threshold. Romantic, isn't 
                         it?

               JOAN AND BETSY.

               Joan and Betsy. They look on with distinct adolescent 
               disapproval.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Ooops! I guess I meant "corny."

               GROUP SHOT. OVER MURIEL'S PLAYFUL PROTEST

               GROUP SHOT. Over Muriel's playful protest, Jim starts to 
               pick her up.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen 
                         years since you've done this sort of 
                         thing.

               Jim manages to lift Muriel.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's 
                         see if you can make it into the hall.

               Jim carries Muriel over the threshold and into the foyer.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         That's right. Go right in. Don't pay 
                         any attention to the sign.

               The CAMERA PANS TO a LOW SHOT of a sign on the floor of the 
               foyer. It reads:

                                       WET VARNISH

               FULL SHOT - FOYER.

               FULL SHOT - foyer. In the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the 
               floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly 
               varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim 
               stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises, 
               throws down his brush, says something caustic.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                              (imitating painter)
                         Don't mind me, buddy, I just got 
                         through varnishing that floor.

               Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish 
               practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Whose bright idea was this?

               The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly 
               and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of 
               guilt.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         She just wanted everything to be 
                         nice and shiny on the day they moved 
                         in.

               Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Stop painting that floor and put 
                         some planks down in here, or some 
                         thing!

               The painter shouts back.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Okay, mister, but take it easy. The 
                         Republicans ain't in yet, you know.

               Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately 
               trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps. 
               Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.

               EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE - DAY

               As Jim appears, still carrying Muriel, Betsy and Joan catch 
               his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is 
               complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Oh, fine! A house without windows! 
                         We'll just see about that!

               Abruptly handing Muriel to Bill he starts off. Ahead of him 
               and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread 
               out.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         Look out for those papers!

               But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet. 
               After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of 
               them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly 
               disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers 
               flapping behind him.

               EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY

               Jim flaps his way up to a workman who is staring at a pile 
               of window casements.

                                     JIM
                         Where's Simms?

                                     WORKMAN
                         Around back trying to figure out 
                         what to do about them windows.

                                     JIM
                         What's the problem? You put windows 
                         up.

                                     WORKMAN
                         Not these. They don't fit.

                                     JIM
                              (angrily; control 
                              going)
                         Oh, they don't, don't they?

               He continues on toward the back of the house, the newspapers 
               flapping beneath him.

               EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY

               Simms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against 
               the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim 
               Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having 
               picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch 
               hands Jim a sheaf of papers.

                                     RETCH
                         Oh, Mr. Blandings, you'd better look 
                         these over.

                                     JIM
                         What's this about the windows?

                                     SIMMS
                              (calmly)
                         I'm afraid there's a little slip-up. 
                         These windows seem to belong to a 
                         Mr. Landings in Fishkill, New York. 
                         I talked to Mr. Landings this morning.

                                     JIM
                         Well, has he got mine?

                                     SIMMS
                         No, he seems to have some windows 
                         that belong to a Mr. Blandsworth of 
                         Peekskill.

                                     JIM
                         Where are my windows?!

                                     SIMMS
                         As near as we can figure out they've 
                         either been sent to a Mr. Benton in 
                         Evanston, Illinois, or a Mr. Bamberger 
                         of Phoenix, Arizona.

               Bill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder.

                                     JIM
                         What are we supposed to do -- live 
                         the rest of our lives in a house 
                         without windows?

                                     SIMMS
                         It'll just be a matter of a few days.

                                     BILL
                         What's a "Zuz-Zuz Water Soft-N-R"?

                                     JIM
                         How should I know?

                                     BILL
                              (indicating)
                         You've got one.

                                     JIM
                              (reading from bill)
                         "Furnishing and installing one Zuz-
                         Zuz Water Soft-N-R, two hundred and 
                         eighty dollars!"
                              (explosively)
                         I will not have any such piece of 
                         equipment in my house!

                                     SIMMS
                         I'm afraid I authorized that, Mr. 
                         Blandings -- to save your boiler and 
                         water pipes.

                                     JIM
                         From what?!

                                     SIMMS
                         Rust. The plumbing man assures us 
                         the water from your well is the most 
                         corrosive in his entire experience 
                         in the trade.

                              (irritably)
                         Well, if it's necessary, put it in! 
                         We're moving in today, you know and --

                                     RETCH
                         It's in.

                                     JIM
                         Oh.
                              (a final show of 
                              authority; sharply)
                         Then get me the bill for it!

                                     BILL
                              (indicating bill)
                         You've got it.

                                     JIM
                         All right then.

               And he stalks off, his papers, shavings, etc. flapping behind 
               him.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

               The moving vans are driving away.

               INT. THE FOYER - LATE AFTERNOON

               A general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen 
               carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel, 
               list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to 
               Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss 
               painter. In the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is 
               PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant.

                                     MURIEL
                         Now I want the living room to be a 
                         soft green.
                              (PeDelford nods)
                         Not quite as bluish as a robin's 
                         egg, but yet not as yellow as daffodil 
                         buds.

                                     PEDELFORD
                         Mm.

                                     MURIEL
                              (handing him a sample)
                         The best sample I could get is a 
                         little too yellow, but don't let 
                         whoever mixes it go to the other 
                         extreme and get it too blue. It should 
                         just be sort of a grayish yellow 
                         green.

                                     PEDELFORD
                              (making a note)
                         Mm-hmm.

               They turn to the dining room.

                                     MURIEL
                         Now the dining room I'd like yellow. 
                         Not just yellow, a very gay yellow.

                                     PEDELFORD
                         Mm-hmm.

                                     MURIEL
                         Something bright and sunshiny.
                              (sudden inspiration)
                         I tell you, Mr. PeDelford, if you'll 
                         just send one of your workmen to the 
                         A&P for a pound of their best butter 
                         and match it exactly, you can't go 
                         wrong.

                                     PEDELFORD
                              (making a note)
                         Mm.

                                     MURIEL
                         This is the paper we're going to use 
                         here in the foyer.
                              (hands sample to him)
                         It's flowered but I don't want the 
                         ceiling to match any of the colors 
                         of the flowers. There are some little 
                         dots in the background, and it's 
                         these dots I want you to match. Not 
                         the little greenish dots near the 
                         hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish 
                         dot between the rosebud and the 
                         delphinium blossom. Is that clear?

               PeDelford looks carefully at the sample, then:

                                     PEDELFORD
                              (making note)
                         Mm-hmm.

                                     MURIEL
                         The kitchen's to be white. Not a 
                         cold, antiseptic hospital white -- a 
                         little warmer but not to suggest any 
                         other color but white.

                                     PEDELFORD
                              (note)
                         Mm.

                                     MURIEL
                         Now for the powder room, I want you 
                         to match this thread.
                              (hands him thread)
                         You can see it's practically an apple 
                         red. Somewhere between a healthy 
                         Winesap and an unripened Jonathan.

                                     PEDELFORD
                              (making note)
                         Mm.

               There is a crash from the kitchen.

                                     MURIEL
                         Will you excuse me?

               Muriel hastily exits toward the kitchen. PeDelford turns to 
               his assistant.

                                     PEDELFORD
                         Got it, Charlie?

                                     CHARLIE
                              (deadpan; indicating 
                              rooms with his thumb)
                         Green, yellow, blue, white, red.

                                     PEDELFORD
                         Check.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. PANTRY - OFF KITCHEN - DAY

               Joan is on a stepladder helping Gussie put away some dishes. 
               Remains of two broken plates are on the floor below them.

                                     MURIEL
                         Joan, you know father was to take 
                         care of the heavy dishes.

                                     JOAN
                         He disappeared. I haven't seen him 
                         for an hour.

               Betsy flies into the room waving a railroad timetable.

                                     BETSY
                         Where's Uncle Bill? I just checked 
                         the timetable -- he's going to miss 
                         his train.

                                     MURIEL
                         If they've run off somewhere it 
                         certainly isn't very --
                              (suddenly stops, 
                              listens)

               From upstairs comes the SOUND of a steady, methodical thumping 
               of a hand on a solid oak door.

                                     MURIEL
                         Heavens!

               She rushes for the door.

               UPSTAIRS LANDING

               Muriel opens the closet door revealing Jim and Bill, who 
               have been locked in the closet for the last hour. Each leans 
               against the wall, arms folded, in an attitude of boredom and 
               disgust. Without a word Jim and Bill exit from the closet. 
               The three start down the stairs.

                                     JIM
                              (darkly)
                         I thought you were going to take 
                         care of it.

                                     MURIEL
                         I thought you were.

                              (from below)
                         You're going to miss your train, 
                         Uncle Bill! It leaves Lansdale in 
                         twenty-five minutes.

                                     BILL
                         Isn't there a later one?

                                     BETSY
                         Not till the Commuter's Special 
                         tomorrow morning at six-fifteen.

                                     JIM
                         You mean seven-fifteen.

                                     BETSY
                         No, Dad, six-fifteen.

                                     JIM
                         What about the seven-fifteen I'm 
                         supposed to take to the office every 
                         morning?!

                                     BETSY
                              (consulting timetable)
                         There's a little asterisk. The seven-
                         fifteen only runs Saturdays, Sundays 
                         and holidays.

                                     JIM
                              (taking timetable)
                         Let me see that!
                              (scans table, 
                              tightlipped)
                         Muriel!

                                     MURIEL
                         Oh, dear, don't tell me I read it 
                         wrong.

                                     JIM
                         That's fine! For the rest of my life 
                         I'm going to have to get up at five 
                         o'clock in the morning to catch the 
                         six-fifteen, to get to my office by 
                         eight, which doesn't even open until 
                         nine -- and which I never get to 
                         until ten!

                                     MURIEL
                         Perhaps if you started earlier you 
                         could quit earlier.

                                     JIM
                              (sharply)
                         So I could get home earlier to go to 
                         bed earlier to get up earlier!

                                     BILL
                         Maybe you can have the railroad push 
                         the train up to four-fifteen -- then 
                         you won't have to go to bed at all!

                                     BETSY
                         Uncle Bill, you're going to miss 
                         your train!

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim, you clean up this mess. I'll 
                         drive Bill to the station and pick 
                         up some cold cuts for dinner.

               Betsy and Joan pick up some boxes and walk into the dining 
               room.

                                     BETSY
                         You'd better hurry!

                                     BILL
                              (indicating upstairs 
                              closet)
                         Kind of hate to leave that little 
                         place. Just four walls and a couple 
                         of mothballs, but to me it'll always 
                         be home.

                              timetable)
                         So long, Bill.

               Bill and Muriel exit.

               As Jim drifts in, still preoccupied with timetable:

                         It's certainly going to be fun this 
                         summer when Uncle Bill comes up for 
                         his vacation.

                                     BETSY
                         We'll get in a lot of doubles.

                         Hmm?
                              (looks up from 
                              timetable)
                         What are you talking about? Bill's 
                         going to Europe.

                                     BETSY
                         No, he's not. I heard him and mother 
                         talking. He's going to move his 
                         vacation up and take a place in 
                         Lansdale.

                                     JIM
                              (vaguely annoyed)
                         Uh-huh... Mm-hm. Mm-hm... Uh-huh.
                              (then, covering up)
                         All right, come on, come on. Get 
                         busy.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' CAR - (PROCESS)

               Evening is beginning to fall as Muriel drives Bill into town.

                                     MURIEL
                         I'll scout around and find you a 
                         place in Lansdale.
                              (quickly)
                         Now, you're not going to change your 
                         mind about coming up?

                                     BILL
                         Don't worry, I'll be on the job.

                                     MURIEL
                         It won't be easy. I promise you a 
                         Cook's tour of every lamp maker, rug 
                         weaver, and antique shop in Lansdale 
                         County.

                                     BILL
                              (philosophically)
                         When I married you two I suppose I 
                         took you for better or for worse.

               Muriel smiles warmly, and in a friendly gesture reaches over 
               and pats his hand.

                                     MURIEL
                         Good old Uncle Bill.

                                     BILL
                              (drily)
                         Good old Uncle Bill.

               As they exchange an understanding smile:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               It is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children 
               are unpacking a last barrel. They have made a rather unsteady 
               pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects. 
               Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in 
               the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the 
               room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into 
               the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which 
               contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime 
               accumulation of sentimental trinkets.

                                     JIM
                         Now look what you've done!

               Betsy coughs her way to the fireplace, turns the flue handle. 
               The smoke immediately goes up the chimney and the room starts 
               to clear.

                                     BETSY
                         Father, the first principle of 
                         lighting a fire is to see if the 
                         flue is open. A three-year-old child 
                         knows that.

                                     JIM
                         Next time we want a fire I'll send 
                         out for a three-year-old child!
                              (indicates trinkets)
                         Get that stuff cleaned up and go in 
                         and help Gussie set the table. It's 
                         getting late.

               The children start gathering up the debris. Joan picks up 
               some trinkets which have spilled from a cardboard box.

                                     JOAN
                         Look, Dad, your fraternity pins.

                                     JIM
                              (busy cleaning the 
                              fireplace)
                         Pins? I only had one.

                                     JOAN
                         There are two of them here.

                                     JIM
                         All right, all right. Just put them 
                         away.

                                     JOAN
                              (examining them)
                         Funny, this one says W.C. on the 
                         back. W.C.?
                              (brightly)
                         William Cole! It must be Uncle Bill's!

                                     JIM
                         Huh?
                              (reaching for it)
                         Let me see that.
                              (examining pin)
                         Hmmmm.

               Betsy has picked up a small leather-bound book. She whistles.

                                     JOAN
                         What's that?

                                     BETSY
                         Mother's diary when she was in 
                         college. It's slightly torrid.

                                     JOAN
                              (coming over)
                         Let's see.

                                     JIM
                              (sharply)
                         That's none of your business!

                                     BETSY
                              (scanning page)
                         I'd say mother and Uncle Bill were 
                         somewhat of an item!

                                     JIM
                              (taking book from 
                              Betsy)
                         People do not read other people's 
                         diaries! It's not a very nice thing 
                         to do!
                              (shooting them out)
                         Now go in there and help Gussie with 
                         the table.

                                     BETSY
                              (indicating debris)
                         What about --?

                                     JIM
                         I'll take care of that. Now, shoo, 
                         shoo.

               The children exit. Jim is about to put down the diary when 
               his curiosity gets the better of him. Making sure he's 
               unobserved, he sits down on a box, opens the book, starts to 
               read. As his brows wrinkle with concern:

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT

               The wind is howling, the trees swaying. The lights are on in 
               the kitchen. CAMERA MOVES UP to the open kitchen window.

               INT. THE KITCHEN - NIGHT

               The family, in overcoats, is huddled around the kitchen table 
               finishing dinner. Gussie, in overcoat and muffler, is clearing 
               the dishes away. Jim, a sober look on his face, rises, takes 
               a steaming kettle from the stove.

                                     MURIEL
                         Where are you going?

                                     JIM
                         To shave.

                                     MURIEL
                         Tonight??

                                     JIM
                         While I can still trust myself with 
                         a razor. At six o'clock in the morning 
                         I'd probably cut my throat. Goodnight.

               Jim abruptly exits. Muriel looks after him with concern.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Jim, in his pajamas and overcoat is shaving. After a few 
               moments Muriel, in her nightgown and overcoat, enters the 
               scene.

                                     MURIEL
                         Excuse...

               She takes her toothbrush and opens the cabinet, Jim 
               automatically moving around back of it in their previously 
               established pattern. As Muriel puts the paste on her brush, 
               replaces the tube, shuts the cabinet and starts to brush her 
               teeth, Jim uncomfortably moves back to his original position.

                                     MURIEL
                         Excuse...

                                     JIM
                         Muriel, do you have to do that now?!

                                     MURIEL
                         There's no need to be so irritable 
                         just because you have to shave at 
                         night.

                                     JIM
                         I'm not irritable!

                                     MURIEL
                         Well, you're certainly something! 
                         You haven't said a civil word all 
                         evening.

                                     JIM
                         Sometimes a man doesn't feel like 
                         talking.

                                     MURIEL
                              (solicitously)
                         What is it, dear? Something down at 
                         the office?

                                     JIM
                         No.

                                     MURIEL
                         Have you got the new slogan for 
                         "Wham"?

                                     JIM
                         It's not due yet!

                                     MURIEL
                         Well, it's something. You're certainly 
                         upset about something. I can always 
                         tell.

                                     JIM
                         I'm not upset.
                              (going back to shaving; 
                              with studied unconcern)
                         It's just that I don't happen to 
                         approve of falsehood and deception. 
                         Particularly in my own wife.

                                     MURIEL
                         What are you talking about?

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         Oh, nothing. It's just that I 
                         distinctly remember your telling me 
                         you gave back Bill's fraternity pin 
                         fifteen years ago.

               Muriel looks at him, puzzled.

                                     JIM
                         Well, did you or didn't you?

                                     MURIEL
                         Did I, or didn't I what?

                                     JIM
                         Give it back to him.

                                     MURIEL
                         Of course I did. If I said I did, I 
                         did.

                                     JIM
                              (suddenly Sam Spade)
                         Then perhaps you'd have the goodness 
                         to explain how this happened to fall 
                         out of your jewel box?

               He takes the pin out of his pocket and hands it to her. Muriel 
               takes the pin, looks at it sentimentally. Suddenly she looks 
               at Jim and bursts out laughing.

                                     JIM
                         What's so funny?

                                     MURIEL
                         You! You're jealous! You're standing 
                         there with your face full of soap 
                         and you're jealous.

                              (angrily)
                         If you were so crazy about the guy, 
                         why didn't you marry him?!

                                     MURIEL
                              (beginning to be a 
                              little angry)
                         Because I wasn't in love with him!

                                     JIM
                              (vindictively)
                         That's not what you said in your 
                         diary!

                                     MURIEL
                              (now really angry)
                         Oh, now you've been reading my diary!

                                     JIM
                              (a little guilty)
                         Well -- it happened to fall open 
                         and... I... happened to look at it. 
                         It... just happened.

                                     MURIEL
                         I'll just bet!

                                     JIM
                         It's all over the book so why don't 
                         you admit it? You were in love with 
                         Bill Cole!

                                     MURIEL
                         Don't be absurd! Of course I was in 
                         love with Bill. In those days I was 
                         in love with a new man every week.

                                     JIM
                         Then why did you marry me?

                                     MURIEL
                         I'm beginning to wonder!
                              (exploding)
                         Maybe it was those big cow eyes of 
                         yours or that ridiculous hole in 
                         your chin! Maybe I knew that some 
                         day you'd bring me out to this thirty-
                         eight thousand dollar icebox with a 
                         dried-up trout stream and no windows! 
                         Or maybe I just happened to fall in 
                         love with you -- but for heaven's 
                         sake, don't ask me why!

               Muriel stalks out of the bathroom. Jim looks after her, 
               thoughtfully starts to dry his face.

               INT. THE BEDROOM

               Jim enters. Muriel stands with her back to him angrily winding 
               the clock. Jim noisily clears his throat. No reaction.

                                     JIM
                              (tentatively)
                         ...Muriel?

               No reaction.

                                     JIM
                         ...Honey?

               No reaction.

                                     JIM
                         Would it do any good to say I'm sorry?

                                     MURIEL
                         I don't know.

               Jim gently turns her around facing him.

                                     JIM
                         Well -- I am. I acted like a schoolboy 
                         and I'm sorry.

               Muriel looks at Jim. Finally she smiles.

                                     MURIEL
                         Oh, Jim!

               She goes into his arms and they kiss intimately. As their 
               lips part:

                                     MURIEL
                              (dreamily)
                         Why don't you take the soap out of 
                         your ears?

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         Why do I love you so much?

               Jim again kisses her tenderly, warmly.

                                     MURIEL
                              (breathless)
                         Darling, it's awfully late.

               Jim kisses her again, a little more ardently.

                                     MURIEL
                              (same)
                         Maybe you ought to go down and lock 
                         the doors.

                                     JIM
                              (kissing her ear)
                         What for? The windows are all open 
                         anyway.

                                     MURIEL
                              (as he starts to kiss 
                              her again)
                         Jim, you have to get up at six 
                         o'clock.

                                     JIM
                              (considers; logic 
                              prevails; brief sigh)
                         Yes, I guess so.

                                     MURIEL
                              (reluctantly)
                         Goodnight, dear.

                                     JIM
                              (same)
                         Goodnight.

               Each gets into his own bed, still wearing the overcoats.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INSERT JIM'S COST CHART - The house now wavers at $37,000. 
               As Jim and Muriel still try to stem the tide, the group that 
               is pushing the house ever upward includes all of the previous 
               people connected with the house and -- in addition --plumbers, 
               painters, landscape gardeners, etc. Over this, and across 
               the scene flutter more bills, more extras.

                                     BILL'S VOICE
                         And so the days sped by -- and the 
                         bills -- and the extras -- and as 
                         the house approached forty thousand 
                         dollars, Jim approached his deadline 
                         for the new slogan. It was almost a 
                         photo finish.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. RADIO CITY - NIGHT (STOCK)

               It is raining. The lights are on in the buildings.

               INT. JIM'S OFFICE - NIGHT

               Mary is attending to some detail work as the door opens and 
               Jim enters, disturbed. Mary looks at him questioningly.

                                     JIM
                         You'd better send out for coffee and 
                         sandwiches,... It looks like an all 
                         night session.

                                     MARY
                              (concerned)
                         What did he say?

                                     JIM
                              (wearily, seating 
                              himself at desk)
                         Tomorrow morning.

                                     MARY
                              (sighs)
                         Well, I guess you'll just have to 
                         dream something up -- good or bad.

                                     JIM
                         I rather got the impression it had 
                         better be good.

                                     MARY
                              (raised eyebrow)
                         Oh.

               He picks up a pencil, nibbles on it thoughtfully. The silence 
               in the room is broken only by the patter of raindrops on the 
               window. It strikes a note in Jim's subconscious. He swivels 
               around in his chair and stares soberly out the window.

                                     JIM
                              (ruminatively, almost 
                              to himself)
                         Funny how you look forward to the 
                         little things. Rain, for instance.

               Mary looks at him curiously. He turns to her.

                                     JIM
                         For a month now, I guess I've been 
                         looking forward to the first rainy 
                         night at the house.
                              (looks at Muriel's 
                              picture)
                         Big blazing fire. Muriel knitting. 
                         Me in my new smoking jacket... with 
                         my pipe and slippers, reading my 
                         paper...
                              (sighs)
                         Oh, well.

               As he starts to work.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Note: The house is painted and almost completely furnished.

               A hard rain beats on the windows. There is a blazing fire in 
               the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, 
               comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one 
               Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, 
               pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. 
               Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes 
               are hanging up to dry. The cozy tranquillity is broken by a 
               sharp RINGING of the front doorbell.

                                     MURIEL
                              (with relief)
                         Thank heavens! The children.

                                     BILL
                              (rising)
                         Stay put. You look too comfortable.

               The CAMERA FOLLOWS Bill to the front door. He opens it. A 
               man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving 
               rain. The man enters as Bill struggles to get the door shut 
               against the wind.

                                     MR. JONES
                         Whew! What a night! I'm Jones, from 
                         down the road. Just came over to 
                         tell you your kids are all right, 
                         Mr. Blandings.

                                     BILL
                         Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings. Cole's 
                         the name, Bill Cole.

               He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an 
               explanation is necessary.

                                     BILL
                         Friend of the family. Wet clothes. 
                         Just came in out of the rain.

               Muriel walks into scene. Jones takes in the bathrobe, again 
               looks skeptically at Bill.

                                     MURIEL
                         I'm Mrs. Blandings.

                                     JONES
                         How do. Mrs. Williams just called. 
                         Says your phone's out of order. Wanted 
                         me to tell you the water's rising 
                         and they've got the bridge roped 
                         off. Girls'll spend the night over 
                         at her place.

                                     MURIEL
                         Thank you. I was beginning to get 
                         concerned. Can I make you a cup of 
                         tea?

                                     JONES
                         No, thanks. Better be gettin' back 
                         'fore I have to swim for it. 'Night, 
                         Mrs. Blandings.
                              (to Bill)
                         'Night, Mr. Bl--

                                     BILL
                              (weak smile)
                         Cole. Bill Cole. Friend of the family. 
                         Just came in out of the rain.

                                     JONES
                              (uncertainly)
                         Well -- 'Night.

                                     MURIEL
                         Goodnight... and thanks so much.

               The door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain. 
               Jones exits as Muriel and Bill push the door against the 
               wind, finally getting it shut.

                                     BILL
                         That's fine. No bridge. How do I get 
                         back to Lansdale?

                                     MURIEL
                              (simply)
                         You'll just have to spend the night 
                         right here.

               As they start back into the living room:

                                     BILL
                         Muriel, really! With your husband in 
                         New York and your children away -- 
                         think of my reputation.

                                     MURIEL
                              (smile)
                         Don't worry, Snow White, you'll be 
                         as pure and unsullied in the morning 
                         as you were the night before.

                                     BILL
                              (with resignation)
                         That's the story of my life.

               Muriel pokes the dying fire, looks up thoughtfully.

                                     MURIEL
                         Poor Jim, he sounded so worried 
                         before. I certainly hope he comes up 
                         with something.

                                     BILL
                         Don't worry about the man who gave 
                         the world "When you've got the whim, 
                         say Wham!"-- This well will never 
                         run dry.

                                                              SLOW DISSOLVE

               INT. JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING

               The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger 
               impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses 
               that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, 
               disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt 
               from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty 
               he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently 
               stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the 
               window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods 
               the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully 
               out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his 
               fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting 
               on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.

                                     JIM
                              (selling; a note of 
                              desperation in his 
                              voice)
                         "Compare the price, compare the slice, 
                         Take our advice -- Buy Wham!"

               Mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. Jim 
               wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with 
               his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, 
               throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he 
               reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.

                                     JIM
                         "If you'd buy better ham. You'd better 
                         buy Wham!"

                                     MARY
                         It's Boyle Petroleum. "If you'd buy 
                         better oil, You'd better buy Boyle."

               Her eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping 
               over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece 
               of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it, 
               kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. 
               Mary looks up.

                                     JIM
                         "This little pig went to market As 
                         meek and as mild as a lamb. He smiled 
                         in his tracks When they slipped him 
                         the axe He knew he'd turn out to be 
                         Wham!"

               A long silent look passes between them.

                                     JIM
                              (quietly)
                         "...knew he'd turn out to be Wham!"

               He suddenly and angrily gathers all his papers, slams them 
               into the wastebasket.

                                     JIM
                              (rising panic)
                         It's gone! I've lost my touch! Maybe 
                         I never had a touch! Maybe "Whim Say 
                         Wham" was an accident! Who knows? I 
                         can't think any more! All I've got 
                         on my mind is a house with an eighteen 
                         thousand dollar mortgage, and bills, 
                         and extras, and antiques, and -- and --
                              (dejected)
                         I don't know... I don't know.

               Mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what 
               to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally 
               distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his 
               desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it 
               with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with 
               determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.

                                     MARY
                              (startled)
                         Where are you going?

                                     JIM
                         Home, to get some sleep -- and I'd 
                         advise you to do the same.

                                     MARY
                         But -- but you haven't --

                                     JIM
                         Suppose I haven't! This isn't the 
                         only job in town!

                                     MARY
                         But -- but -- what'll I tell Mr. 
                         Dascomb?

                                     JIM
                              (sharply)
                         You just tell him to -- to --
                              (with finality)
                         You just tell him!

               He exits.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               EXT. THE BLANDINGS' HOME - DAY

               It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural-
               looking taxi deposits a weary Jim, who pays the driver. As 
               the cab drives off, Jim looks speculatively at Simms' car, 
               which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and 
               enters. Under this a slightly sour underscoring of "Home On 
               The Range."

               INT. BLANDINGS LIVING ROOM - DAY

               As Jim comes into the foyer, he sees Muriel, in nightgown 
               and robe, talking to Mr. Simms. She holds the rolled-up volume 
               of blueprints that went into building the house.

                                     JIM
                         'Morning, dear.

                                     MURIEL
                              (going to him; 
                              solicitously)
                         Darling, you must be exhausted. How 
                         did it go?

                                     JIM
                         Fine. Fine.

               They kiss.

                                     MURIEL
                              (obliquely)
                         Is... everything all right?

                                     JIM
                              (unenthusiastic)
                         Everything's fine.
                              (still in embrace; 
                              looking up)
                         Hello, Simms, what brings you out 
                         with the morning dew?

                                     SIMMS
                         Just dropped by to check the 
                         blueprints. Some extras came in from 
                         Retch this morning and there're a 
                         couple of things I thought we ought 
                         to go over together.

                                     JIM
                              (arms still around 
                              Muriel; unconcerned)
                         Really. What are they?

                                     SIMMS
                         Well, let's see.
                              (thumbing through 
                              sheets)
                         Few little things here, all right, I 
                         guess. "Mortising five butts -- a 
                         dollar sixty-eight."

                                     JIM
                         Let's not quibble about that. A man's 
                         entitled to mortise a few butts now 
                         and then.

                                     SIMMS
                              (next sheet)
                         Extra nails and screws -- three 
                         dollars, eighty-nine cents.

                                     JIM
                         Petty larceny, but let him get away 
                         with it.

                                     SIMMS
                         Now there's one here I frankly don't 
                         understand. Ah, here we are.
                              (reads)
                         "Changes in closet, twelve hundred 
                         and forty-seven dollars." Did you 
                         authorize that?

                                     JIM
                         Well, we probably told him to --
                              (reacting)
                         Twelve hundred and what?!

                                     SIMMS
                         Forty-seven dollars. Changes in 
                         closet.
                              (hands bill to Jim)

                                     JIM
                              (explosively)
                         Who does he think we are!
                              (looks at bill; very 
                              businesslike)
                         What's this notation: "Refer to Detail 
                         Sheet Number one thirty-five?"

                                     SIMMS
                              (indicating blueprints)
                         Far as I remember, that would be 
                         something in the back of the house. 
                         Let's just take a look.

               As he unrolls the blueprints, Jim looks suspiciously at 
               Muriel. She seems a little nervous.

                                     SIMMS
                         Ah, here we are. It isn't a closet 
                         at all. It's off the back pantry... 
                         Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.

                                     JIM
                         Oh... Mrs. Blandings' little flower 
                         sink.

                                     SIMMS
                              (to Muriel)
                         You didn't authorize any changes, 
                         did you?

                                     MURIEL
                              (defensively)
                         Well... they certainly weren't 
                         changes.

                                     JIM
                         What -- have -- you -- done?

                                     MURIEL
                              (speaking rapidly a 
                              little confused)
                         I haven't done anything! And what I 
                         did was... just nothing at all.

                                     JIM
                         What -- have -- you -- done?!

                                     MURIEL
                         Well --
                              (rattling off)
                         All I did was one day I saw four 
                         pieces of flagstone left over from 
                         the porch that were just going to be 
                         thrown away because nobody wanted 
                         them and I asked Mr. Retch if he 
                         wouldn't just put them down on the 
                         floor of the flower sink and poke a 
                         little cement between the cracks and 
                         give me a nice stone floor where it 
                         might be wet with flowers and things. 
                         That was absolutely all I did.

               During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his 
               head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't 
               lost on Jim.

                                     JIM
                         That's all you did?

                                     MURIEL
                         Absolutely. Just four little pieces 
                         of flagstone.

                                     SIMMS
                              (to Muriel; wearily)
                         Did you by any chance authorize a 
                         drain?

                                     MURIEL
                              (verge of tears)
                         Of course I didn't. All I said was I 
                         wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. 
                         Retch was just as nice as could be 
                         and said, "You're the doctor," and 
                         that's all anybody ever said to 
                         anybody about anything.

               Jim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms.

                                     JIM
                         ...Well?

                                     SIMMS
                              (sigh; plunging in)
                         All right, I think I can tell you 
                         what happened. First, the carpenters 
                         had to rip up the flooring that was 
                         already laid. Those planks run under 
                         the whole width of the pantry, so 
                         Retch had to knock the bottom out of 
                         the pantry wall to get at them.

               JIM AND MURIEL

               Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were 
               premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over 
               this:

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                         Then he had to chop out the tops of 
                         the joists under the flower sink 
                         space to make room for a cradle. I 
                         guess he bought some iron straps and 
                         fastened them to a big pan to give 
                         him something to hold the cement. 
                         What with that added load on the 
                         weakened joists, I'll bet he had to 
                         put a lally column down there for 
                         support, too.

                                     MURIEL
                         It was just four little pieces of 
                         flagstone, and I only ---

                                     JIM
                         Quiet!

               GROUP SHOT - DURING THE FOLLOWING SPEECH

               GROUP SHOT - During the following speech we see Bill Cole, 
               in Jim's pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the 
               room. Jim and Muriel are not aware of his presence.

                                     SIMMS
                         Well, the main soil pipe runs under 
                         there on wall brackets, so Retch had 
                         to get his plumbing man back to take 
                         out a section so he could get that 
                         cradle set. I guess that meant he 
                         had to change the pitch of the soil 
                         pipe from one end of the house to 
                         the other.
                              (looks up)
                         'Morning, Mr. Cole.

                                     BILL
                         'Morning. Hello, Jim.

                                     JIM
                              (turning)
                         Hello, Bill.

               Jim turns away, reacts, suddenly turns back to Bill, taking 
               in the pajamas and robe. A little shocked but unwilling to 
               believe the implication of what he sees, he looks to Muriel 
               for an explanation.

                                     MURIEL
                              (lamely)
                         The bridge was roped off and Bill 
                         had to stay last night.

                                     JIM
                         ...Oh.

                                     BILL
                              (cheerily)
                         Slept like a rock.

                                     JIM
                         I'm delighted.

               Jim looks at Bill, then back at Muriel.

                                     SIMMS
                              (clearing his throat)
                         And then, of course, there are hot 
                         and cold water pipes hooked to the 
                         joists right under that pantry. They 
                         go up to the wing bathroom on the 
                         second floor, and I'll bet my bottom 
                         dollar he had to relocate them.

               THREE SHOT - JIM, MURIEL AND BILL.

               THREE SHOT - Jim, Muriel and Bill. Jim turns to listen but 
               finds himself looking speculatively at Muriel and Bill.

                                     SIMMS' VOICE
                         And I guess the electrician had to 
                         rip out about sixty feet of armored 
                         cable between the main panel and the 
                         junction box by the oil burner, 
                         including the two hundred twenty 
                         volt cable that goes to the stove.

               FULL SHOT - GUSSIE APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY

               FULL SHOT - Gussie appears in the doorway in raincoat, 
               carrying umbrella.

                                     GUSSIE
                         'Morning, everybody. Whew! What a 
                         night!

                                     JIM
                         Where have you been?

                                     GUSSIE
                         Lansdale. Couldn't get back across 
                         the bridge.

                                     JIM
                         You... weren't here last night?

                                     GUSSIE
                         They weren't letting anybody across 
                         that bridge, Mr. Blandings.
                              (to Muriel)
                         I passed the girls over at the 
                         Williams. They'll be along any minute.

               As Jim reacts:

                                     MURIEL
                              (quickly)
                         Thank you, Gussie. You'd better get 
                         breakfast started.

               As Gussie exits, Muriel turns to Simms.

                                     MURIEL
                         Where were we?

                                     BILL
                         We were at the two hundred twenty 
                         volt cable that goes to the stove.

                                     JIM
                         Just a minute.
                              (looks at Bill, then 
                              at Muriel)
                         You mean the children weren't here 
                         last night either?

                                     MURIEL
                         How could they be, dear? The bridge 
                         was closed.

                                     JIM
                         I just came across it.

                                     MURIEL
                         Well, it was closed last night.

                                     JIM
                              (pointedly)
                         It's open now!

               Embarrassed pause.

                                     BILL
                              (attempt at breeziness)
                         If you'll all excuse me -- I -- I 
                         think I'll just go up and slip into 
                         something a little more comfortable.

               Bill exits. Another pause. Simms, aware of the tension, wants 
               to get out of there.

                                     SIMMS
                              (rapidly)
                         Well, that's about the size of it --

               Through Simms' speech, Jim looks darkly at Muriel.

                                     SIMMS
                         -- except that Retch had to repair 
                         the pantry wall and that meant getting 
                         a plasterer back. And of course, he 
                         couldn't have broken through that 
                         wall --

                                     JIM
                         All right, Simms, all right. We'll 
                         take care of it.

                                     SIMMS
                              (preparing to exit)
                         I'll admit it's a little steep. But 
                         I'll try to get Retch to knock a 
                         hundred dollars off the bill. If I 
                         can't get that, I'll certainly try 
                         for seventy-five.

                                     JIM
                         Fine.

                                     SIMMS
                         If he doesn't go for seventy-five, 
                         I'll take a stab at fifty.

                                     JIM
                         You do that.

                                     SIMMS
                              (at the door)
                         Anyway, I'm almost sure we can get 
                         twenty-five.

               There is no answer.

                                     SIMMS
                              (lamely)
                         Well. Good day.

               He leaves. There is a deadly pause.

                                     MURIEL
                              (carefully)
                         Now dear, you're upset, you've got a 
                         lot of things on your mind --

                                     JIM
                              (with dangerous calm)
                         Muriel, there's only one thing on my 
                         mind -- This house -- and how fast 
                         we can get rid of it!

                                     MURIEL
                         That's not what you're thinking.

                                     JIM
                         Maybe it's not. Maybe I'm thinking I 
                         was once a happy man!
                              (the martyr)
                         I didn't have a closet, I didn't 
                         have three bathrooms, but I did have 
                         my sanity, a few dollars in the bank, 
                         two children who loved me and a wife 
                         I could trust!

                                     MURIEL
                         That's a fine thing to say!

                                     JIM
                         I also had a job at Danton and 
                         Bascomb, something I don't happen to 
                         have at the moment!

                                     MURIEL
                         Jim!

                                     JIM
                         That's right, I've resigned! We're 
                         starting all over again! From scratch! 
                         And without this house!

                                     MURIEL
                              (near tears)
                         You love this house!

                                     JIM
                         I hate it!

               In the b.g. Mr. Tesander enters, cap in hand, stands there, 
               nervous and embarrassed.

                                     MURIEL
                         You don't mean that.

                                     JIM
                         Every word of it! Anybody who builds 
                         a house today is crazy! The minute 
                         you start, they put you on the list. 
                         The All-American Sucker list! 
                         Everywhere you turn they've got a 
                         hand in your pocket. If you take out 
                         their hands, they find more pockets!
                              (explosively)
                         It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a 
                         conspiracy against every man and 
                         woman who want a home of their own! 
                         Against every boy and girl who were 
                         ever in love!

               Tesander clears his throat. Jim turns.

                                     JIM
                              (sharply)
                         What do you want?!

               A slight embarrassed pause. Then:

                                     TESANDER
                              (shyly)
                         Well, Mr. Blandings, there's a matter 
                         of twelve dollars and eighty-six 
                         cents.

                                     JIM
                              (with a wild gleam)
                         Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents! 
                         Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander?
                              (emptying pockets)
                         Take everything I've got! Spread it 
                         out among your pals!
                              (advancing toward the 
                              bewildered Tesander)
                         Wouldn't Retch like a little 
                         something? Maybe Zucca could use my 
                         new dinner jacket? It's open house, 
                         Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this 
                         isn't enough I'll come over to your 
                         place and do some odd chores. Maybe 
                         I can mow your lawn or scratch your 
                         back!

                                     TESANDER
                              (simply)
                         You don't understand, Mr. Blandings. 
                         This twelve dollars and eighty-six 
                         cents -- you don't owe me, I owe 
                         you.

               There is a momentary pause.

                                     JIM
                         ...W-what was that?

                                     TESANDER
                              (taking out money)
                         Found I overcharged you. Almost three 
                         feet.

               He hands the money to Jim, who stares at it blankly.

                                     TESANDER
                         Better count it. I think it's all 
                         there.

               Jim looks haplessly at Muriel, sheepish, guilty.

                                     MURIEL
                         Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.

                                     TESANDER
                         Well, I guess I'd better be gettin' 
                         along.
                              (looking around)
                         Sure got a pretty place here.
                              (at door; pauses; 
                              looks back)
                         I'll tell Mr. Zucca about the dinner 
                         jacket.

               Jim and Muriel look at each other a little sheepishly.

               INT. THE FOYER

               As Tesander is about to exit, Bill, dressed, starts down the 
               stairs.

                                     BILL
                         Oh, Mr. Tesander -- could you give 
                         me a lift to town?

                                     TESANDER
                         Yep.

                                     BILL
                         Be right with you.

               INT. LIVING ROOM

                                     MURIEL
                              (concerned)
                         What did you mean before about losing 
                         your job? Will we really have to 
                         sell the house?

                                     JIM
                              (miserable)
                         I don't know, dear... I don't know.

               Bill enters.

                                     BILL
                         In case anyone's interested, I'm 
                         leaving for town.
                              (for Jim's benefit)
                         If you want to count the silverware, 
                         I'll wait.

                                     JIM
                              (sheepishly)
                         Bill, be patient with me. Maybe one 
                         of these days I'll grow up.

                                     BILL
                              (to Muriel)
                         What happened to him?

                                     MURIEL
                         Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.

                                     BILL
                         Mind if I say something?

               Jim and Muriel look at him curiously.

                                     BILL
                         You know, I've kind of been the voice 
                         of doom about this whole project. 
                         Every step of the way I was firmly 
                         convinced you were getting fleeced, 
                         bilked, rooked, flimflammed and 
                         generally taken to the cleaners. And 
                         maybe you were. Maybe it cost you a 
                         whole lot more than you thought it 
                         would. Maybe there were times when 
                         you wished you'd never started the 
                         whole thing. But when I look around 
                         and see what you two have here -- I 
                         don't know.
                              (pause)
                         Maybe there are some things you should 
                         buy with your heart and not with 
                         your head. Maybe those are the things 
                         that really count... See you around.

               As Bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening 
               and the kids appear. There is an exchange of "Hi's" as they 
               pass.

                                     BETSY
                         'Morning, everybody!

                              (surprised)

                         office?

                         I'm on a... kind of a vacation.

                                     JOAN
                         You mean you got fired?

                                     JIM
                         Well, not exactly, I --

                         We'll discuss it later.

               Gussie's head appears from the kitchen.

                                     GUSSIE
                              (brightly)

                         Good! I'm starving! What are we 
                         having, Gussie?

                                     GUSSIE
                         Orange juice, scrambled eggs and you-
                         know-what.

                                     JOAN
                              (making a face)
                         Ham?

                                     GUSSIE
                         Not ham -- Wham!
                              (cheerily)

                         eatin' ham!

               Gussie's head disappears.

               He reacts with the sudden exhilaration of Balboa first seeing 
               the Pacific. He snaps his fingers.

                         Darling, give Gussie a ten dollar 
                         raise!

               His eyes light up as he begins to visualize.

                                                                   DISSOLVE

               THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Mr. James Blandings 
               reclining in a hammock on the patio of his Dream House. In 
               the b.g. Muriel is working at her garden, Joan and Betsy 
               assisting her. Jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he 
               sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and 
               picks up a book which he has been reading. As the CAMERA 
               COMES IN for an EXTREME CLOSE SHOT of Jim we see the title 
               of the book on the jacket cover. It reads:

                          "MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE"

               Jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the 
               camera and winks.

                         locate the lucky man. When I do, it's 
                         your job to keep the newspapers away 
                         from him.

                         in?

                         Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town 
                         all right.

                         Well, I dropped everything at the office 
                         - I hope it's not a wild goose chase.

                         No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He 
                         lives here all right.

                         Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him.
 
                                                              
                         CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they cross 
                         to a small, one-story old brick building, 
                         covered with ivy. This is the ticket 
                         and freight office combined. In front 
                         of it is a very old man, a stoop-

                         shouldered rail agent with a face of 
                         a million wrinkles - puttering around 
                         some packages.

                         Good morning.

                         Morning, neighbors. Morning.
                                     
                         He picks up a package and disappears 
                         into the building. Cedar and Cobb look 
                         at each other.

                         That's an excellent start. At least 
                         we've broken the ice.
                                      
                         The old man returns to his pile of packages.

                         Deeds.

                         He again disappears.

                         The old man shows up again.

                         We'd like to get in touch with him. 
                         It's very important.

                         Oh, yes - Deeds. Fine fellow. Very democratic. 
                         You won't have no trouble at all. Talk 
                         to anybody.
                                      
                         Whereupon the old man carries another 
                         package inside. Cobb is properly exasperated 
                         now.

                         jack comes out, I'll straddle him while 
                         you ask him your questions.
                                      
                         The old man emerges from the building 
                         and looks up at them as if he's never 
                         seen them before.

                         Cobb grabs the old man as he turns to 
                         head back into the building.

                         He turns again - but Cobb holds him 
                         by the arm and sets him down on a small 
                         packing case.

                         All you got to do is ask.

                         Cobb turns away in disgust. Anderson 
                         steps forward.

                         didn't you say so in the first place 
                         instead of beating around the bush? 
                         Those other fellows don't know what 
                         they're talking about.

                         a chair. He takes a mouthpiece out of 
                         his pocket.

                         New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks 
                         for this. Kids keep swiping them all 
                         the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.

                         Longfellow looks at them strangely and 
                         sits down beside his tuba.

                         Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. 
                         I never saw him, but my mother's name 
                         was Semple, you know.

                         While he speaks, he has been adjusting 
                         the tuba between his legs and now sucks 
                         on the mouthpiece, preparatory to playing.

                         left a large fortune when he died. He 
                         left it all to you, Mr. Deeds. Deducting 
                         the taxes, it amounts to something in

                         His lips are over the mouthpiece of

                         news is to lift his eyes in Cedar's 
                         direction.

                         and are now even more astounded to see

                         The band has already begun and is now 
                         in the midst of "For He's A Jolly Good 
                         Fellow."
                                      
                         At this moment, as he looks off, a startled 
                         expression comes into Cobb's eyes. He 
                         grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances 
                         in the direction he points.

                         Cedar and Cobb stare, wide-eyed, as 
                         the song is finished.

                         In the b.g. is the train with Longfellow 
                         standing on the observation platform, 
                         clutching his tuba. On either side of 
                         him is Cedar and Cobb. In the f.g. the 
                         crowd yells its farewell. Several of 
                         them stuff baskets of fruit into his 
                         hands. The band plays "Auld Lang Syne."

                         As the train begins pulling out. Longfellow 
                         smiles wanly and waves.

                         Cobb looks up into Longfellow's face

                         Longfellow is slumped in his seat, his

                         - in deep thought. Cobb sits across 
                         from him. Cedar enters, hangs up his

                         a large fortune like this entails a

                         The men come to life. Some rise - others 
                         lean forward. Two of them are brothers 
                         of Cedar - tall and athletic. The third 
                         is a small, frightened-looking man. 
                         He is Budington.

                         What happened?

                         leaning against the wall near the door, 
                         apparently indifferent, is Babe Bennett. 
                         The editor, Mac, is haranguing them.

                         He's news! Every time he blows his nose, 
                         it's news. A corn-fed bohunk like that 
                         falling into the Semple fortune is hot 
                         copy . . . But it's got to be personal. 
                         It's got to have an angle. What does 
                         he think about? How does it feel to 
                         be a millionaire! Is he going to get 
                         married! What does he think of New York! 
                         Is he smart? Is he dumb? . . . A million 
                         angles!

                         She has a string in her hand which she 
                         keeps flicking, trying to get a knot 
                         into it - in the manner of cowboys with 
                         a rope. Mac's voice continues over scene:

                         Longfellow stands awkwardly between

                         Well, outside of your regular fee, how 
                         much extra will it cost?

                         That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't 
                         it?

                         Yes, but that's an added service a firm 
                         like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington

                         was a fellow named Winslow here a little 
                         while ago, wanted to handle my affairs 
                         for nothing too. It puzzles me why these 
                         people all want to work for nothing. 
                         It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better 
                         think about it some more.

                         by you, Mr. Cedar - I don't care how 
                         important you are.

                         Mr. Deeds, I represent Mrs. Semple.

                         Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She 
                         has a legal claim on the estate.

                         We'll let the courts decide what her 
                         legal position is.

                         You wouldn't dare go into court with 
                         a case like this - and you know it!

                         to them studyingly.

                         I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you 
                         conceive of any court not being in sympathy 
                         with any woman who gave up the best 
                         years of her life for an old man like 
                         your uncle?

                         Common-law wife. On top of that, there's 
                         a child.

                         That's awful. The poor woman should 
                         be taken care of immediately.

                         I'm glad to see you're willing to be 
                         reasonable, Mr. Deeds.

                         If she was his wife, she should have 
                         all the money. That's only fair. I don't 
                         want a penny of it.
                                      
                         He yanks his trousers off and hands 
                         them to the tailor.

                         A group of eight distinguished-looking 
                         men sit around a long table, awaiting 
                         Longfellow's arrival. At the head of

                         man's quite childish. I don't think 
                         we'll have any difficulty in getting 
                         him to put up the entire amount. After 
                         all, it's only a matter of $180,000.

                         coming from?

                         They all stare at Longfellow. Over scene 
                         comes the low wailing cry of a siren, 
                         which increases in volume as it gets 
                         closer to the building.

                         He rushes to the window and peers out. 
                         The others stare unbelievably. The shriek 
                         of the siren finally dies down. Longfellow 
                         turns back.

                         certainly is a business to me, if I 
                         have to make up a loss of $180,000. 
                         If it's losing that much money, there 
                         must be something wrong. Maybe you charge 
                         too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. 
                         Maybe lots of things. I don't know. 
                         You see, I expect to do a lot of good 
                         with that money. And I can't afford 
                         to put it into anything that I don't

                         Besides, there's something fishy about 
                         a person who would settle for a million 
                         dollars when they can get seven million. 
                         I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's 
                         supposed to be a smart man, couldn't 
                         see through that.

                         Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing 
                         a coat and hat. He comes to the top 
                         of a grand staircase, looks around slyly 
                         and sees that no one is watching. He 
                         slides down the bannister and touches 
                         the statue at the bottom for good luck.
 
                                                              
                         He starts for the door. When he gets 
                         there he finds his way barred by two 
                         husky-looking mugs. He looks up surprised.

                         Longfellow glances around the room thoughtfully,

                         The first bodyguard eagerly takes out

                         The two bodyguards accommodatingly enter 
                         a closet. The moment they are gone,

                         turns the key.

                         Bennett. Her eyes are closed, apparently 
                         in a dead faint.

                         just dashes them off.

                         Yes. That's what my publishers have 
                         been complaining about.

                         if he's aware that he is being laughed 
                         at. But he apparently isn't.

                         several steps. Then he abruptly stops.

                         There's just one thing more. If it weren't 
                         for Miss Dawson being here with me, 
                         I'd probably bump your heads together.

                         Longfellow stares at her for a moment.

                         He starts back toward the table.

                         Protectively, Brookfield and Henaberry 
                         rise from their chairs. But they are 
                         too late, for Longfellow clips Brookfield 
                         on the chin first with his left fist 
                         - and with his right catches Henaberry 
                         on the jaw. The punches are almost simultaneous. 
                         The surprise attack catches the men 
                         off-guard and they fall backward. A 
                         waiter rushes forward to escort Longfellow 
                         and Babe out.

                         and who has watched Longfellow with 
                         great admiration, now rises to catch 
                         up to him.

                         Babe, who are on their way out. The 
                         waiter is shooing people away.

                         Longfellow and Babe smile. As Morrow 
                         continues to speak, he sways drunkenly 
                         and would fall over backwards a couple 
                         of times in midsentence if the alert

                         If you'll permit me to say so, sir, 
                         you were out on quite a bender last 
                         night, sir.

                         Longfellow opens one eye - and then 
                         the other, blinking. As consciousness 
                         returns to him, he glances around the 
                         room as if to get his bearings.

                         Bender? You're wrong, Walter. We started 
                         out to a binge but we never got to it.

                         Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
 
                                                              
                         Longfellow takes it and downs it in

                         Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone 
                         number on a piece of paper.

                         Longfellow looks up slowly. Walter goes 
                         on:

                         As a matter of fact, you came home without 
                         any clothes. You were in your - uh - 
                         shorts. Yes, sir.

                         walk around in the streets without any 
                         clothes. I'd be arrested.

                         They said you and another gentleman 
                         kept walking up and down the streets, 
                         shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are 
                         a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"

                         Slowly it is all coming back to him.

                         be a great author, but I think he's 
                         crazy. The man's crazy, Walter.

                         Longfellow slowly swings out of bed 
                         into a sitting position. Walter kneels 
                         to put on Longfellow's slippers. Longfellow 
                         balks, points, silently reminding Walter 
                         that he has broken his promise not to 
                         kneel down in front of him.

                         Longfellow's expression begs no disagreement. 
                         Walter stands, fumbling with the shoes 
                         from a stooped posture.

                         Following Walter's exit. Longfellow

                         You must have met a lot of swell society 
                         girls since you've been here. Don't

                         particularly. They all seem to have 
                         the St. Vitus Dance.[12]

                         walking along and looking at the tall 
                         buildings and I got to thinking about 
                         what Thoreau said. They created a lot 
                         of grand palaces here - but they forgot 
                         to create the noblemen to put in them.

                         Babe leans her head back in a reminiscent

                         moment, she has forgotten she is Babe

                         Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun 
                         there when I was a little girl. I used 
                         to love to go fishing with my father. 
                         That's funny. He was a lot like you, 
                         my father was. Talked like you, too. 
                         Sometimes he'd let me hold the line 
                         while he smoked - and we'd just sit 
                         there for hours. And after awhile, for 
                         no reason, I'd go over and kiss him 
                         and sit in his lap. He never said very 
                         much but once I remember him saying: 
                         "No matter what happens, honey, don't 
                         complain."

                         He sounds like a person worth while 
                         knowing.
                                      
                         There is a pause while Longfellow watches 
                         her, and she is lost in thought.

                         out of scene. Over the shot we hear 
                         the low moan of a siren in the distance.

                         They reach the climax of their song 
                         - and laugh joyously. At this moment, 
                         the shrieking of the siren is nearer 
                         and louder. Longfellow looks up quickly. 
                         Excited, he jumps up and runs toward 
                         street. Babe looks up, surprised.

                         see how they do it. Wait for me, will 
                         you?

                         As the fire engine slows down - and 
                         people are beginning to gather. We see 
                         Longfellow running toward the truck 
                         and hopping aboard.

                         staring at the sheet of paper in front 
                         of her. Her eyes have a distant look.

                         Several feet away from her Mabel Dawson 
                         stands in front of an easel, working 
                         silently on a painting. She dabs at 
                         it and turning, pauses a moment to watch 
                         Babe, who at the moment rests her forehead 
                         on the typewriter carriage.

                         Babe is too much absorbed to hear this. 
                         Getting no response, Mabel turns and 
                         studies her for a few seconds.

                         Babe lights a cigarette. Mabel studies 
                         her.

                         Madame Pomponi. She says everything 
                         is all set for the reception.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         What do you mean by coming in here when 
                         I'm playing?
                                      
                         WALTER
                                     
                         But she's on the telephone
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Get out.
                                     
                         (pointing)
                                     
                         The evil finger's on you. Get out!
 
                                                              
                         Walter hurries out. Longfellow jumps 
                         up and chases him down the grand staircase. 
                         Longfellow stops at the top of the stairs, 
                         struck by an idea.
                                      
                         INT. GRAND STAIRCASE

                         Showing Walter at the bottom of the 
                         stairs and Longfellow at the top.

                         Stop!
                                     
                         Walter halts. Longfellow gives a shout 
                         from the top of the stairs. There is 
                         a discernible echo.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Hey, did you hear that?
                                     
                         WALTER
                                     
                         What, sir?

                         Longfellow gives another shout. There 
                         is another echo. He tries it again - 
                         louder. Another echo. It is all very 
                         satisfactory.
                                      
                         WALTER

                         Why, that's an echo, sir!
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         You try it.
                                     
                         WALTER

                         Me, sir?
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (an order)
                                     
                         Yeah.
                                     
                         Walter gives a bird-like hoot. There 
                         is an echo.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (firmly)
                                     
                         Louder.
                                     
                         Walter gives a louder hoot. And louder. 
                         Each time, an echo.
                                      
                         A butler in a bathrobe emerges to see 
                         what all the hullabaloo is about. Longfellow 
                         spots him.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (to butler)
                                     
                         You try it.
                                     
                         BUTLER
                                     
                         Me, sir?
                                     
                         But the butler clearly relishes the 
                         opportunity. He gives a little high-pitched 
                         squeak.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Louder!
                                     
                         The butler tries it again - much better. 
                         Another man-servant has emerged. Longfellow 
                         points to him.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         You try it!
                                     
                         The man-servant tries it - very raspy, 
                         another tone altogether.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (waving like a conductor)
                                     
                         All together!
                                     
                         A symphony of hoots, shrieks, barks 
                         and echoes.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Again!
                                     
                         The household staff do it again.
                                     
                         ? 405 ?
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (surveying the scene - then, dramatically)
 
                                                              
                         Let that be a lesson to you.
                                     
                         With that, Longfellow spins on his heel 
                         and returns to his bedroom.
                                      
                         There is a pause. The butler takes command 
                         of the other two.
                                      
                         BUTLER
                                     
                         (gesturing imperiously)
                                     
                         Go back to your room, both of you!
 
                                                              
                         Walter and the man-servant hasten to 
                         exit.
                                      
                         The butler waits until nobody is looking, 
                         then gives one, final hoot. He murmurs 
                         to himself with satisfaction as he exits.

                         Madame Pomponi greets a group of guests. 
                         Ad-lib chatter is heard. From inside 
                         music emanates.

                         So good of you to come.

                         I'm just dying to see the "Cinderella

                         CAMERA MOVES SWIFTLY among groups of 
                         people picking out vignettes of conversation. 
                         Longfellow is the hot topic.
                                      
                         A husband and a wife whispering:
                                     
                         A HUSBAND
                                     
                         Shh! - he may hear you.
                                     
                         A WIFE
                                     
                         Even if he heard you, he wouldn't understand.
 
                                                              
                         A man and a woman gossiping:
                                     
                         A MAN
                                     
                         I hear he still believes in Santa Claus.

                         Will he be Santa Claus? That's what 
                         I want to know.
                                      
                         Another man holding forth to two elegantly-dressed

                         ANOTHER MAN

                         Babe is listlessly packing her few things 
                         in a small handbag. She slowly and meticulously 
                         folds a silken undergarment, wrapping 
                         it in tissue. Her eyes have a distant 
                         look. Mabel watches her, concerned. 
                         There is a long pause before either 
                         of them speaks.

                         You're a fool, Babe.

                         got a job in China - some place.

                         What else can I do? Keeping this up 
                         is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.

                         entrance of Bob and Frank, whose voices 
                         are heard as they barge in.

                         hides her bag - and follows Mabel to 
                         greet them in the living room.

                         Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. 
                         Yes, I've been her sister for a long 
                         time.

                         They look at each other stupidly - smiling

                         know whether she's home or not. I'll 
                         see.
                                      
                         As she turns, Babe appears in doorway.

                         As they walk slowly down the front steps.

                         The reason why I wanted to take a walk, 
                         Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to 
                         you.

                         As they walk along a foggy street, on 
                         their faces.

                         Continuing on them, as they slowly walk 
                         around the block.

                         A man ought to know where he fits in. 
                         I just don't fit in around here. I once 
                         had an idea I could do something with 
                         the money, but they kept me so busy 
                         here, I haven't had time to figure it 
                         out. I guess I'll wait till I get back 
                         home.
                                      
                         There is a long pause. Both lost in 
                         their own thoughts.

                         Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? 
                         You don't have to pay any attention 
                         to me.

                         All my life, I've wanted somebody to 
                         talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always 
                         used to talk to a girl.

                         A girl?

                         Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike 
                         a lot through the woods and I'd always 
                         take this girl
                                      
                         ? 412 ?
                                     
                         with me so I could talk to her. I'd 
                         show her my pet trees and things. Sounds 
                         kind of silly but we had a lot of fun 
                         doing it.
                                      
                         (smiling)
                                     
                         She was beautiful.
                                     
                         (then moodily)
                                     
                         I haven't married 'cause I've been kinda 
                         waiting. You know, my mother and father 
                         were a great couple. I thought I might 
                         have the same kind of luck. I've always 
                         hoped that some day that imaginary girl 
                         would turn out to be real.
                                      
                         They have arrived back at the front 
                         steps of Babe's home.

                         You're much too real. You go back to

                         His hand goes to his breast pocket - 
                         and then slowly is withdrawn - without 
                         bringing out the poem.

                         He now takes the poem out. The paper 
                         is folded. He hands it to her and she 
                         slowly unfolds it. Just as she is about 
                         to read Longfellow lays a hand on her 
                         arm.

                         You don't have to say anything, Mary. 
                         You can tell me tomorrow what you think.
 
                                                              
                         She looks into his eyes, but does not 
                         respond. Then she holds the paper up 
                         and begins reading. Longfellow watches 
                         her anxiously.

                         He hovers over them, checking their 
                         preparations.

                         Longfellow shifts his glance over to 
                         the photograph in the newspaper Cobb 
                         holds up, and slowly his grip on Cobb

                         wry smile appears on his face and, rising, 
                         he wanders around the room in deep abstraction. 
                         Cobb and Walter watch him sympathetically.
 
                                                              
                         Longfellow is silent a long time.

                         Cobb backs away and the man points the 
                         gun at Longfellow, who remains staring 
                         at him, immobilely.

                         up and brushes away a tear with a rough 
                         hand. It seems to bring him to his senses. 
                         He glances down and seeing the gun in 
                         his hand - stares at it in surprise. 
                         He realizes what he was about to do.

                         gun drops to the floor. Cobb bends quickly 
                         and picks it up. Longfellow never moves.

                         He turns his head slowly and peers at 
                         them with non-seeing eyes, then suddenly 
                         he hides his face in his hands and sobs.

                         The rest of it seems to come out of 
                         him effortfully - his voice breaking.

                         Longfellow was peering into the man's 
                         face intently. As the man finishes

                         The man sits, eating. He seriously bends 
                         over his food. Longfellow sits opposite 
                         him - his eyes glued on the man, absorbed 
                         in profound thought.

                         Longfellow is seated by the far wall, 
                         peering moodily out the window. Cobb 
                         paces about. Suddenly, he wheels on 
                         Longfellow.

                         back and let them railroad you? It's 
                         as pretty a frameup as ever hit this 
                         rotten town! If you'd just let me get

                         Longfellow pays no attention to him.

                         array of talent he's got lined up against 
                         you - you're cooked!

                         Longfellow is still unresponsive. Cobb 
                         thinks a moment, watching him studiously; 
                         then pleading tenderly:

                         A blonde in Syracuse put me through 
                         the same paces. I came out with a sour 
                         puss - but full of fight. Come on, you 
                         don't want to lay down now.
                                      
                         Longfellow is still unresponsive.

                         trying to prove that you're nuts! If 
                         they win the case, they'll shove you 
                         in the bughouse. The moment they accuse 
                         you of it, they have you half licked. 
                         You've got to fight!
                                      
                         Longfellow disregards him and Cobb sighs, 
                         resignedly.

                         Cobb, in a troubled frame of mind, doesn't 
                         respond and starts down corridor - CAMERA 
                         TRUCKS WITH HIM. Babe catches up with 
                         him.

                         The judge is not yet at his bench. There 
                         is a general chatter of excitement and 
                         anticipation.

                         Among the spectators Babe sits beside 
                         Mac. She stares, expression-less. Mac 
                         glances at her sympathetically.

                         Featuring the farmer who broke into 
                         Longfellow's house. Near him is the 
                         Swede we saw - and others.

                         Cedar and his assistants arrange their 
                         papers. Two dignified gentlemen, psychiatrists, 
                         await action, arms folded. Near them 
                         is Henry Semple, the complainant, his 
                         nose twitching nervously. By his side 
                         is his wife, sparkling expectantly.

                         At which sit a dozen newspaper reporters.

                         From a side door Longfellow enters, 
                         accompanied by his guard. Immediately 
                         the place is astir. As he advances to 
                         a chair in front of a table

                         Necks crane for a glimpse. Whispered 
                         conversations take place.

                         He looks guilty, nose twitching more 
                         violently than ever.

                         Babe sits up, her eyes riveted on Longfellow. 
                         Impulsively she starts to rise, but 
                         Mac puts a restraining hand on her.

                         Longfellow turns neither to left nor 
                         right. He is slumped low in his chair, 
                         staring solemnly into space. Cobb breaks 
                         into scene and sits down beside him.

                         Cedar just sent for me. Wants to make 
                         a settlement. Here's your chance to 
                         get out of the whole mess. What do you 
                         say?
                                      
                         He gets no response from Longfellow.
 
                                                              
                         There is a stir in the courtroom.

                         To include Judge and Longfellow.

                         The court wishes to warn those present 
                         that it will tolerate no disturbances.

                         Regarding the sanity hearing of Longfellow 
                         Deeds, are you represented by counsel, 
                         Mr. Deeds?

                         Almost imperceptibly, Longfellow shakes 
                         his head no. The Judge looks troubled. 
                         There is a stir in the courtroom.
 
                                                              
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         I understand that you have no counsel, 
                         Mr. Deeds. In fact, that you have no 
                         intention of defending any of these 
                         charges. Now, if you wish to change 
                         your mind, the hearing can be postponed.
 
                                                              
                         Getting no response from Longfellow, 
                         the Judge shrugs his shoulders.

                         late Martin W. Semple, we cannot permit 
                         a fortune so huge to be dissipated by

                         I have before me a series of articles 
                         written by a newspaper woman who was 
                         an eye-witness to his conduct ever since 
                         he came to New York.
                                      
                         CAMERA STOPS on Babe and Mac. Cedar's 
                         voice goes on:
                                      
                         CEDAR
                                     
                         She tells how, in the midst of a normal 
                         conversation, he would suddenly begin 
                         playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks 
                         upon several of our eminent writers 
                         - for no apparent reason. In fact, there 
                         are many instances not recorded in these 
                         articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied 
                         an unnatural desire to smash people 
                         up without provocation.

                         I, myself, unable to keep pace with 
                         his mental quirks, and constantly fearful 
                         of assault, turned down an opportunity 
                         to represent him as his attorney. This 
                         newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed 
                         to testify, tells how he tied up traffic 
                         for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor 
                         horse. And by his own statement, waiting 
                         for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee.

                         There is laughter in the courtroom - 
                         which quickly subsides when the Judge 
                         pounds his gavel.

                         We have photographs to substantiate 
                         this little episode, and other photographs 
                         showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire 
                         engine. This scarcely sounds like the 
                         action of a man in whom the disposition 
                         of twenty million dollars may safely 
                         be entrusted. This writer of these articles 
                         - a woman whose intelligence and integrity 
                         in the newspaper world is unquestioned 
                         - held him in such contempt that she 
                         quite aptly named him "The Cinderella 
                         Man."

                         We have witnesses here from Mandrake 
                         Falls, his own home town, who will tell 
                         of his conduct throughout his lifetime, 
                         proving that his derangement is neither 
                         recent nor a temporary one.
                                      
                         Longfellow's interest is only slightly 
                         aroused. He lifts his eyes in a casual 
                         glance around him.

                         We have others who will tell of his 
                         unusual behavior when he invited the 
                         great leaders of the musical world to 
                         his home, and then proceeded to forcibly 
                         eject them. Only recently when he was 
                         in the County Hospital for observation, 
                         he not only refused to be examined by 
                         these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, 
                         but he actually made a violent attack 
                         upon them.

                         In these times, with the country incapacitated

                         with an undercurrent of social unrest, 
                         the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic 
                         and impractical plan as contemplated 
                         by the defendant, is capable of fomenting 
                         a disturbance from which the country 
                         may not soon recover. It is our duty 
                         to stop it! Our government is fully 
                         aware of its difficulties and can pull 
                         itself out of its economic rut without 
                         the assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any 
                         other crackpot.

                         There is a mild stir, and all wait expectantly 
                         for Babe to appear.

                         Babe, eyes on Longfellow, slowly walks 
                         to the stand.

                         She does so.

                         As Cedar steps up to question Babe.

                         There is no answer. Babe continues to 
                         stare off at Longfellow, hoping he will 
                         look up. Cedar speaks to her again:

                         But Babe's attention remains focused 
                         on Longfellow.

                         done in an orderly fashion. When you 
                         have learned to show some respect for

                         Two old ladies are being led to the 
                         witness stand. Their eyelids flutter 
                         excitedly as they go.

                         He looks up, sees the old ladies and 
                         smiles at them friendily.

                         The Falkner sisters are rather timid, 
                         Your Honor, and wish to be together. 
                         If the court pleases, I will only have 
                         one of them testify.

                         Cedar turns to them.

                         I'll direct my questions to you, Miss 
                         Jane. You can answer for both. Do you 
                         know the defendant, Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
 
                                                              
                         The two old ladies look at each other, 
                         then in the direction in which Cedar 
                         points.

                         Jane turns to her sister, and they whisper 
                         to each other.

                         Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife.

                         Thank you, that's fine. Do you see him 
                         very often?
                                      
                         The two old ladies have their whispered 
                         conference again.

                         Now, will you tell the Court what everybody 
                         at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?

                         They think he's pixilated.

                         Now, that's a rather strange word to 
                         use, Miss Jane. Can you tell the court 
                         exactly what it means?
                                      
                         While the two ladies go into a huddle:

                         Perhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The 
                         word pixilated is an early American 
                         expression - derived from the word 'pixies,' 
                         meaning elves. They would say, 'The 
                         pixies had got him,' as we nowadays 
                         would say a man is 'balmy.'

                         Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement.

                         he's - uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar 
                         things?

                         For no reason, I guess. He always does 
                         it. We always run into the house when 
                         we see him coming.

                         Especially, the one of the young nobleman, 
                         you remember?

                         Oh, yes. Yes, of course Dr. Von Holler. 
                         Very interesting.

                         It reminds me very much of this one. 
                         Nicht wahr?
                                      
                         DR. FOSDICK
                                     
                         Ja.

                         because their mood changes so often 
                         and so quickly. Now, Your Honor, may 
                         I show you? May I use the chart?

                         By all means.
                                     
                         He moves to a blackboard. There are 
                         chalk marks on it. A straight line runs 
                         diagonally across the center. Other 
                         lines run zig-zag over and below this 
                         center line.

                         Below here, they are extremely depressed, 
                         melancholy, impossible to live with, 
                         and often become violent.

                         From this mood the manic depressive 
                         might gradually change until they reach 
                         this state.
                                      
                         (he reaches the center line)
                                     
                         Here is lucidity. Here they are perfectly 
                         normal. As normal as you or I
                                      
                         (smiling)
                                     
                         assuming, of course, that we are normal.
 
                                                              
                         (he starts up with chalk)
                                     
                         Then, the mood changes again until

                         they reach this state, a state of highest 
                         exaltation. Here everything is fine. 
                         Here the world is beautiful. Here they 
                         are so elated - how do you express it?
 
                                                              
                         (quickly, as it comes to him)
                                     
                         they would give you the shirt off their 
                         backs!

                         Dr. Von Holler, how would you say that 
                         applied to Mr. Deeds's case?
                                      
                         VON HOLLER
                                     
                         The symptoms are obvious.
                                     
                         (points to top line)
                                     
                         When he was here, on top of the wave, 
                         he felt nothing but kindliness and warmth 
                         toward his fellow-men. He wanted them 
                         around him. So he decided he would give 
                         a big reception. But in the meantime, 
                         his mood has changed.
                                      
                         (chalk goes down)
                                     
                         He is now at the bottom of the wave 
                         - depressed - melancholy. So, when his 
                         guests arrive, he throws them out. They 
                         are now his imaginary enemies.

                         As Von Holler's voice continues:

                         Other instances of high elation are 
                         when he plays his tuba, when he writes 
                         his poetry, when he chases fire engines 
                         in his desire to help humanity. This 
                         is contrasted with his present mood, 
                         which is so low that even the instinct 
                         for self-preservation is lacking.

                         Oh, the man is verrukt. Your Honor, 
                         this is decidedly a case of a manic 
                         depressive.

                         your own safety that you be committed 
                         to an institution as prescribed by law. 
                         You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds.

                         Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a 
                         tribute to American womanhood - the 
                         instinct to protect the weak. I'm not 
                         saying that nobody likes the boy. I 
                         cherish a fond affection for him myself. 
                         But that doesn't mean to say
                                      
                         In the middle of his speech, Mac - the 
                         editor - appears at his elbow.

                         When the windbag here gets through, 
                         Your Honor, I'd like to verify what 
                         Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When 
                         she quit her job, she told me what a 
                         swell fellow this man was. And anything 
                         Babe Bennett says is okay with me.
 
                                                              
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         If you have anything to say, you will 
                         take the stand.

                         I've already said it, Your Honor. I 
                         just thought I'd like to get my two 
                         cents in.
                                      
                         As he starts to go, CAMERA PANNING WITH 
                         HIM, he passes Longfellow. He nudges 
                         him.

                         speak your piece.
                                      
                         He disappears to his seat.

                         I've been with this man ever since he 
                         came to New York

                         Shooting toward the Judge. He pounds 
                         his gavel, interrupting Cobb.

                         Almost simultaneously with the Judge's 
                         speech, the farmer, somewhere in the 
                         audience, rises to his feet.

                         Shooting toward audience. As the farmer 
                         finishes, a dozen others are on their 
                         feet.

                         You're not going to leave us out in

                         The turmoil is general, with bailiffs 
                         running to quiet them. The Judge pounding 
                         his gavel, incensed.

                         In the interest of Mr. Deeds, I have 
                         tolerated a great deal of informality. 
                         But if there is one more outburst, I 
                         shall have the courtroom cleared.

                         About my playing the tuba. Seems like 
                         a lot of fuss has been made about that. 
                         If a man's crazy just 'cause he plays 
                         the tuba, then somebody better look 
                         into it, 'cause there are a lot of tuba 
                         players running around loose. Of course, 
                         I don't see any harm in it. I play mine 
                         whenever I want to concentrate. That 
                         may sound funny to some people - but 
                         everybody does something silly when 
                         they're thinking. For instance, the

                         That's a name we made up back home for 
                         people who make foolish designs on paper 
                         when they're thinking. It's called doodling. 
                         Almost everybody's a doodler. Did you 
                         ever see a scratch pad in a telephone 
                         booth? People draw the most idiotic 
                         pictures when they're thinking. Dr. 
                         Von Holler, here, could probably think 
                         up a long name for it, because he doodles 
                         all the time.
                                      
                         Dr. Von Holler, who is in the middle 
                         of some doodling, flinches. A roar of 
                         laughter comes from the spectators. 
                         Longfellow reaches over to where Dr. 
                         Von Holler sits and picks up a piece 
                         of paper.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (to Dr. Von Holler)
                                     
                         Thank you.
                                     
                         (returning to the stand)
                                     
                         This is a piece of paper he was scribbling 
                         on.
                                      
                         (scrutinizes it)
                                     
                         I can't figure it out. One minute it 
                         looks like a chimpanzee - and the next 
                         minute it looks like a picture of Mr. 
                         Cedar.
                                      
                         (hands it to him)
                                     
                         You look at it, Judge.
                                     
                         The Judge, with a serious mien, takes 
                         the paper.
                                      
                         INSERT: OF PAPER
                                     
                         It is a doodle face.
                                     
                         BACK TO SCENE:
                                     
                         Dr. Von Holler is somewhat uncomfortable.
 
                                                              
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Exhibit A - for the defense.
                                     
                         (after a pause)
                                     
                         Looks kind of stupid, doesn't it, Your 
                         Honor? But I guess that's all right 
                         if Dr. Von Holler has to doodle to help 
                         him think. That's his business. Everybody 
                         does something different. Some people 
                         are
                                      
                         (demonstrates)
                                     
                         ear-pullers - some are nail-biters
 
                                                              
                         (pointing)
                                     
                         That Mr. Semple over there is a nose-twitcher.
 
                                                              
                         333. CLOSE SHOT - SEMPLE AND HIS WIFE
 
                                                              
                         He looks up, startled, his nose twitching 
                         more violently than ever. The courtroom 
                         rocks with laughter.
                                      
                         His wife, in her nervousness, pulls 
                         at her fingers.
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW'S VOICE
                                     
                         And the lady next to him is a knuckle-cracker.
 
                                                              
                         Mrs. Semple quickly drops her hands 
                         in her lap, as the courtroom again fills 
                         with laughter.

                         He swings a key-ring around his forefinger. 
                         Suddenly he realizes Longfellow might 
                         get to him, and he hastily palms the 
                         keys and shoves them in his pocket.

                         One is leaning forward, listening intently 
                         - biting the end of his pencil. The 
                         one next to him nudges him and silently 
                         points to the pencil in his mouth. The 
                         reporter gets the idea and, smiling 
                         sheepishly, yanks it out of his mouth.

                         So you see, everybody does silly things 
                         to help them think.
                                      
                         (in conclusion)

                         The crowd echoes him with shouts and 
                         laughter.

                         He glares off scene at Mac, reprimandingly.

                         JUDGE
                                     
                         Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting 
                         people from your home?
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those 
                         people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi 
                         told the truth. I did throw them out 
                         because I didn't want the party in the 
                         first place. I didn't invite anybody. 
                         Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just 
                         came to see what kind of a freak the 
                         "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how 
                         people like that are supposed to act, 
                         Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman 
                         is an example, I'll stick to simple 
                         folks. She just came in, talked my ear 
                         off, and took charge of everything. 
                         If I were a friend of hers, I'd have 
                         her examined.

                         stand it any longer, jumps to his feet.

                         Your Honor, this is becoming farcical. 
                         I demand that Mr. Deeds dispense with 
                         side remarks and confine himself to 
                         facts! Let him explain his wanderings 
                         around the streets in underclothes, 
                         his feeding doughnuts to horses!
                                      
                         JUDGE'S VOICE
                                     
                         Proceed.

                         Mr. Cedar's right. Those things do look 
                         kind of bad, don't they? But to tell 
                         the truth, Your Honor, I don't remember 
                         them. I guess they happened, all right, 
                         because I don't think a policeman would 
                         lie about a thing like that, but I was 
                         drunk. It was the first time I was ever 
                         drunk in my life. It's probably happened 
                         to you, some time. I mean, when you 
                         were younger, of course.
                                      
                         The Judge clears his throat in embarrassment. 
                         Several women giggle. The Judge sternly 
                         pounds his gavel.

                         It's likely to happen to anybody. Just 
                         the other morning I read in the paper 
                         about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how 
                         he got drunk and insisted on driving 
                         a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. 
                         Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that 
                         so , Mr. Cedar?
                                      
                         344. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM
                                     
                         All eyes have turned to Cedar.
                                     
                         345. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR
                                     
                         His eyes are beginning to blaze angrily.

                         Your Honor, I object.

                         Proceed.

                         Now about the Falkner sisters. That's 
                         kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar 
                         going all the way to Mandrake Falls 
                         to bring them here. Do you mind if I 
                         talk to them?
                                      
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         Not at all.
                                     
                         Longfellow turns. Everybody stretches 
                         to get a better look at them.

                         Jane, who owns the house you live in?

                         The girls consult with each other.
 
                                                              
                         JANE
                                     
                         Why, you own it, Longfellow.
                                     
                         AMY
                                     
                         Yes, you own it.
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW'S VOICE
                                     
                         Do you pay any rent?
                                     
                         JANE
                                     
                         (after conferring with Amy)
                                     
                         No, we don't pay any rent.
                                     
                         AMY
                                     
                         Good heavens, no! We never pay rent.

                         As Longfellow continues questioning:

                         Are you happy there?
                                     
                         JANE
                                     
                         Oh, yes.
                                     
                         AMY
                                     
                         Yes, indeed.
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Now, Jane, a little while ago you said 
                         I was pixilated. Do you still think 
                         so?
                                      
                         JANE
                                     
                         (after the usual conference)
                                     
                         Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow.
 
                                                              
                         AMY
                                     
                         Always.
                                     
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         (smiling)
                                     
                         That's fine. I guess maybe I am.
                                     
                         (seriously)
                                     
                         Now tell me something, Jane. Who else 
                         in Mandrake Falls is pixilated?
                                      
                         Jane turns to her sister and this time 
                         they go into a prolonged huddle. It 
                         is apparently a difficult thing to figure 
                         out. Finally they come out of it.
 
                                                              
                         JANE
                                     
                         Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in 
                         pixilated - except us.
                                      
                         AMY
                                     
                         Uh-huh.
                                     
                         349. MED. SHOT OF SPECTATORS
                                     
                         There is an outburst of laughter which 
                         the Judge quickly quells with his gavel.
 
                                                              
                         ? 460 ?

                         Now, just one more question. Do you 
                         see the Judge here? He's a nice man, 
                         isn't he?
                                      
                         JANE & AMY
                                     
                         Uh-huh.

                         Do you think he's pixilated?
                                     
                         JANE
                                     
                         (quickly)
                                     
                         Oh, yes.
                                     
                         AMY
                                     
                         Yes, indeedy.
                                     
                         There is more laughter. More pounding 
                         of the judiciary gavel.

                         Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon 
                         a most important thing. This rather 
                         fantastic idea of yours to want to give 
                         away your entire fortune. It is, to 
                         say the least, most uncommon.

                         Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your 
                         Honor.
                                      
                         CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT, featuring 
                         Longfellow and Judge, as former continues:

                         Suppose you were living in a small town 
                         and getting along fine, and suddenly 
                         somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your 
                         lap. Supposing you discovered that all 
                         that money was messing up your life, 
                         was bringing a lot of vultures around 
                         your neck, and making you lose faith 
                         in everybody. You'd be a little worried, 
                         wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had 
                         a hot potato in your hand, and you'd 
                         want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler 
                         would say you were riding on

                         those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted 
                         to drop something that was burning your 
                         fingers.

                         Cedar springs to his feet.

                         If this man is permitted to carry out 
                         his plan, repercussions will be felt 
                         that will rock the foundations of our 
                         entire governmental system!

                         Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's 
                         raving about. From what I can see, no 
                         matter what system of government we 
                         have, there will always be leaders and 
                         always be followers.

                         Farmers in audience, as Longfellow's 
                         voice continues:
                                      
                         LONGFELLOW'S VOICE
                                     
                         It's like the road out in front of my 
                         house. It's on a steep hill. Every day 
                         I watch the cars climbing up. Some go 
                         lickety-split up that hill on high

                         some have to shift into second - and 
                         some sputter and shake and slip back 
                         to the bottom again. Same cars - same 
                         gasoline - yet some make it and some 
                         don't. And I say the fellows who can 
                         make the hill on high should stop once 
                         in a while and help those who can't.

                         That's all I'm trying to do with this 
                         money. Help the fellows who can't make 
                         the hill on high.

                         What does Mr. Cedar expect me to do 
                         with it? Give it to him - and a lot 
                         of other people who don't need it?

                         If you don't mind, Your Honor, I'll 
                         ride on those top waves for a minute.

                         See all those fellows? They're the ones 
                         I'm trying to help. They need it!

                         Mr. Cedar and that Mr. Semple don't 
                         need anything. They've got plenty! It's 
                         like I'm out in a big boat and I see 
                         one fellow in a rowboat who's tired 
                         of rowing and wants a free ride - and 
                         another fellow who's drowning. Who would 
                         you expect me to rescue? Mr. Cedar, 
                         who just got tired of rowing and wants 
                         a free ride? Or those men out there 
                         who are drowning? Any ten-year-old child 
                         will give you the answer to that.
 
                                                              
                         (to farmers etc. in courtroom)
                                     
                         All right, fellows. Thank you. Sit down.
 
                                                              
                         362. MEDIUM SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM
 
                                                              
                         LONGFELLOW
                                     
                         Now, my plan is very simple. I was going 
                         to give each family ten acres - a horse, 
                         a cow and some seed. And if they work 
                         the farm for three years, it's theirs. 
                         Now, if that's crazy, maybe I ought 
                         to be sent to an institution. But I 
                         don't think it is. And what's more, 
                         Mr. Cedar doesn't either.
                                      
                         (vehemently)
                                     
                         Just before the hearing started, he 
                         offered to call the whole thing off 
                         if I made a settlement with him. So 
                         you see, he wouldn't think I was crazy 
                         if he got paid off.

                         He jumps to his feet, highly incensed.

                         Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!

                         As he listens to Cedar, watching him 
                         antagonistically.

                         stupid in my life!

                         It's an insult to our intelligence to

                         ravings.

                         Throughout his speech the Judge has 
                         been pounding his gavel. Longfellow 
                         has his eyes levelled off on Cedar.

                         He rises to his feet, takes one step 
                         forward, and clouts Cedar flush on the 
                         jaw. As Cedar falls into the arms of 
                         an associate, pandemonium breaks loose.

                         The Judge pounds his gavel. There are 
                         cries of approval from the spectators.

                         Showing spectators, waiting breathlessly

                         The Judge comes out of the huddle; his 
                         face is very stern.

                         Before the Court announces its decision, 
                         I want to warn all who are here that 
                         the police have orders to arrest anyone 
                         creating a disturbance.

                         All eyes are upon the Judge, who clears 
                         his throat.
                                      
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         (serious mien)
                                     
                         Mr. Deeds, there has been a great deal 
                         of damaging testimony against you. Your 
                         behavior, to say the least, has been 
                         most strange.
                                      
                         An audible gasp is heard from audience. 
                         Judge goes on:
                                      
                         JUDGE
                                     
                         But in the opinion of the Court, you 
                         are not only sane, but you are the sanest 
                         man that ever walked into this courtroom. 
                         Case dismissed!
                                      
                         The shout that greets this is tumultuous. 
                         The Judge smiles warmly, and clasps 
                         Longfellow's hand. Immediately, Longfellow 
                         is surrounded by a crowd of people who 
                         come running down the aisles.
                                      
                         377. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND GROUP
                                     
                         They sit, stunned, disappointed. Mrs. 
                         Semple turns to her husband and slaps 
                         him.
                                      
                         MRS. SEMPLE
                                     
                         You nose-twitcher!
                                     
                         Budington rises to confront Cedar.
 
                                                              
                         BUDINGTON
                                     
                         Oh, I knew it! I knew it! You, you
 
                                                              
                         Cedar disgustedly pushes him in the 
                         face, aside.

                         She smiles ecstatically, too excited 
                         to move. Suddenly she rises.
                                      
                         379. MEDIUM SHOT
                                     
                         As Babe tries to get to Longfellow, 
                         but finds herself on the fringe of a 
                         jubilant crowd in the center of which 
                         is Longfellow. She tries to break through, 
                         but finds it impossible. Desperately, 
                         she jumps on a chair and tries frantically 
                         to get a glimpse of him. At that moment, 
                         several farmers have lifted Longfellow 
                         on their shoulders.

                         As jubilantly, Longfellow is carried 
                         out on the shoulders of the excited 
                         crowd.

                         As Babe frantically tries to reach Longfellow, 
                         but is jostled aside. The parade envelops 
                         her.

                         The shouting mob is heading for the 
                         door at end of courtroom. Everyone crowds 
                         forward.

                         Babe is left helplessly out.
                                     
                         DISSOLVE TO:

                         Empty - except for the Falkner sisters, 
                         still whispering to each other, and 
                         Babe, sitting helpless and forlorn.

                         Her eyes are filled. Dismally she starts 
                         forward. We hear a rising commotion 
                         from the outside, at this moment.

                         Longfellow running toward camera with 
                         the mob, shouting, back of him. He reaches 
                         courtroom, slams the doors shut behind 
                         him. Babe, attracted by the noise, looks 
                         up. He runs toward her, and swoops her 
                         up in his arms.

                         He's still pixilated.
                                     
                         AMY
                                     
                         He sure is.

                         She kisses him over and over again. 
                         He looks around and over his shoulder 
                         at the mob, a little dazed. Finally, 
                         he notices her effort, and gives her 
                         one passionately back.
                                      
                         All that is heard is the cheering of 
                         the crowd outside and the Columbia music.
 
                                                              
                         FADE OUT.

[Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops
down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands
on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One
grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge
and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him]

Guard [yelling]:  We're under attack!  Light the signal!

[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long
Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with
his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to
light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at
him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron
lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons
one by one]

Guard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you're here.

Shan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect.

[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li
walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. 
He bows, then looks up]

General Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border.

Chi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor
motions for Chi Fu's silence]

General Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your
palace immediately.

Emperor [forcefully]:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu, 

Chi Fu:  Yes, your highness.

Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up
reserves and as many new recruits as possible.

General Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him.

Emperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip
the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat.

[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the
mound of rice]

Mulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her
chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets
down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual.
[A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit-
ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart
boy, can you help me with my chores today?

[Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist.  She ties a stick
onto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face. 
She ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother
begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for
Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door. 
Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse]

[Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's
ancestors]

Fa Zhou:  Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today. 


Little Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain
around the floor]: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark.

[The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the
grain]

Fa Zhou:  Please, PLEASE, help her.

[Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to
get the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the
bone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the
temple]

Mulan [calling out]: Father I brought your--whoop!  [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan. 
The cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of
his cane]

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan:  I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of
her dress and begins to pour the tea]  

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan [hurried]: Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning--

Fa Zhou:  Mulan--

Mulan:  And three at night. 

Fa Zhou:  Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up--

Mulan:  --uphold the family honor.  Don't worry father.  I wont let you down. 
[Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve]  Wish me luck. 
[Mulan hurries down the stairs]

Fa Zhou [calling out]:  Hurry!  [to himself] I'm going to...pray some more.
[Fa Zhou turns and walks back into the temple]

[Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried]

Bath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? 
The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building]

Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for
luck.

Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be,
they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to
Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. 
Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street]

Fa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No!

[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two
horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other
side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee]

Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of
fright]

Fa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai.

[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and
jumps off with hay stuck in her hair]

Mulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had
to--

Fa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk
together into the preparation area]

[Song: Honor to us all]

Bath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the
Bath]
This is what you give me 
to work with?
Well, honey, I've seen worse.
We're gonna turn 
this sow's ear
Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in
the bath] 

Mulan [spoken]:  It's freezing.

Fa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time.  

Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]:
We'll have you
Washed and dried
Primped and polished 
till you glow with pride
Trust my recipe for 
instant bride
You'll bring honor to us all

Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She
notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this?

Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes,
in case I forget something?

Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll
need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment]

[Cut to the hair dressers]

Hair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin]:
Wait and see
When we're through

Hair Dresser 2:
Boys will gladly go to 
war for you

Hair Dresser 1:
With good fortune 

Hair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]:
And a great hairdo

Both:
You'll bring honor to us all

Fa Li and others:  [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and
pauses to make an impressive move.  Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa
Li comes back and drags Mulan away]
A girl can bring her family
Great honor in one way
By striking a good match
And this could be the day

Dresser 1 [Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan]:
Men want girls 
with good taste

Dresser 2:
Calm

Fa Li:
Obedient

Dresser 1:
Who work fast-paced

Fa Li:
With good breeding

Dresser 2 [Pulling the dress tight around her waist]:
And a tiny waist 

Mulan [expressing her waist being squeezed tight] [spoken]: huh.

All Three:
You'll bring honor to us all 

Chorus:  [Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan
grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner]
We all must serve 
our Emperor
Who guards us from the Huns
A man by bearing arms
A girl by bearing sons 

Make-up Lady/Fa Li: [Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye liner]
[in a 3 person round]
 When we're through 
you can't fail
Like a lotus blossom 
soft and pale
How could any fellow 
say "No sale"
You'll bring honor to us all
[Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her reflection.  Not looking
pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her
forehead and smiles]

Fa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair]:  There, you're
ready.

Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in
Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her
sash] [sings]

Beads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck]
You must proudly show it [Grandma Fa raises her chin high with her hand]
Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's
sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased]
And even you can't blow it

Mulan:  [Walking to catch up with the other maidens]
Ancestors
Hear my plea
Help me not to make a fool of me
And to not uproot my fam'ly tree
Keep my father standing tall

Maidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall
in line with the other 4 maidens]
Scarier than the undertaker
We are meeting our 
matchmaker

All Townspeople:
Destiny
Guard our girls
And our future 
as it fast unfurls
Please look kindly on 
these cultured pearls
Each a perfect porcelain doll

Maiden #1:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #2:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #3:  Please bring honor to us
Maiden #4:  Please bring honor to us
Mulan and Maidens:  Please bring honor to us all! 

[All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their
parasols.  End of song]

Matchmaker [looking at her clipboard]:  Fa Mulan

Mulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]:  Present.

Matchmaker:  Speaking without permission.

Mulan:  Oops. 

Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  Who spit in her bean curd?

[Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following
behind and closing the door]

Matchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from
his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. 
[Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her]
Recite the final admonition.

Mulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as
she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu

Matchmaker:  Well...

Mulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her
arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised,
Mulan looks at her arm again] act.  [now rapidly] This shall bring you honor
and glory.  [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief] Huh.

Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes
not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker
grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and
leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a
teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a
sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at
Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours
the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan
notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup]

Mulan [quiet and timid]:  Um, pardon me.

Matchmaker:  And silent! [Matchmaker sniffs the tea]

Mulan [reaching and grabbing the teacup]:  Could I just take that back...one
moment.

[They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee
jumps down matchmaker's dress]

Matchmaker:  Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances
around]  Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and
sits down on the coals.  Matchmaker jumps around screaming]  Ahhhhhhhhhhh 
[Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind
causing it to flame up.  Mulan looks surprised about her mistake]

[Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming
from Matchmaker's building]

Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  I think it's going well, don't you?

Matchmaker [running out of the building screaming]:  Put it out! Put it out! 
Put it out! [Mulan takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out
the fire.  She bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face
as she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa] [with anger]  You are a disgrace! 
[Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to pieces]  You may look like a
bride, but you will never bring your family honor!

[The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away]

[Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan.  She looks
sorrowful.  Fa Zhou sees his daughter and smiles.  Mulan sees her father's
smile.  She covers her face with Khan's head and leads him to the water
trough]

[Song: Reflection]

Mulan: 
Look at me [looking at her reflection in the water trough]
I will never pass for 
a perfect bride [taking off her earrings and beads of jade]
Or a perfect daughter [Mulan watches Fa Li relating what happened at the
Matchmaker's to Fa Zhou]
Can it be
I'm not meant to play 
this part?  [Mulan releases Cri-Kee back to the wild]
Now I see
That if I were to truly
To be myself [Mulan hops along the bridge railing]
I would break my 
family's heart

Who is that girl I see  [Mulan looks into the pond and sees her own
reflection]
Staring straight
Back at me? [Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward
the temple]
Why is my reflection someone 
I don't know? [Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily pad]
Somehow I cannot hide [Mulan walking into the family temple]
Who I am [Cri-Kee watches Mulan in the temple seeing multiple reflections of
herself in the ancestors' stones]
Though I've tried  [Mulan bows to the ancestors]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside?  [Mulan finishes wiping off her make-up seeing her reflection
in the stones]
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside? [Mulan gets up and heads out the temple]

[End of song.  Mulan sits on a bench under the blossom tree.  Fa Zhou
approaches her, clearing his throat.  Mulan sees him approaching and turns her
head away.  Fa Zhou sits down beside Mulan]

Fa Zhou:  My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into
the blossom tree].  But look, this one's late.  But, I'll bet that when it
blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.  [Mulan and Fa Zhou share
smiles.  Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards
on horseback]

Mulan:  What is it?

[Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan
following]

Fa Li:  Mulan, stay inside.

[Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. 
Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof]

Chi Fu:  Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the
Huns have invaded China! 

Townspeople [expressing surprise]:  No!

Chi Fu:  By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the
Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard
and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family.

Yi's Son [holding his old father back]:  I will serve the Emperor in my
father's place.

Chi Fu:  The Fa Family.

Mulan:  No.

[Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before
the horsemen]

Fa Zhou [standing proud]:  I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches
for the conscription notice]

Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription
notice]:  Father, you can't go.

Fa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]:  Mulan!

Mulan:  Please sir, my father has already fought bravely--

Chi Fu:  Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue
in a man's presence.

Fa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]:  Mulan, you dishonor me.

[Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away]

Chi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]:  Report tomorrow at the Wu
Shu camp.

Fa Zhou:  Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take
his cane from Fa Li]

Chi Fu [fading out as we follow Fa Zhou]:  The Chu family.  The Wen family. 
The Chang family.  The...

[Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night.  Fa Zhou takes out his sword and
practices his stances.  Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts
up and he falls.  Unbeknownst to her father, Mulan watches in horror.  She
breathes heavily]

[Cut to dinner.  The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence. 
Thunder can be heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window. 
Mulan pours the tea for her family.  She slams her teacup down on the table
and stands up]

Mulan:  You shouldn't have to go.

Fa Li:  Mulan!

Mulan:  There are plenty of young men to fight for China.

Fa Zhou:  It is an honor to protect my country and my family.

Mulan [angrily]:  So you'll die for honor!

Fa Zhou [standing up and angered]:  I will DIE doing what's right.

Mulan [starts to speak but is cut off]: But if you--

Fa Zhou:  I know my place, it is time you learned yours.

[Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs
outside into the rain storm and cries]

[Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain. 
Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She
watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks
out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa
Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights
incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to
her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and
hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and
takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave
to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries
out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor. 
Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her
head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes
the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the
stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes
forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out
of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes
one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the
gate and off to camp.]

[Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.  Cut to
Grandma Fa.  She wakes up with a start rising in bed.  Cut to Grandma Fa
walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's bedroom, both are in bed]

Grandma Fa:  Mulan is gone.

Fa Zhou [waking up]:  What?  It can't be.  [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand
and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the
cabinet and sees his armor is gone.  He hurries outside] [calling out]  Mulan! 
[He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury] No.

Fa Li [kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou]:  You must go after her.  She
could be killed!

Fa Zhou [sadly]:  If I reveal her, she will be. [Fa Zhou embraces Fa Li]

Grandma Fa:  Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan.

[Cut to the Fa Family Temple.  A wind blows out the incense at the base of the
center stone.  The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to
life]

First Ancestor [motioning to a bronze dragon]:  Mushu, awaken!

[Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being
obscured by smoke]

Mushu [rising from the smoke arms stretched out]:  I live!  So tell me what
mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor.  You just say the word and I'm
there.

First Ancestor [agitated]:  Mushu!

Mushu:  Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten
our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr.

First Ancestor [sternly to silence Mushu]:  Mushu!  These are the family
guardians [motioning towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling]. 
They...

Mushu [dejectedly]:  Protect the family.

First Ancestor [pointing to the empty pedestal]:  And you, oh demoted one.

Mushu:  I...ring the gong.

First Ancestor:  That's right, now, wake up the ancestors.

Mushu:  One family reunion coming right up.  [ringing the gong] Okay people,
people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine. 
You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me!

Ancestor 1:  I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the
start.

Ancestor 3:  Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family.

Ancestor 2:  She's just trying to help her father.

Ancestor 4 [appearing out of thin air]:  But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou
will be forever shamed.  Dishonor will come to the family.  Traditional values
will disintegrate.

Ancestor 5:  Not to mention they'll lose the farm.

Ancestor 1:  My children never caused such trouble.  They all became
acupuncturists.

Ancestor 3:  Well, We can't all be acupuncturists.

Ancestor 6:  No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser!

[All ancestors argue at once, except First Ancestor]

Ancestor 7:  Let a guardian bring her back.  

Ancestor 8 [grabbing Mushu and bringing him next to a guardian]: Yeah, awaken
the most cunning.

Ancestor 4 [taking Mushu and holding him next to the stone rabbit guardian]: 
No, the swiftest.

Ancestor 9 [grabbing Mushu and holding him next to the stone monkey guardian]: 
No, send the wisest.

First Ancestor:  Silence!  We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to
the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window]

Mushu [climbs up the empty guardian post laughing]:  Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay,
okay, I get the drift, I'll go. [All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise
and laugh uncontrollably]  You all don't think I can do it.  Watch this here. 
[Mushu produces a small flame from his mouth]  Ah, ha, Jump back, I'm pretty
hot huh.  Don't make me have to singe nobody to prove no point.

First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling away from the post]:  You had your
chance to protect the Fa family.

Ancestor 6:  Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster.

Fa Deng [with his decapitated head on his lap]:  Yeah, thanks a lot.

Mushu:  And your point is?

First Ancestor:  The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve
Mulan.

Mushu:  What?  But I'm a real dragon.

First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as
Mushu fights to hold on]:  You are not worthy of this spot.  Now, awaken the
Great Stone Dragon.  [First Ancestor throws Mushu out of the temple]

Mushu [looking back into the temple]:  So you'll get back to me on the job
thing.

[An ancestor throws Mushu's gong and hits Mushu in the face]

Mushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]:  Just one
chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya.

Mushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]:  Yo rocky, wake
up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over
to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong
stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the
Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear
with the gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard
against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon
crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's
head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me!

First Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]:  Great Stone Dragon,
have you awaken? 

Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor
can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I
am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning [Mushu waves].  I will go forth and
fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon?

First Ancestor:  Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws.

Mushu:  Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down
the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the
dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him]

Mushu [muffled]:  Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. 
[Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And
all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road.

[Cri-Kee enters stage right]

Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp.

Mushu:  Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone
Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the
temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be
begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and
done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right]

Cri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]:  Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp.

Mushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]:  Hey, what makes you think you're coming?

Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. 

Mushu:  You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you?

Cri-Kee:  Chirp. Chirp.

Mushu:  Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and
throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you?

[Interlude]

[Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. 
He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair
Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts
before the rest of the army]

Hun Long-Hair Guy:  Imperial scouts. 

[Shan Yu dismounts and walks towards the scouts]

Scout #1:  Shan-Yu.

[He crouches down in front of them]

Shan-Yu [adjusting Scout #1's collar]:  Nice work, gentlemen.  You found the
Hun army. [motioning to the soldiers on horseback.  The Hun army laughs]

Scout #2:  The Emperor will stop you.

Shan-Yu [grabs Scout #2 by the shirt collar and lifts him up to his face]: 
Stop me?  He invited me.  By building his wall, he challenged my strength. 
Well I'm here to play his game  [Shan-Yu throws Scout #2 to the ground and
points his sword at Scout #1 as he gets up and runs] [calling out to the
scouts] Go!  Tell your emperor to send his strongest armies.  [Quietly]  I'm
ready. 

[The Imperial Scouts run off towards the palace]

Shan-Yu [scratching his chin]:  How many men does it take to deliver a
message.

Archer Guy [drawing back his bow]:  One.

[End Interlude]

[Cut to Mulan on a hill outside of the camp.  Khan is sitting watching]

Mulan:  Okay, okay, how 'bout this?  Ahem, [in her manly voice] excuse me,
where do I sign in?  Hah, I see you have a sword.  I have one too.  They're
very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword
out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground.  Khan rolls on his back in
laughter.  Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting
Khan].  I'm working on it.  Who am I fooling?  It's going to take a miracle to
get me into the army.

[Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either
side.  Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight]

Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]:  Did I hear someone ask for a
miracle!?  Let me hear you say aye!

Mulan [Running and hiding behind a rock]:  Ahhhhhh.

Mushu:  That's close enough.

Mulan [from behind a rock]:  Ghost.

Mushu:  Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.  For I have
been sent by your ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a
dragon on the rock and stamps him down with his foot] to guide you through
your masquerade.  [bending down to Cri-Kee]  C'mon, you're gonna stay you're
gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out
that you are a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the
rocks]

Mulan:  Who are you?

Mushu:  Who am I?  Who am I?  I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles
big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the
pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real
size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan
pushes Khan back]

Mulan:  Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me?

Mushu:  Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips
out his tongue to show Mulan what he means].

Mulan:  You're uh...

Mushu:  Intimidating?  Awe inspiring?

Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny.

Mushu [with a look of disappointment]:  Of course.  I'm travel size for your
convenience.  If I was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose]
would die of fright.  [Khan tries to bite Mushu]  [pointing to the ground
speaking to Khan] Down Bessy.  My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. 
For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can see
straight through your armor.  [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and
slaps Mushu with the right]  Ow.  [angrily] All right, that's it!  Dishonor! 
Dishonor on your whole family.  [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note of this
[Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing].  [Loudly with gusto]
Dishonor on you.  Dishonor on your cow.  Dis-

Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]:  Stop!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry
[kneeling down in front of Mushu].  I'm just nervous.  I've never done this
before.

Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me.  And don't you slap me no more, we
clear on that?  [Mulan nods emphatically].  All right.  Okey dokey, let's get
this show on the road.  Cri-Kee, get the bags [Mushu starts walking to the
camp].  [to Khan] Let's move it heifer.

[Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance]

Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]:  Okay this
is it, time to show 'em your man walk.  Shoulders back,  chest high, feet
apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back]  ...and strut 2, 3, break it
down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the attention the
men who see her.  Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and
another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful
isn't it?

Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]:  They're disgusting.

Mushu:  No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so
pay attention.

[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier]

Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]:  Look, this
tattoo will protect me from harm.

[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing
Ling to laugh.  Mulan watches in utter amazement.  Yao kisses his hand]

Ling [laughing]:  I hope you can get your money back.

Mulan:  I don't think I can do this.

Mushu:  It's all attitude.  Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao].

[Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits]

Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]:  What are you looking at?

Mushu:  Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.'

[Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder.  The
force causes Yao to run into Chien-Po]

Chien-Po:  Oh Yao, you made a friend.

Mushu:  Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that.

[Mulan slaps Yao on the behind]

Yao:  Wu hoo hooooo.  [grabbing Mulan buy the collar]  I'm going to hit you so
hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy.

Chien-Po [Holding and picking up Yao]:  Yao, relax and chant with me. 
Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa.
 Yao:  Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da.

Chien-Po:  Feel better? 

Yao [relaxed]:  Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground]  [to Mulan
while walking away] Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy.

Mushu [loudly]:  Chicken boy!?  Say that to my face ya limp noodle!

[Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch.  Mulan ducks as
Yao hits Ling standing behind her]

Yao:  Oh, sorry Ling.  Hey!

[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump
attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po]

Ling:  You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes.

[Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a
soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line
of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who
has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew]

Mulan:  Hey guys.  

[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent.  General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.]

General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]:  The Huns have struck here, here and here.  I will take the main troops up to
the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village.

Chi Fu:  Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha.

General Li:  You will stay here and train the new recruits.  When Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands
a sword to Shang]

Shang:  Captain?

Chi Fu:  Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General.  Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience--

General Li:  Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressive
military lineage.  I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job.

Shang [excitedly]:  Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir.

General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]:  Very good then.  We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City.  [to Chi Fu] I'll
expect a full report in three weeks.

Chi Fu [to Shang]:  And I wont leave anything out.  [exits through the tent]

Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]:  Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time. 
Heh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit
sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse]

Chi Fu:  Most impressive.

General Li:  Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp]

Shang [quietly, to himself]:  Good luck, Father.  [Shang looks at his troops and sighs]

Chi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]:  Day one.

Shang [shouting]:  Soldiers!

All Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her.  Mulan is crouching in the fetal position on the ground]:  He started it!

[Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her.  Mulan looks up, sees Shang over top of her and gets up quickly dusting herself off]

Shang [to Mulan]:  I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp!

Mulan:  Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.  [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder]  You know how it is
when you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cook
outdoors.

Shang:  What's your name?

Mulan [stumbling]:  Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh--

Chi Fu [stepping into Mulan's face]:  Your commanding officer just asked you a question.

Mulan:  Uhh, I've got a name.  Huh.  And it's a boys name too.

Mushu [from the back of Mulan]:  Ling, How 'bout Ling?

Mulan [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]:  His name's Ling.

Shang:  I didn't ask for his name.  I asked for yours.

Mushu:  Try, uh, ahh, Chu!

Mulan:  Ah Chu.

Shang:  Ah Chu?

Mushu:  Gesundheit.  He He, I kill myself.

Mulan [whispering over her shoulder]:  Mushu.

Shang:  Mushu?

Mulan:  No.

Shang:  Then what is it!

Mushu:  Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up!

Mulan:  It's Ping.

Shang:  Ping.

Mushu:  Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth together]

Mulan:  Yes, my name is Ping.

Shang:  Let me see your conscription notice.  [Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou?

Chi Fu:  I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son.

Mulan:  Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The
recruits laugh]

Chi Fu:  I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic.

Shang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And
tomorrow, the real work begins.

[All recruits growl at Mulan]

Mushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]:  You know, we have to work on your people skills.

[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent.  Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings.  Cri-Kee rings like an alarm clock]

Mushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup,
hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on. 
Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see
you.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey,
get outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge]

Mulan:  Am I late?

Mushu [while feeding Mulan]:  No time to talk.  Now remember, it's your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play
nice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt.

Mulan [with her mouth full of food]:  But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt.

Mushu:  Don't talk with your mouth full.  Now let's see your war face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food]. 
I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C'mon scare me, girl! 

Mulan [swallows the food]:  Rrrrrrr!

Mushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]:  Oh, that's my tough looking warrior.  That's what I'm talking about.  Now get out
there and make me proud. [Mushu ties up Mulan's hair]

[Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent]

Mushu:  What do you mean the troops just left?  

Mulan [acting surprised]:  They what!? [Mulan hurriedly puts on her clothes and jumps out of the tent going off to join the other recruits]  

Mushu [running out from the tent calling after Mulan]:  Wait, you forgot your sword.  My little baby off to destroy people [sniffle].

[Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang's tent]

Chi Fu [enters stage left]:  Order people, order!

Recruit #2:  I'd like a pan fried noodle.

Chien-Po:  Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin to laugh]

Recruit #3:  Moo goo gai pan

Chi Fu:  That's not funny.

[Mulan comes running up to the group]

Ling [noticing Mulan's arrival]:  Looks like our new friend slept in this morning.  [Mulan stops between Ling and Yao] [to Ping] Hellooo Ping,
Are you hungry?

Yao:  Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with
her hands.  Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything]

All Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]:  Yeah.

Shang [loudly]:  Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly
impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who
acts otherwise will answer to me.

Yao:  Ooooo, tough guy.

Shang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]:  Yao.  [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang
Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow.

Yao [bows to Shang]:  I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.  [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole]

Shang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it
high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's
arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while
Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow.

[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her
behind as she walks away in front of Shang]

Shang:  We've got a long way to go.

[Song I'll Make a Man Out of You]

[Shang throws staffs to the soldiers.  Yao intercepts Mulan's staff and trips her with it]

Shang:
Let's get down to business--
to defeat the Huns.

[Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff.  The troops are highly impressed]

Recruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]:  Hua

Shang:
Did they send me daughters
 when I asked for sons?  [Ling puts a cricket down Mulan's back causing her to flail erratically]
You're the saddest bunch
 I ever met  [Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves uncontrollably]
But you can bet 
before we're through  [Shang does a somersault in the air landing near Mulan.  He takes a pole in the stomach.  Shang stops Mulan and
takes her staff.  He grabs her by the collar]
Mister, I'll make a man
 out of you 

[Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow]
Tranquil as a forest
[The recruits try and fail.  Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a target on her arrow before she shoots.  Mulan looks at Mushu's in
shock and pauses.  Shang looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile]
But on fire within
[Shang balances a bucket of water on his head holding a staff.  The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the staff]
Once you find your center
You are sure to win
[Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on her head.  As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head]
You're a spineless, pale,
pathetic lot 
And you haven't got a clue 
[Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot.  Mushu
comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan]
Somehow I'll make a man
out of you!

Chien-Po [running through a field of fire arrows]:
I'm never gonna catch 
my breath

Yao [following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with an arrow]:
Say good-bye to those 
who knew me

Ling [Banging his head on a stone slab]:
Boy I was a fool in school 
for cutting gym

[Shang practices martial arts with Mulan.  With a punch to the face he knocks her back into a tree]

Mushu [from the tree acts as a boxing coach]:
This guy's got 'em 
scared to death

Mulan [Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring]:
Hope he doesn't see 
right through me

Chien-Po [stops as he's hopping across poles protruding from water causing Shang and the recruits to pile into him]:
Now I really wish that I 
knew how to swim!

Shang and Chorus:  
[Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open field. Ling kicks the support structure out from Mulan's cannon and it begins to fall.
Mulan quickly grabs the cannon and it fires high and back towards the camp landing and exploding Chi Fu's tent]
(Be a man)
We must be swift as 
the coursing river
(Be a man)
With all the force 
of a great typhoon
(Be a man)
With all the strength 
of a raging fire
[Picture of Shang looking over the camp from the hill not looking pleased]
Mysterious as the 
dark side of the moon 

Shang [his troops laden with poles on their shoulders carrying bags of grain - one on each side.  They march up a mountain]:
Time is racing toward us 
till the Huns arrive  
[Chi Fu points Shang's eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the ground.  Cri-Kee and Mushu try to pick her up but hide when Shang
comes up to her.  Shang picks up her pole with grain, puts it on top of his and returns to the troops. Mulan looks rejected]
Heed my every order 
and you might survive
[Shang hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan]
You're unsuited for 
the rage of war
So pack up, go home, 
you're through
How could I make a man
out of you?

Shang and Chorus [Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb the pole again]:
(Be a man)
We must be swift as 
the coursing river
[Mulan ties the weights together behind the pole and uses the cloth to help her shimmy up the pole]
(Be a man)
With all the force 
of a great typhoon
[As the sun begins to rise the recruits come out of their tents to cheer on Mulan]
(Be a man)
With all the strength 
of a raging fire
[As Shang comes out of his tent, the arrow he shot up onto the pole comes down to his feet.  He looks up and sees Mulan sitting on top of
the pole]
Mysterious as the 
dark side of the moon

[order of events during the last repeat of the chorus:
Troops hit all targets with arrows correctly.

[End Song]

[Interlude]

[Cut to Shan Yu sitting on top of a tree.  He cuts off the very top with his sword.  His falcon swoops buy and drops a doll.  Shan-Yu takes
the doll, sniffs it, looks surprised, and drops down to the ground]

Shan-Yu [tossing the doll to Hun Strong Man]:  What do you see?

Hun Strong Man [feeling the doll]:  Black pine, from the high mountains.  [Long Hair Hun Man takes the doll from Hun Strong Man.  Bald
Hun Man #1 takes a hair as it passes by him]

Bald Hun Man #1:  White horse hair.  Imperial stallions.  

Long Hair Hun Man [sniffing the doll]:  Sulfur, from cannons.

Shan-Yu:  This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the Imperial Army's waiting for us.

Hun Archer:  We can avoid them easily.

Shan-Yu [shaking his head]:  No, the quickest way to the Emperor is through that pass.  Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll.  We
should return it to her.

[End Interlude]

[Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee]

Mushu:  Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you?

Mulan [from behind the reeds]:  Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one.  

Mushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]:  So a couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky.  Well myself I
kinda like that corn chip's smell.

Mulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu]:  Ahhhhhhh.

Mushu:   Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan
keeping his eyes covered].

Mulan:   Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch.

Mushu:  Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid
girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene.

Cri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]:  Chirp, Chirp.

Yao:  Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers]

Mushu [gasps]:  Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice!

[Yao and Ling jump into the water.  Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave.  Yao and Ling ride
the wave towards Mulan.  Mulan sees them and hides her face behind a lily pad]

Yao [calling]:  Hey, Ping.

[Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest]

Mulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]:  Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share
"this boy is strange" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go.  Bye, bye.  [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front
facing the rock]

Ling [from behind Mulan]:  Come back here.  I know we were jerks to you before so lets start over.  [extending his hand to shake hands with
Mulan]  Hi, I'm Ling!

Mulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an outstretched right arm, smiling]:  Heh, heh.  [Mulan turns
and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po]

Chien-Po [taking a lily pad off his head]:  And I'm Chien-Po.

Mulan [waving slightly and smiling]:  Hello Chien-Po.

[Yao stands on top of a rock looking down at the others.  Mulan looks down into the water and hides her eyes with her free hand]

Yao:  And I am Yao, king of the rock.  And there's nothin' you girls can do about it.

Ling [taking a fighting stance]:  Oh, yeah?  Well, I think Ping [elbowing Mulan] and I could take you.

Mulan [wading away]:  I really don't want to take him anywhere.

Ling [following Mulan]:  Ping, we have to fight!

Mulan:  No we don't. [unnaturally]  We could just close our eyes and swim around.

Ling: C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch!  Something bit me.

Mushu [popping out of the water between Mulan and Ling]:  What a nasty flavor.

Ling [with fear and gusto]:  Snake!  

Chien-Po [while all three of them climb up the rock and on each other]: Snake, snake.

[Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore.  Khan comes close enough to shore and Mulan hides behind Khan as she wraps a towel
around her body]

[Cut to Yao, Ling and Chien-Po calmed down sitting on the rock]

Ling:  Some king of the rock!  [Yao pushes him off the rock]

[Cut to Mulan with towel wrapped around her]

Mulan:  Boy, that was close.

Mushu [brushing his teeth]:  No, that was vile!  You owe me big!

Mulan:  I never want to see a naked man again.  [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump into the lake]

Mushu:  Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts.

[Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully.  Chi Fu and Shang are talking from inside]

Chi Fu [fading in]:  You think your troops are ready to fight?  Hah!  They would not last a minute against the Huns.  

Shang:  They completed their training.

Chi Fu:  Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never
see battle.

Mushu [from outside the tent]:  Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war. [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing with my
plan.

Shang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]:  We're not finished.

Chi Fu [pulling the board away]:  Be careful, Captain.  The General may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council.  And, oh, by the
way, huh, I got that job on my own.  [opens the entrance to the tent for Shang] You're dismissed.

[Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan]

Mulan [in a manly voice]:  Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh...  [Shang walks by without reacting] or not.  [calling out to Shang] 
For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.  [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward]

Mushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]:  I saw that!

Mulan [innocently]:  What?

Mushu [teasing]:  You like him don't you?

Mulan:  No, I--

Mushu:  Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,  [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to
Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands [rubbing hands together].

[Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big
showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He
finishes and Mushu takes the paper]

Mushu:  Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot
if you'd come and back us up.  [sarcastically]  That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't
mind bringing up some."  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts
writing the note again]  That's better, much better.  [taking the note] Okay, Let's go.

[Cut to Khan drinking water from the trough.  Mushu is on his back]

Mushu:  Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride.  [Khan squirts Mushu off his back with water from his mouth]

[Cut to Chi Fu walking out of the lake wrapped in a towel, sounds of laughter can be heart from the troops]

Chi Fu [muttering]:  Insubordinate ruffians.  [then calling to the troops]  You men owe me a new pair of slippers.  And I do not squeal like a
girl.  [a panda bear chomps down on the slipper Chi Fu is holding] Aaaaaahhhhhh!

Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the note
towards Chi Fu.  Cri-Kee works the mouth]:  Urgent news from the general!  [Chi Fu looks over the panda]  What's the matter, you've never
seen a 'black and white' before?

Chi Fu:  Who are you?

Mushu:  Excuse me!  I think the question is: who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your
hat for that, [the panda starts walking forward] snatch it right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper
half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message].  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on
before I report you.  [the panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight]

Chi Fu [looking around for Mushu but not finding him, then runs into Shang's tent]:  Captain.  Urgent news from the General.  We're needed
at the front.

Mushu [from up in the tree]:  Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' out.  [Cri-Kee high fives Mushu]

[Song:  A Girl Worth Fighting For]

Army Chorus [troops walking up hill]:
For a long time we've been 
marching off to battle

Yao [close-up of Yao, then a shot of 2 cows]: 
In a thundering herd 
we feel a lot like cattle

Cow [spoken]:  Moo

Army Chorus [showing troops marching]:
Like the pounding beat 
our aching feet aren't 
easy to ignore

Ling [catching up to Yao and Chien-Po]:
Hey, think of instead,
A girl worth fighting for [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look upwards dreamily]

Mulan [spoken from behind]: Huh?

Ling [grabbing Mulan and drawing her close while pulling out a centerfold]:
That's what I said, a girl 
worth fighting for [Mulan runs away seeing the centerfold]

[artistry section where the images are drawn like painted people.  Ling is seen looking at a woman and then kissing her]
I want her paler than the 
moon with eyes that 
shine like stars

Yao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through]:
My girl will marvel at 
my strength, adore my 
battle scars

Chien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl of rice as a cow, pig and chicken fall beside them]:
I couldn't care less what she'll 
wear or what she looks like
It all depends on what 
she cooks like:
Beef, pork, chicken... [end painted people section, the last image fades into statues that the troops just passed]

All Three:
Mmm...

Yao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over their heads.  Mulan looks disgusted and hurries forward]:
Bet the local girls thought 
you were quite the charmer

Ling [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]:
And I'll bet the ladies love 
a man in armor [the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self]

Army Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of the carriage holding cannons.  Cri-Kee looks shocked.  The
ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]:
You can guess what we 
have missed the most 
since we went off 
to war
What do we want?
A girl worth fighting for!

Yao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]:
My girl will think I have 
no faults

Chien-Po:
That I'm a major find

Mulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily waiting for her ideal woman.  She is forced to speak (sing)]:
[spoken] Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's 
got a brain,  [Yao starts to look unimpressed]
Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs her shoulders]

Ling, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and disgusted]: Nah!

Ling [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and shakes her head disapprovingly.  Ling leans against the
carriage of cannons]:
My manly ways and turns of 
phrase are sure to thrill her

Yao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling.  Ling looks upset then falls in the mud]:
He thinks he's such a 
lady-killer!

Chi Fu:
I've a girl back home who's 
unlike any other.

Yao [aside to Mulan]:
Yeah, the only girl who'd 
love him is his mother! [Mulan smiles]

Army Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders with Mulan in the middle to her discontent]:
But when we come home 
in victory they'll line up 
at the door!

Ling [sitting on top of Chien-Po]:
What do we want?

Army Chorus:
A girl worth fighting for!

Ling:
Wish that I had

Army Chorus [Mulan breaks away and walks in the opposite direction of the army]:
A girl worth fighting for!
(whistle) [Mulan sees Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po with snowballs about to pelt her so she turns around] 
A girl worth fighting--

[All have stunned looks on their faces]

[End Song]

[Cut to ruins of a burned out village.  The soldiers walk through the singed gate and look around at the few planks that remain from the
buildings]

Shang [from mounted horse]:  Search for survivors.

[Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village.  She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully.  Shang
comes to her side]

Shang:  I don't understand.  My father should have been here.

Chi Fu [calling out from the top of a hill overlooking a valley]:  Captain!  

[Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen.  Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying face
down, broken cannon carts.  Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley.  Chien-Po
walks up from the valley carrying a helmet]

Chien-po [handing the helmet to Shang]:  ...the General.

[Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill.  He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright.  He kneels down and
places the helmet on top of the sword.  Mulan approaches him from behind]

Mulan [softly]:  I'm sorry.

[Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by.  Shang walks to the center of the troops. He grabs his
horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse]

Shang:  The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the
Emperor now.  Move out!

[Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword.  She turns around and joins the rest of
the troops marching on]

[Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The
troops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu
points at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind]

Shang [angrily]:  What happened?!

Mulan [stumbling]:  Uhhh--

Shang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the
arrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!!

[The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows
start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire]

Shang:  Save the cannons!

[The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him
from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan
free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet
and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan.

Mushu:  Oh sure, save the horse.

[Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao,
Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them]

Shang:  Fire!

[They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides]

Shang:  Fire!

[Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming
from the mountain position]

Shang:  Hold the last cannon.  [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.  Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare
to fight.  If we die, we die with honor.

[Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on
Shan-Yu's war cry  The Hun army follows]

Shang:  Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu.

[The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow
embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward]

Yao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]:  Hey.
 Shang:  Ping, come back.  Ping!

[Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the
oncoming horde with worry in his eyes]

Shang [starting to run after her waving his arms]:  Stop!

[Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang]

Mushu [seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position]:  All right, you might want to light that right about now.  Quickly!  Quickly!

[Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock]

Yao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]:  C'mon, we've gotta help.  [they charge towards Mulan's position]

[Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands
on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu]

Mushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]:  You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in
front of you!

[The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and
Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow]

Shan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]:  Yrrrrrrraah.  

[Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu's horse stumbles. 
Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his
horse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him
around and helping him run away from the avalanche]

Yao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]:  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn
around and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa!

[Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up
Shan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She
grabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow]

[Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.  They see the snow approaching close and run to larger shelter where the rest of
Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches their posision]

[Cut to Mushu riding down the snow on a shield]

Mushu [calling out]:  Mulan!  Mulan!  [seeing hair sticking up from the snow] Mulan?  [Mushu picks up the Hun by the hair]

Hun Soldier:  Arrrrr.

Mushu [pushing the hun soldier back under the snow]:  Nope.  Mulan!  [Mushu picks up Cri-Kee out of the snow]  Man, you are one lucky
bug.

[Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche.  Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemerge
quickly.  She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow]

Mulan [calling loudly]:  Shang, Shang!  [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang's position.  She picks him up and places him on Khan.  She
turns Khan around again to be riding upstream]

[Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling]

Chien-Po:  Do you see them?

Yao [extatically]:  Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached]  Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope
completely passed through his hands]--ty.

[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield]

Mushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]:  Hey Mulan, I found a lucky
cricket.

Mulan [speaking loudly]:  We need help!  [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan]

Mushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they're about to fall
over the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We're gonna die!  We're gonna die!  I know we're gonna die!  No way we can
survive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao]

Yao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers
grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff]

Yao:  Pull

[Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu
and Cri-Kee to safety]

Mushu:  I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces]

[The soldiers help them up to the cliff]

Ling:  Step back guys, give 'em some air.

Shang [catching his breath]:  Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust.
[Mulan smiles big]

Ling:  Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all.

Yao [lifting his arm high]:  You're king of the mountain!

Chien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes!

Mulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side]

Shang:  Ping, what's wrong?  [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly] 
He's wounded, get help!  [Ping starts to pass out.  The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness] 
Ping, hold on.  Hold on.

[Cut to outside of the medic tent.  Mulan and Medic are inside.  Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite
concerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and
goes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to
fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is
noticeable]

Mulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh,  I can explain.

Chi Fu [stepping into the tent]:  Huh?  So it's true.

Mulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]:  Shang!

[Cut to outside the tent.  Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm.  Mulan uses her other hand to hold the blanket]

Chi Fu:  I knew there was something wrong with you.  [Chi Fu takes off Mulan's hair tie and throws her to the ground]  A woman.

[Ling, Yao and Chien-Po are shocked]

Chi Fu [to the troops]:  Trecherous snake.

Mulan [on the ground kneeling and hunched over, speaking to Shang]:  My name is Mulan.  I did it to save my father.

Chi Fu [to the troops]:  High treason!

Mulan:  I didn't mean for it to go this far.

Chi Fu [getting in Mulan's face and speaking to her while she whinces]:  Ultimate dishonor.

Mulan:  It was the only way.  Please believe me.

Chi Fu [to Shang]:  Hmph, Captain?

[Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard attached to Khan.  Khan rears back]

Chi Fu [to the soldier by Khan]:  Restrain him.

[Shang walks toward Mulan with sword in hand]

Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]:  Noooooo!

Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]:  You know the law.

[Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws
it down in front of Mulan]

Shang:  A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out!

Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]:  But you can't just...

Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]:  I said, "Move out!"

[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes
his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he
moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick]

Mushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks
up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi.

Mulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home.

Mushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all
your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry].

Mulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror
[picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the
helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek]

Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping
the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by
his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean,
you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles].

Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl.

Mushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep?

Mulan [sadly]:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home.

Mushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll
finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise.

[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site.  Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.  He gets up and glances around]

Shan-Yu [screaming]:  Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh!

[Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop out of the snow and join
Shan-Yu.  They set off towards the Imperial City]

Mulan [seeing them from behind, gasps]:  Huh.  [Mulan runs, grabs her sword, mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to the
Imperial City]

Mushu:  Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan is heading]

Mulan:  I have to do something.

Mushu:  Did you see those Huns!?  They popped out of the snow, like daisies!

Mulan:  Are we in this together or not?

Cri-Kee [emphatically]:  Chirp, Chirp.

Mushu:  Well, let's go kick some Huny buns!  [Jumps onto Khan and utters fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City]  Wu Hu Ha
Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga

[Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City.  Fireworks go off, kites are flying.  The drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed
by the acrobats.  The Parade Leader follows, then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers]

Parade Leader:  Make way for the heros of China.

[Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces.  Mulan rides up through the crowd and stops.  She looks around
and sees Shang in the parade]

Mulan [calling out]:  Shang! [riding next to him]

Shang [surprised]:  Mulan?

Mulan:  The Huns are alive, they're in the city.

Shang:  You don't belong here Mulan, go home.

Mulan [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]:  Shang, I saw them in the mountains.  You have to believe me.

Shang:  Why should I?

Mulan [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]:  Why else would I come back?  You said you'd trust Ping.  Why is Mulan any different?

[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward]

Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]:  Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya.

[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard]

Mushu:  Now where are you going?

Mulan [calling over her shoulder]:  To find someone who will believe me.  [Mulan runs into the palace yard]  

[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him
Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent]

Emperor:  My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors.

[The crowd cheers]

[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd]

Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]:  Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's
touch and moves away] [agitated]  But the Huns are here!  [Mulan walks up to Man #2]  Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks
away from Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard]  No one will listen!

Mushu:  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something?

Mulan [irritatedly]:  Mushu!

Mushu:  Hey, you're a girl again, remember?

[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor]

Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]:  Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu.

Emperor:  I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud.

[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the
sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that
all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's
men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry
the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating
into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts]

Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]:  No.

Yao [beckoning to the other soldiers]:  C'mon.

[Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the Huns inside]

Shan-Yu [laughs evily]:  Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha.

[Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram.  They are unsuccessful at opening the door.  Mulan sees
what's going on and arrives at the steps]

Mulan [to herself]:  They'll never reach the Emperor in time.  [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers.  She
whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]  Hey guys, I've got an idea.  [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards the columns]

[Song:  I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background during the next action sequence]

(Be a man) 
We must be swift as 
the coursing river
(Be a man)
With all the force 
of a great typhoon
(Be a man)
With all the strength 
of a raging fire
Mysterious as the 
dark side of the moon

[Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling
and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and
prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column
to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together]

[End song]

[Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and a high balcony within the palace.  Shan-Yu drops down from the roof]

Shan-Yu:  Boo.  [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2] Guard the door [they walk off down
the stairs that lead to the balcony].  [pacing around the Emperor]  Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.  Bow to me.

[Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come down the stairs and close the door, joining
Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man.  Mulan and company are around the corner]

Mulan [whispering]:  Okay, any questions?

Yao [whispering]:  Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps him]  Ow.

[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans]

Hun Archer:  Who's there?

Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]:  Concubines.

Hun Bald Man #1:  Ugly concubines.

Ling [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]:  Oh he's so cute.

[Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's
dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure]

Shang [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]:  Aww.

[Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk.  Mushu from above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing]

Mushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]:  Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned
falcon doesn't do anything]

[Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a
woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two
heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing
Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist
at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun
Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach
followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back]

Mulan [calling out]:  Shang, GO!

[Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs]

[Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony]

Shan-Yu:  I tire of your arrogance old man.  [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's
throat] Bow to me!

Emperor:  No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it.

Shan-Yu:  Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor]

[Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with
his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column
and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls
to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over
forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind
as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm
pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the
stairs]

Mulan:  Chien-Po, get the Emperor.

Chien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]:  Sorry, your Majesty.  

[Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in
the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu
watches the Emperor leave]

Shan-Yu:  No! 

 [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and
throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the
edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight]

Yao [motioning her to follow]:  Come on!

[Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look.  Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope. 
Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabs
Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope.  Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the
sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.  The crowd cheers]

Shan-Yu:  No!  [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the
throng of people]  Yrraaaaahhhh!

[Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls
out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he
puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away. 
Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the
shirt collar]

Shan-Yu [in Shang's face]:  You, you took away my victory.

[Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet.  Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan]

Mulan:  No!  I did!  [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier]

Shan-Yu [looking at Mulan]:  The soldier from the mountains.

[Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and
through the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right
behind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist. 
Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse
catches up with Mulan]

Mushu:  So what's the plan?

Mulan:  Ummmm.

Mushu:  You don't have a plan?!

Mulan:  Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go. 
Mushu--

Mushu:  I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use
the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower]

[Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword
wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow. 
Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column
causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes
to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to
her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower]

[Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework
lighters) on the edge of the tower] 

Mushu:  Citizens, I need firepower.

Barry Cook:  Who are you?

Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]:  You're
worst nightmare.

[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground]

[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest]

Man in Crowd #1:  On the roof.

Man in Crowd #2:  Look!

[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks
through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her
person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it]

Shan-Yu:  It looks like you're out of ideas.

[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through
the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that
Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping
off the fan with her sword movement]

Mulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu?

Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a
stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights
the fuse]

[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in
the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and
stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan
lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to
run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly
propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the
rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the
roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword]

Mulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof.

[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to
fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs
onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and
releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the
ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by]

Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah
ha ha ha ha.  [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to
Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna]

Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate
attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push
Mulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting.

Shang [in Chi Fu's face]:  She's a hero.

Chi Fu:  'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything.

Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous--

Emperor [walking down the steps]:  That is enough!

Shang:  Your Majesty, I can explain.

[The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear
path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look
waits to write down the words of the Emperor]

Emperor:  I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away
from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army,
destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  [the Emperor bows to Mulan]

[Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan. 
Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing
what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the
ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back]

Mushu:  My little baby's all grown up and savin' China.  [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue?

Emperor:  Chi Fu,

Chi Fu:  Your Excellency?

Emperor:  See to it that this woman is made a member of my council.

Chi Fu [muttering to himself]:  A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said]
what? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty.

Emperor [to Mulan]:  Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu].

Chi Fu [wobbling to and fro]:  What?...My...[faints]

Mulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]:  With all due respect, your Excellency.  I
have been away from home long enough.

Emperor [taking off his pendant]:  Then take this, so your family will know what you have done
for me.  And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu]  so the world will know what you have done
for China.

[Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor]

Yao:  Is she allowed to do that?  [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug]

[Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts
all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground
again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan
starts to smile anticipating something good]

Shang:  Um...[Mulan grins]  You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good.

Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan]

Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm.

[Mulan mounts Khan]

Mulan:  Khan, let's go home.

[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground
level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat]

Emperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all.

Shang [dumbfounded]:  Sir?

Emperor:  You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks
back up the steps to his palace]

[Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands
on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her
approaching and starts to stand]

Fa Zhou:  Mulan.  

[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down]

Mulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of
the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa
Family.

[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. 
He bends down and holds her arms outstretched]

Fa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's
tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so.

Mulan:  I've missed you too Baba.

[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway]

Fa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh

Grandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a
ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]

Shang [just arriving]:  Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here?

[Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position.  Shang walks
toward Mulan and Fa Zhou]

Grandma Fa:  Woo, sign me up for the next war.

[Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou]

Shang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]:  Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up. 
Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet.  Ah but well, actually
it's your helmet, isn't it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean...

[Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over.  Mulan holds the helmet Shang offers]

Mulan:  Would you like to stay for dinner?

Grandma Fa [speaking from stage right]:  Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head with a
smile at Grandma Fa's statement]

Shang [reassuredly to Mulan]:  Dinner would be great.

[Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window.  He watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa
Zhou.  Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor's his head]

Mushu [tugging on First Ancestor's ear]:  C'mon, who did a good job?  C'mon, tell me who did a
good job.

First Ancestor [hesitantly]:  Oh, all right.  You can be a guardian again.

Mushu: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh.  [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the
ancestors]

Mushu:  Take it Cri-Kee.

[Song:  True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song]

[Ancestor 1 does a dance from Pulp Fiction while Ancestor 3 does the Hand Jive]

Ancestor 3 [spoken to Ancestor 1]:  She get's it from my side of the family.

Mushu [spoken while swinging on a chain]:  Call out for egg rolls!

First Ancestor [disgusted]:  Guardians.

[Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple.  Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on the
steps]

Mulan:  Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead].

Little Brother:  Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark  

[Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him.  The
chickens follow him in]

First Ancestor [annoyed]:  Mushu!

THE MYSTERY MEN

By Neil Cuthbert

Based on the Dark Horse comic created by Bob Burden

Revised June 6, 1997



THEME AND CREDITS...

FADE IN:

EXT.  ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING 
INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by 
towers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from 
within...

CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" 
... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as 
CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an 
immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely 
embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET 
BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.

					BIERCE
		No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. 
		Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years 
		he has been with us, I have never seen a 
		patient turn his energies to more productive 
		use.

CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.

					BIERCE
		Just look at his accomplishments... three 
		volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture 
		garden, four romance novels... and who can 
		forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow 
		in our all-psychotic production of 
		"Carousel"...

ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that 
brilliant performance...

					BIERCE
		Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.

ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top 
shrink.

A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, 
sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of 
seduction.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago I was a lost soul.  
		Loveless...
		(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)
		Fatherless...
		(chokes on the word)
		A... psycho!
		(breaks down sobbing)
		Oh!  How could I have done it? The murder... 
		the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!
		(weeping, a brilliant performance)
		I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!

Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board, 
moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.

					CASANOVA
				(pulls himself together)
		But my deeds have been done, and my youth is 
		gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel 
		world... and if I have learned anything from my 
		wretched life it is that... When you walk 
		through a storm, keep your head held high...
					(singing)
		And don't be afraid of the dark...

Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY 
ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL...

SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES

A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and 
embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a 
paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.

In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit 
(that's been waiting far him for twenty years).

Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the 
lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the 
hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an 
office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board 
stand watching, very proud...

But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari 
drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the 
review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a 
nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...

Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up 
at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... 
Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get 
in the car.

INT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Casanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen 
through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his 
watch...

CLOSE ON HIS WATCH -

as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve 
noon...

BACK ON CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
				(almost wistfully)
		Boom.

And the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes 
it.

					CASANOVA
		Those gas leaks can be murder.

EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY

The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads 
"We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing". The city itself, a 
crumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out 
along the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...

INSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
		I'm home.

BACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS

The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the 
road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed 
classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads 
"Crime.  Don't even think about it."

EXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

Letters read "Six months later"...

as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, 
CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...

CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then 
pulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a 
ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time 
thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading 
their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down 
the ramp.

					RED EYE 1
		Golf anyone?

Several more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes 
still attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of 
the line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the 
door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.

					RED EYE 2
		Not a bad night's work.

					BIG RED
		Who said crime don't pay?

The Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby 
stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.

					RED EYE 3
		Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.

The crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs 
at them.

					RED EYE 4
				(about to slug him)
		Who you laughin' at, punk?

					RED EYE 2
		He's just a tyke.  Lighten up.

					RED EYE 5
		He's kinda cute.

					RED EYE 3
		If you like drool.

					RED EYE 2
		Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents?  
		For a million bucks!

The others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.

					BIG RED
		And what if he rats on us?

The others hadn't thought of that.

					RED EYE 3
		So what should we do with him?

					BIG RED
		Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in 
		the lake.

The others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.

					RED EYE 3
		Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.

But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and 
cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE 
RAJA.

					RAJA
		Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term 
		loosely... Unhand that youngster...

Another man steps into the light.  He wears a construction helmet and 
mask.  There is an "S" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel.  He 
is THE SHOVELER.

					SHOVELER
		Or you're mulch.

He brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two, 
highly amused.

					BIG RED
		What are you guys supposed to be... 
		superheroes?

A third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others.  
He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames 
on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his 
haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous 
of the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.

					FURIOUS
		We ARE superheroes!

					BIG RED
		Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?

The crooks howl with laughter.

					BIG RED
		This is our territory.  Beat it.

					FURIOUS
		Over YOUR dead body.

Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.

					BIG RED
		0ooooo, he's scary.

The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes 
through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls 
with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.

					BIG RED
		A fork!

The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver 
forks.

					RAJA
		And there's plenty more where that came from.

Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of 
an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He 
is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, 
taking huge bites out of it, container and all.

RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd 
bargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.

					BIG RED
		GET 'EM!

The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his 
hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming 
crooks...

A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his 
shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with 
pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, 
poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, 
watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real 
martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley 
brouhaha.)

But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging 
fists... and so does the Shoveler...

Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and 
rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of 
him and crushing him under his massive weight.

					RED EYES
		Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!

					FURIOUS
			(barely audible under all that meat)
		Is that all you got?

					RED EYES
		He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him 
		off!

					FURIOUS
					(faintly)
		Your mother!

Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative 
voice is heard.

					VOICE (0.S.)
		Is there a problem?

Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN 
AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the 
light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique 
sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting 
heroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate.

ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...

					RED EYES
		IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!

Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca-
like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his 
hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing 
deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly 
delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he 
doesn't even break a sweat.

The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in 
surrender.

					RED EYES
		We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible 
		childhoods!  (Etc.)

Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and 
the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and 
reporters...

Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh 
as a daisy).

					RAJA
		Nice work, Captain.

But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they 
didn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer 
to Connie Chung).

					AMAZING
			(turning on the old superhero charm)
		Hi. Dawn.

					DAWN
			(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)
		Looks like you've done it again, Captain.

					AMAZING
		It's what I do.

Our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated.  Furious growls.  
Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.

					COP 1
		Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand--
		we're superheroes, and we just busted up this 
		gang.

					COP 1
		Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and 
		he's...
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Captain Pooper Scooper!

The cops crack up.  Furious growls at them.  The cops yank out their 
nightsticks.

					COP 1
		Hey!  Move it!

					COP 2
		Get a life!

					COP 1
		And leave crime fighting to the real thing!

Shoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble... 
The cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.

					COP 1
		Wannabes.

					COP 2
		Pathetic.

EXT.  THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

An inner city greasy spoon.

INT.  THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being 
interviewed by Dawn Wong.  He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its 
worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  Dawn is creaming.

Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the 
tube...

					RAJA
				(nursing a sore jaw)
		He doesn't miss a trick, does he?

					FURIOUS
		What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!

					SHOVELER
		Oh don't start that again--

					FURIOUS
		LOOK!

Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good 
looking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads "Lance Hunt 
Hosts Benefit."  He holds the picture up next to the television, so the 
faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.  It is 
obviously the same guy.

					FURIOUS
		He's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses--
		and it's him!

					RAJA
		There's a vague similarity.

					FURIOUS
		A vague similarity?  IT'S THE SAME GUY!

					SHOVELER
				(downing some aspirin)
		0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take 
		this anymore.  Night after night we're on the 
		streets, busting our humps--and for what?

					RAJA
		We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

					SHOVELER
		How long do you have to chase a dream before 
		you realize it's not gonna happen?

					FURIOUS
		We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever 
		heard of him until he busted Casanova 
		Frankenstein!

					RAJA
		But look at him... and look at us.

					SHOVELER
		The camera loves him.

A depressed silence.  Furious turns his attention to the napkin 
dispenser.

					FURIOUS
				     (furious)
		Why do they always fill stuff these things so 
		full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 
		'em!
				   (rips one out)

					RAJA
		I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting 
		suspicious, I know it.

					FURIOUS
		So why don't you just tell her!

					RAJA
		I can't.

					FURIOUS
		Why not?

					RAJA
				     (upset)
		Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't 
		understand!

					SHOVELER
		Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours.

					FURIOUS
		We had an off night, that's all.

					SHOVELER
		So when are we gonna have an on night?

A WAITRESS is standing at the table.

					WAITRESS
		Hi.

They look at her, taken aback.  She's very pretty.

					RAJA
		You're... new.

					WAITRESS
		It's my first night.  My name's Monica.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her.  
Under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

					MONICA
		You guys going to a costume party?

					RAJA
		We're superheroes.

					MONICA
		Really?  Like Captain Amazing?

Furious growls.

					MONICA
		Are you famous?

					RAJA
		Not yet.

					MONICA
		So you're like... struggling superheroes?

					RAJA
		We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I 
		am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
				(does a very impressive
				little flipping thing with
				his place setting)

					MONICA
		Wow.

					RAJA
		And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler.
	
					SHOVELER
		Hi.

					RAJA
		And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

					MONICA
				(intrigued by Furious)
		Really?

					RAJA
		Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or 
		a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely 
		emotional.

					MONICA
		So what can I get you?

					RAJA
		Burgers all around.
				(meaning himself)
		Medium.
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Rare.
				(meaning Furious}
		Raw.

A moment later as Monica walks away, Furious can't help but
watch her.  The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good 
stuff from his coat.

					RAJA
		She likes you.

					SHOVELER
		Definitely.

					RAJA
		Ask her out.

					FURIOUS
		Nah.

					RAJA
		Roy, when was the last time you had an actual 
		date?

					FURIOUS
				(getting very pissed off)
		What does it matter?  Women just want to 
		control you--and talk about their feelings.  
		They want to know why you're angry all the 
		time--and what can they can do to help--so you 
		tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave 
		me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and 
		they bug you--until you just can't stand it 
		anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like 
		a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all 
		your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all 
		of it!
					(after a beat)
		And then they dump you.

					RAJA
		So you're chicken?

					FURIOUS
				     (fiercely)
		Who's chicken?
					(gets up)

Monica stands at the counter placing her order.  Furious approaches 
her, leans against the counter.  For a moment he just stands there, 
fuming, unable to think of anything to say. She isn't sure what to make 
of this.

					FURIOUS
		Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you 
		really want to talk to somebody you can't think 
		of anything to say!

					MONICA
		I guess... Are you always so angry?

					FURIOUS
		Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

She shrugs.

					FURIOUS
		Want to go out and get drunk?

She's visibly turned off by that.

					FURIOUS
		Or talk?

					MONICA
		Not tonight.
			(picks up an order and walks away)

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE DINER - LATER

Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.

					RAJA
		Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

					FURIOUS
			(gets on his old Harley)
		Like what?  Cutting off my own ear?

					RAJA
		Or flowers.

					FURIOUS
		See ya tomorrow.

Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the 
Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and 
the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The Shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. The 
front yard looks like a battle zone.  Bikes and kids' junk are 
everywhere.

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

as big a disaster area as the front yard. His kids, EDDIE JR. (15), 
LENORE (12), BUTCH (10), TRACY (7), and ROLAND (5) are all sprawled in 
front of the television. The Shoveler enters, and his kids don't even 
bother to look up from the tube.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place 
		up?

					TRACY
		When you're on TV.

					EDDIE JR.
		Right--like that will ever happen.

					LENORE
		Save any babies lately?

ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.

					TRACY
		Faster than a speeding turtle--

					BUTCH
		More powerful than a deodorant--

					EDDIE JR.
		Able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--

					LENORE
		Look, snoring in his chair--

					EDDIE JR.
		Sitting on the john--

					ALL
		It's... Supergut!

The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well) as the 
Shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

The Shoveler enters, dejected.  His wife, Lucille, is doing the dishes.  
She looks up, sees him.

					LUCILLE
				  (feels for him)
		Rough night, Eddie?

He nods.

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The Raja's Datsun is parked in front of a neat as a pin little 
Victorian house.

INT.  THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Someone is sneaking around.  A drawer is quietly 
opened, and we hear the gentle clink of silver. Suddenly, the light 
goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and 
slacks, with his hand in the drawer.  His MOTHER, in her nightclothes, 
stands by the door where she has just switched on the light.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey!

					RAJA
		Oh hi, Mom.

					MOTHER
		What are you doing in the silver drawer?

					RAJA
		Looking for... the TV Guide.

She just looks at him, very suspicious.

					MOTHER
		It's on the television.

					RAJA
		Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.  
		Go to bed.

He kisses her and goes into the next room.  CAMERA HOLDS ON MOM; she 
doesn't trust him.

EXT.  HILLTOP - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

A billboard overlooking the city.  Captain Amazing is posed wearing a 
pair of bright blue Nikes.  The caption reads. "It's a nice world.  
Sonebody's got to save it... The Nike Supershoe.  It's Amazing."

Furious sits on his Harley, taking long hauls from a pint bottle of 
cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign.

					FURIOUS
		Amazing?  What's so amazing about him?  I'd be 
		amazing, too, if I'd inherited two hundred 
		million bucks... or two bucks... or two 
		cents...
			(hurls the empty bottle, smashing
				it against the sign)
		Who am I kidding?  Dreams don't come true.

A moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and 
looks up...

HIS POV -

as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above 
him...

It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...


					FURIOUS
		Where's he going?
			(kicks his Harley started)

SERIES OF SHOTS - WITH MUSIC

as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep 
hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential 
area...

He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and 
rides smoothly along it, following Amazing... He turns off the tracks, 
rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and 
sees..

A foreboding looking old mansion... Captain Amazing lands on the 
highest part of its roof... Furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates 
of the mansion...

HIS POV -

Letters across the iron gates read... "Frankenstein".

EXT.  ON THE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate 
roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking 
along a high ridge like a tight rope walker. Finally he approaches a 
skylight, looks down and sees...

A huge old library with an iron catwalk running around it. Casanova 
Frankenstein sits in a club chair by a roaring tire. Anabel perches on 
the arm of his chair.  In the other chair sits a once good looking, now 
paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.  He is TONY 
POMPADOUR, head of the infamous Disco Boys.

0N CAPTAIN AMAZING

					AMAZING
				(just as he suspected)
		Uh-huh.

He sees that the skylight is open, and quietly lets himself in...

INT.  THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Tony P savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a 
		dozen Cubans to get them.

					TONY P
		Ummm.

					CASANOVA
		Have you considered my offer?

					TONY P
		You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved 
		workin' for you.  You had such style: the 
		clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd 
		snuff a babe.  You were the King...

Casanova accepts this graciously.

					TONY P
		But times have changed, and you been in that 
		bug house a long tine. I can see you still got 
		the style, but I dunno for sure you still got 
		the edge.

					CASANOVA
		I got it.

					TONY P
		What about Captain Amazing?

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Good question.

Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly 
on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.  Tony P jumps out of his 
chair, scared.  But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as 
a cucumber.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open 
		for you.

					AMAZING
		I know you did.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd know.

					AMAZING
		I know you knew I'd know.

					CASANOVA
		But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?

					AMAZING
		Of course.

Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips 
out his pistol, getting the drop on him.

					AMAZING
		I'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of 
		scum like you, Tony.

Tony freezes.

					AMAZING
		The jig is up, Casanova.  I've spent six months 
		watching you, and know exactly what you're up 
		to.

					CASANOVA
		Really?

					AMAZING
		I know that you're recruiting your old 
		henchmen...

Nervous reaction from Tony P.

					AMAZING
		I know who your girlfriend really is...

Icy reaction from Anabel.

					AMAZING
		And I know the terrible revenge that you plan 
		to inflict on this city.

					CASANOVA
		I guess you know just about everything, don't 
		you, Lance?

					AMAZING
		Um-hmm.

					CASANOVA
		Except for one little thing.

					AMAZING
				(supremely confident)
		And what's that?

					CASANOVA
		That I've hot wired the city's entire power 
		supply through that catwalk.

					AMAZING
		What--?

Casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a 
million volts instantly fills the room...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - ON FURIOUS

still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a 
frightening orange glow in an upper room...

Off in the distance Furious sees... the lights of the entire city 
flicker and then black out... A moment later the mansion, and the 
city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to 
make of this.

EXT. STREET CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Traffic is snarled.  Horns are blasting.  Tempers are frayed.

CLOSE ON A HAMMERING JACKHAMMER... CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL that it is 
being operated by the Shoveler, dressed in work clothes.  Wiped out 
from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off 
to sleep... He nods out... as his BOSS whacks him on the arm.

					BOSS
		YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at 
		home, or you'll be a full time superhero!

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT.  THE RAJA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as 
he watches... an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.

					ANTHONY
		It's all within your power.  The only thing 
		that's in your way is YOU!

					RAJA
		Easy for you to say.

EXT.  SALLY'S AUTO DEMOLITION - DAY - ESTABLISHING

An auto junkyard and demotion yard.

EXT.  THE YARD - DAY

A giant press mashes an old car... while nearby Mister Furious does the 
job by hand, demolishing an old Grand Prix with an iron bar.  He does 
it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping 
off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing 
the pieces onto a big pile... His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is 
calling out to him.

					SALLY
		Hey, Roy!

EXT.  THE BACK OF THE YARD - A MINUTE LATER

In a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard Sally and Furious stand 
looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. It is a Herkimer Battle 
Jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier 
(designed by the Pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on 
battlefield fact finding tours).  Overgrown with weeds, home to an 
extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are 
over.

					SALLY
		How many times I gotta tell you about this?

					FURIOUS
		Sally, that's a Herkimer Battle Jitney!  They 
		don't make 'em like that anymore.  It's a 
		classic!

					SALLY
		It's a hunk of junk.  I want the iron.  Do it!

She walks away.  Furious growls.  He picks up his iron bar and is about 
to wedge it under the front bumper of the Herkimer...

HIS POV -

But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at 
hint, imploring him for one last chance...

And he just can't do it.  He throws away his iron bar and climbs inside 
the cab of the Herkimer...

IN THE CAB - CONTINUOUS

Furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat-up old 
dashboard, then turns on the radio, which, miraculously still works.  
He tunes in a local station, puts his feet up on the dash.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		...and continues to deny any knowledge of the 
		incident... In local news, millionaire Lance 
		Hunt has apparently disappeared...

ON FURIOUS, taking immediate notice.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		Members at his household told police that the 
		playboy philanthropist failed to return home 
		last night after "going out for a walk".  
		Police say they have no reason yet to suspect 
		foul play, but a search is under way...

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Furious, the Shoveler, and the Raja all sit at their booth.

					FURIOUS
		I saw him go in--and he didn't come out!
	
					RAJA
		But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

Furious groans.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, look.

ON THE TV -

Casanova is being interviewed by DON STOUFFER, the local Mike Wallace.

					CASANOVA
		Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my 
		life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to 
		give back something to my old home town... 
		That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune 
		to build...

CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure 
(i.e.  the Getty)

					CASANOVA (O.S.)
		The Frankenstein Center for the Arts.

					DON
		You've changed, haven't you?

		CASANOVA
		Oh yes.

BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER - 

					FURIOUS
		No he hasn't.

EXT.  FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

the wall of the estate... as our heroes' three heads rise up over  
it... and survey the grounds.

					FURIOUS
				(about to climb over)
		Let's go.

					RAJA
			(in a whisper, holding him back)
		Wait!... Look!

THEIR POV -

A group of men are hanging around the door to the house, smoking, 
chatting, and laughing.  A CLOSER ANGLE REVEALS that they are all 
dressed in the height (or depths) of seventies disco fashion.  One of 
them is showing off some steps.

Our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer.


					RAJA
		This is bad.

					SHOVELER
		Who are they?

					RAJA
		The Disco Boys.


					FURIOUS
		The who?

					RAJA
		The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever 
		produced.  Twenty years ago they were 
		Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he 
		was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

					FURIOUS
		Well they've crawled back out.

					SHOVELER
		We may be getting in over our heads here.

					RAJA
		This looks like a job for Superman--

					SHOVELER
		Or Batman--

					RAJA
		Or both.

					FURIOUS
		Don't you guys get it?  If Captain Amazing is 
		still in there, we can rescue him--and get on 
		TV!
			   (goes right over the wall)

They share an exasperated look, then scramble over the wall after him.

INT.  CASANOVA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Dr. Anabel Leek are preparing for bed.  Anabel sits in 
front of a huge mirror, brushing her long hair as Casanova moves up 
behind her and puts his hands around her throat, massaging, squeezing, 
just barely resisting the temptation to strangle her.  (She loves it).

					CASANOVA
		Everything's going exactly as we planned.

					ANABEL
			(puts the sharp point of her
			comb handle under his chin)
		Not quite.  You haven't announced our 
		engagement yet.

					CASANOVA
		It must have slipped my mind.

					ANABEL
		Your mind is so slippery.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are 
		over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my 
		Nicole.
				(pulls her into his arms)
		We're such an incredible team.  Who could 
		possibly stop us?
		(kisses her)

CUT RIGHT TO:

EXT.  THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS - ON OUR THREE HEROES

as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.

					RAJA
		Don't crunch the leaves.

					SHOVELER
		Sorry.

					RAJA
		Be a Mohican.
	    		   (bumps into a lawn chair)

					FURIOUS
		Wait.
				(They all stop.)
		I hear something.

They all listen; there is a low rushing sound... It is the sound of 
water rushing through pipes.  Suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop 
up... and our heroes get drenched.  They duck off the lawn, behind the 
cover of a large tree.

					RAJA
		I'm soaked.
				    (sneezes)
		Oh great.

					FURIOUS
		Shhh.

					SHOVELER
		Be a Mohican. 

					RAJA
		Shut up.

Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.  One of the 
doors is slightiy open.

					FURIOUS
		Come on.

They start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip 
the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in 
light.

					RAJA
		Uh-oh.

As our heroes look around as a dozen Disco Boys, armed with pipes, 
chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... The 
French doors open and Tony P steps out.

					RAJA
		Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house.

					TONY P
		You sure do.

The Disco Boys attack.  The Raja is instantly clubbed down. The 
Shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes 
down, too... These guys are not the Red Eyes.

Only Furious holds his own.  He grabs a pipe away from one of them and 
swings fiercely, keeping the others off.  Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull 
back.  Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...

Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.

					CASANOVA
		Hi there.

With a cat-like move Casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and 
repeatedly--across Furious' face.  Furious, stunned with pain, lunges 
at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast 
combination of spinning disco kicks.  Finally he lassos the chain 
around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.

ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...

Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.  Casanova steps 
away, and the Disco Boys gather around Furious and kick him 
viciously... as Casanova and Tony P watch, amused, chuckling.

					CASANOVA
		Superheroes.

					TONY P
		Should I kill them?

					CASANOVA
				(completely disdainful)
		Why bother?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like 
bags of garbage into the street... where thay lie in a moaning, 
agonized, semi-conscious heap.

INT.  THE DINER - LATER - CLOSE ON

Furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. The three of 
them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and 
groaning... Monica approaches.  She's made them ice packs and cold 
compresses.

					MONICA
		Here you go.
			(sits with them, applies a compress
				to the Raja's head)

					RAJA
		Ow.

					MONICA
		Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero 
		stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

A FUSSY CUSTOMER is calling out from another table.

					FUSSY CUSTORER
		Miss!

She moves off.

					RAJA
		Maybe she's right.

					FURIOUS
				(still furious)
		Are you serious? This is the break we've been 
		waiting for!

					SHOVELER
		What are you talking about?

					FURIOUS
		What have the famous superheroes got that we 
		don't?

					RAJA
		Agents?

					FURIOUS
		Archenemies!  Casanova isn't just a criminal--
		he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our 
		ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!

					SHOVELER
		And it would be the right thing to do.

					FURIOUS
				   (dismissively)
		Yeah yeah--and that, too.

					RAJA
		But there's only three of us, and he's got the 
		entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.

					FURIOUS
		Then maybe it's time for us to form our own 
		brotherhood...
					(more)
	
					FURIOUS (Cont'd)
		a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, 
		skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of 
		the night!

					SHOVELER
		I'm liking this.

					FURIOUS
		I say we send out the word--and summon all of 
		the unsung superheroes we know!

					RAJA
				(after a moment)
		Yeah, but... who do we know?

They take a long moment to ponder this.

					FURIOUS
		Well... there's the Spleen.

Shoveler and Raja make disgusted noises.

					RAJA
		Do we have to?

					SHOVELER
		I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he 
		claims he can become invisible.

					FURIOUS
		Have you ever seen him?

					SHOVELER
		How could I see him if he's invisible?

					FURIOUS 
		Good point.

					RAJA
		And there's the Sphinx.

					SHOVELER
		The who?

					RAJA
		He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting 
		superwrestler and master of the machete.

					FURIOUS
		Sounds good.

					RAJA
		No one's sure that he actually exists, but they 
		say he can be contacted by leaving a message on 
		a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by 
		the bus station.

					SHOVELER
		Get outta here.

EXT.  TACKY TACO - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A funky Mexican restaurant by the bus station.

INT.  THE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch.  
Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.

					FURIOUS
		You sure that's how you spell it?

					SHOVELER
		Yeah.

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Spinks, we need you."

They crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant... A moment later a 
shy looking MEXICAN MAN busses their tray... but in A CLOSE ANGLE we 
see him secretly pocket the napkin.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A little brick house.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of 
the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc.  
INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister 
Furious, and the Shoveler.

					FURIOUS
		So, let me get this straight.  You have the 
		power to become invisible.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		But... only when no one is looking.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		If someone looks at you, you immediately become 
		visible again.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible... to yourself?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		No.

					OUR HEROES
					(hopefully)
		No?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		If I look at myseif, I become visible.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no 
		one is looking at you?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		So how do you know that you've ever been 
		invisible?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I just know.

Our heroes are less than impressed.

					FURIOUS
		Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to 
		interview--

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(desperate)
		I know I haven't got it entirely worked out 
		yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a 
		superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? 
		Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a 
		chance?

ON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Our heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a 
weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit.  Across 
his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and 
that's exactly who he is.  Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far 
away from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive 
person... and he is thrilled to be there.

					SPLEEN
		Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when 
		you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?
				   (sucks it in)
		I've always dreamed of being a member of the a 
		real superhero team--and to have friends--real 
		friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep 
		with--die with--eat with...

He puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into 
his mouth.

					SPLEEN
		I love mustard.

Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've 
actually invited this guy to join their group.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		So what exactly is your superpower?

					SPLEEN
		Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal-
		-remember that?--and my brothers and I used to 
		go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it--
		stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, 
		but I lived, and I grew all these like weird 
		organs that have never been seen in humans 
		before.  So now I can do things like this!

He leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle 
dribble onto the table...

CLOSE ON THE TABLE -

as the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.

					SPLEEN
		Cool, huh?

The Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three 
heroes duck out of the way or under the table.

				FURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER
		Watch it!... Look out!... Whoa!

The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands 
to their mouths, and immediately leave.

					SPLEEN
		Sorry, sorry.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?

					SPLEEN
		I tried that once.  The cork melted.

THE SAME - AFTER DINNER

Our heroes mull their situation over coffee.  Monica freshens their 
cups.  The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.

					SHOVELER
		There's just not enough of us.

					FURIOUS
		But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe 
		thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who 
		desperately need a cause...

					RAJA
		And a social life.

					SHOVELER
		Yeah, but how do we get to them?

					SPLEEN
		Obscene phone calls?

They ignore that suggestion.

					MONICA
		Why don't you throw a barbecue?
			(moves off to another table)

ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC

Invisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little 
notes on small file cards.  (He's made a whole pile of them.)

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Got superpowers?  Want to fight evil?  Then JOIN US and 
let's PARTY HEARTY!  Beer!  Burgers!  Babes!"

SERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES

as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where 
lonely superheroes night find them...

The Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...

The Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...

Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone 
booth...

At an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through 
the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...

A White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is 
scratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his 
handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the 
wall...

END MUSIC.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY

A small, typical working class backyard.  A round, aluminum above 
ground pool.  A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of 
hamburger rolls.  An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.  The 
Spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.

					SPLEEN
		Come on in!  The water's great!

In fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our 
heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  No superheroes have shown 
up.  The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand 
in line waiting for them.

					BUTCH
				(heavy on the sarcasm)
		Great picnic, Dad.

					EDDIE JR.
		Big turnout.

					ROLAND
		Are these guys real superheroes?

					LENORE
		They think so.

The kids scoff...  A moment later they head back to the house with 
their burgers.

					ROLAND
		But where's Captain Amazing?

					EDDIE JR.
		He wouldn't be caught dead here.

They go into the house.  No one says anything.  The Shoveler just 
stares at the burgers on the grill.  Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his 
beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.

ON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.

					SPLEEN
		Hey, these pool mints are delicious!

Raja looks at his watch.

					RAJA
		Maybe there was traffic.

					FURIOUS
		Who are we kidding?  No one's gonna show.  
		We're living in a fantasy!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.

					FURIOUS
		Good or evil, what's the difference?

					SHOVELER
		There's a big difference.

					FURIOUS
		I used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.

					RAJA
		Roy, remember, it is all within your power.  
		The only thing that's in your way... is you.

					FURIOUS
		Oh shut up.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  Everyone immediately perks up.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		They're here!

A moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS 
wearing various superhero outfits.

					THEIR LEADER
		Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?

					RAJA
		This is it.  Come on in!

					SUPERHEROES
		All right!  Party!  (Etc.)

At first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are 
decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain 
capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  Their leader holds a 
squeegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.

					RAJA
		I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.

					THEIR LEADER
		I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, 
		the Invincible Dudes!

The Invincible Dudes spot the keg.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.)

They go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling 
them down.  The Raja tries to hand out some forms.

					RAJA
		Would you mind filling out these forms; names, 
		addresses, description of superpowers, that 
		sort of thing.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Sure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.)
			(but they just toss the forms away)

ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 1
		Hey, man, like where are the babes?

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 2
		It said on the card there'd be babes!

					RAJA
		Actually we lied about the babes, but there's 
		plenty of burgers.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		That's false advertising!... We came all the 
		way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone 
		plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No babes.  No peace.

					INVISIBLE DUDES (chanting)
		No babes--no peace!  No babes--no peace!  No 
		babes--no peace!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		Let's trash the place!

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Yeah!

Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.

					FURIOUS
		If you're a superhero, what's your power?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		I am Squeegee Man.
			(holding it out threateningly)
		Touch my squeegee... and you die.

The Invincible Dudes are cracking up.

					FURIOUS
		Can you fly?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No.

					FURIOUS
		Wanna bet?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS

as Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing 
none too gracefully in the front yard.

A beat and his squeegee come flying out after him.  Another beat and 
the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!

They take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a 
bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero 
costume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER

Our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		Who died?

They look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to 
make of her.

					RAJA
		Who are you?

					BOWLER
		I'm the Bowler.

					SHOVELER
		The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a
		kid.  He was killed years ago.

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

Our heroes share a look.

					SHOVELER
		Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a
		guy thing.

					BOWLER
		Really?

She takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like 
a Harlem Globetrotter).  For a long moment she just looks at them, 
smiling.

ON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...

Suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the 
ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war 
club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...

Then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots 
straight through Invisible Boy's legs...

ON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -

as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a 
reverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to 
the Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.

					BOWLER
		Good ball.

ON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.

					BOWLER
		If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be 
		impressed, right?

She turns and walks out.  Our heroes share an amazed look, then run 
after her...

JUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER

walking away... as Furious catches up with her.

					FURIOUS
		Hey... Can I buy you a beer?

					BOWLER
		I thought you'd never ask.

She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's 
backyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place 
between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a 
frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep 
shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  We do not 
know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

BACK AT THE BARBECUE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON

A FADED OLD SNAPSHOT of the original "The Bowler" holding a little girl 
in his arms.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		He was more than just a superhero...  He was my 
		father...

The others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is 
holding the old snapshot in her hand.

					BOWLER
		And then one day, he didn't come home.  The 
		police said it was an accident.  But cargo 
		containers don't just fall on people.  He was 
		murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped 
		out of school, became a mud wrestler, married 
		and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit 
		bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her 
		attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and 
		costume, almost like he'd left them there for 
		me... and I knew what I had to do.

					SHOVELER
		So who killed him?
	
					BOWLER
		The Disco Boys.

					FURIOUS
		You know something? Those guys are really 
		starting TO PISS ME OFF!

					SHOVELER
		But there's still only six of us.

					FURIOUS
		SO WHAT?

					BOWLER
		That's two more than the Fantastic Four.

					FURIOUS
		Half a Dirty Dozen!

					SPLEEN
		Twice the Three Stooges!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		And only one short of the Magnificent Seven.

					RAJA
		And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.

					BOWLER
		He was cute though.

					RAJA
		But they all had one thing we haven't got.

					SPLEEN
		Girlfriends?

					RAJA
		A name.  All the great superhero teams have got 
		a fabulous name.

They all think about it for a moment.  You can almost smell their 
brains overheating.

					BOWLER
		How about... the Savage Six?

					RAJA
		The Inscrutable Six?

					SPLEEN
		The Six Pistols?

					SHOVELER
		The Exterminators!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The Obliterators!

					RAJA
		The Eradicators!

					BOWLER
		The Emasculators!

					SPLEEN
		Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.

He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.

					FURIOUS
		To hell with a name.  Let's get to work.

MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.  The others stand and follow 
him... as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as A LITTLE OLD LADY crosses the street, when suddenly 
she looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast.  An 
immaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her.

INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Disco Boys sit in the front.  Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the 
back, dressed for a night on the town...

There is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car 
explodes into laughter.

					TONY P
		Little old lady.  That's a hundred points!

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE LIMO - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for "MILK" with a milk 
mustached Captain Amazing looking at the camera...

					TONY P
		He knows your every move.

Tony P imitates a massive electrical convulsion, and the villains crack 
up.

But as they pass the billboard, a pair of headlights illuminate in its 
shadows, and the Shoveler's Ford Esquire pulls out and follows.

INSIDE THE ESQUIRE - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is driving.  Mister Furious sits in the front seat next to 
him, and our other heroes are packed into the back.

					FURIOUS
		Let's say hello.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE TWO CARS - CONTINUOUS

As the limo stops at a traffic light... and the Esquire pulls up 
alongside it.  For a moment good and evil stare each other down.

					TONY P
		Not these guys again!

The Disco Boys howl with laughter.

					CASANOVA
		Nice car.

The D Boys laugh.  Furious stares at Casanova, and Casanova stares 
right back at him, as cool as a snake.

					FURIOUS
		What did you do with Captain Amazing?

					CASANOVA
		Captain who?

					TONY P
				(spots the Bowler)
		Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed to 
		be, the Bowler?

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

					TONY P
		His daughter?  Well guess what, sweetheart?  
		I'm the one who squished your Daddy.  And he 
		squished real good!

The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.  He swings 
open his car door, mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent.

					TONY P
		HEY!

					FURIOUS
		'SCUSE ME!

He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents 
in it.

					TONY
		Waste him!

Tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols--but as 
they yank them out, the Spleen sticks his head out of the station 
wagon, puts his face right up to the open window of the limo and lets 
loose with a TREMENDOUS BELCH...

As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes 
on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big 
dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening 
the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the 
back of his hand...

Then he leaps up on top of the limo...

While inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into 
the roof above them...

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHEILD as Furious leaps down onto the hood, and 
gazes in at them.

					FURIOUS
		Shall I check your oil?

He plunges his hand through the metal of the hood, pulls out the car's 
dip stick, and checks it.

					FURIOUS
		Looks fine.

He tosses the dip stick away, then leaps off JUST AS Tony P gets off a 
shot, EXPLODING the windshield of the limo.

Furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon.  As the Shoveler 
throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...

					FURIOUS
		NICE CAR!

And our heroes streak off into the night... Casanova and the others 
stagger out of the demolished limo, sucking in the clean air.

					CASANOVA
				(impressed by Furious)
		That boy's got talent.

					TONY P
		And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

ANGLE ON A DARKENED ALLEY -

where the man in the strange steel mask can be seen... watching.

EXT.  A BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.

					SHOVELER
		To us!

					RAJA
		Whatever our name is.

They toast and drink.

THE SAME - LATER

The Spleen is passed out at a table, snoring. Shoveler and Invisible 
Boy sit next to him.

					SHOVELER
		Even his snores smell bad.

Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.

					BOWLER
		But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her.

					RAJA
		I can't.

ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid 
		waste of time.

					SHOVELER
		But he plays golf, right?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yeah.

BACK ON RAJA AND BOWLER -

					RAJA
		I'm her only son, and she always had such high 
		hopes for me. Medicine.  Law.

					BOWLER
		But you're a superhero.

					RAJA
		The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't 
		understand.

					BOWLER
		I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I 
		put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it.

					RAJA
		But in fact... you'd found it.

They clink their glasses and drink.

BACK ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY -

					SHOVELER
		This is your dream... and you can't ever give 
		it up.

The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I wonder what he dreams about?

					SHOVELER
		We don't want to know.

Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry 
thoughts..

OUTSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

A black van drives slowly past the bar.

INSIDE THE VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van is packed with Disco Boys.  Tony P sits in the front seat.

					TONY P
		There.

HIS POV -

He has spotted the Ford Esquire parked in the lot.

BACK IN THE BAR - A LITTLE LATER

ON THE BOWLER AND RAJA -

					BOWLER
		It's late.  I'm headin' home.

					RAJA
		Me, too.

					BOWLER
				(to Invisible Boy)
		Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

JUST OUTSIDE - A MONENT LATER

As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.

					FURIOUS
		Anybody up for a little White Castle?

But suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they 
are bushwhacked by the Disco Boys...

EXT.  AN ALLEY - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as he comes to with a qroan and sees... the Bowler and Invisible Boy 
tied up and gagged, with the Raja, Shoveler, and the Spleen trussed up 
right next to them.  Furious looks up, sees Tony P standing over him.

					TONY P
		Hi, cutie.

Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire 
chains.  Tony P takes out a large caliber revolver, flips it open to 
make sure it's loaded.

					TONY P
		Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect... Got any 
		last words, Angry Boy?

					FURIOUS
		Disco sucks.

					TONY P
		Disco sucks.  Very good.  You know what I'm 
		gonna do, Angry Boy, since you're so colorful?  
		I'm gonna save you for last.

He turns and points the pistol right at Invisible Boy's head. Furious 
struggles against his chains--to no avail.

					TONY P
		Sweet dreams, punk.

Invisible Boy closes his eyes... Tony P cocks the pistol... But 
suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the 
air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.

					TONY P
				(holding half a pistol)
		HOLY...

The man is the strange steel mask is standing there, the drawn machete 
still in his hand.

					MAN IN MASK
		Buenos naches.

					TONY P
		Get him!

The Disco Boys rush the newcomer, but he slices through their baseball 
bats with his machete, and sends them reeling and crashing into each 
other with expert forearm blows, whacks with the flat of his blade, and 
head butts with his mask.

Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are 
too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help.

Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who 
sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him.  Tony P 
turns, about to charge again.

					MAN IN MASK
				    (Mexican accent)
		Would you like me to trim the sides?

					TONY P
		What?

Tony P feels the top of his head, and realizes that the blow from the 
machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco-do, leaving only 
stubble on the top of his head.

					TONY P
			     	  (freaking out)
		LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

Tony and the Disco Boys run for it...

Furious and the others study their masked savior, who stands before 
them, machete in hand.

					FURIOUS
		You're the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		And you are a fool.

He raises his machete above Furious' head... and then slices clean 
through the chains.

EXT.	AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum. They 
sit on the ground and on old car seats, feeling like schmucks as the 
Sphinx chews theu out, his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in 
the flickering light.

					SPHINX
		You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster 
		fights more intelligently than you!  You have 
		shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your 
		powers to him--and what have you accouplished 
		for this?  You have destroyed his car.  
		Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must 
		fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!

Furious sulks, but the others get the point.

					SPHINX
		The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is 
		his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a 
		team...
					(more)

				SPHINX (Cont'd)
				(at Furious)
		Not like some drunken Tejano on Saturday night.

Furious grunts.

					SPHINX
		Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil.  
		You will need more than shovels and dessert 
		forks to stop him... What else have you got?

They are silent.

					FURIOUS
				     (angrily)
		So what else has Superman got?

					SHOVELER
		He's got the fact that he's Superman!

					BOWLER
		Bullets bounce off him!

Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.

					RAJA
		Firepower costs money.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Anybody got any?

A silence.

					SHOVELER
		We didn't think this through very well.

					BOWLER
				(after a moment)
		My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

Our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse.  The place is an absolute 
wreck.  It hasn't been painted in twenty-five years. Windows are 
boarded up.  Half the shingles are gone.  There's visible fire damage 
around the kitchen window.

					SHOVELER
		Are you sure he's still lives here?

					RAJA
		Are you sure he's still alive?

					BOWLER
		He was the last time I saw him.

					SHOVELER
		When was that?
	
					BOWLER
		I was eight.

She is about to knock, but the door is suddenly yanked open, and an 
eighty year old guy is standing there.  He's got a wild head of white 
hair (that looks like a living explosion), and he wears a stained old 
lab coat with stickum mtssages to himself stuck to it, non-matching 
slippers, and a pair of thick glasses with frames that have been 
composited of half a dozen different old pairs all taped and welded 
together into a fantastic concoction.  He is DOC HELLER.

					HELLER
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		Doctor Heller?

					HELLER
				(doesn't recognize her)
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		It's me... Elizabeth.

					HELLER
		Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so... 
		middle aged!

					BOWLER
		Thanks.

					HELLER
		How's your dad?

					BOWLER
		He's dead.

					HELLER
		Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of 
		a guy.

Furious throws a look at the Shoveler and Raja.  This guy's out of it.  
They're wasting their time.

					BOWLER
		Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes, 
		and we need your help.

					HELLER
		Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that 
		sort of covers--

					SPHINX
		Doctor, we need your weapons.

					HELLER
				    (ecstatic)
		My weapons? You need my weapons?

EXT.  BEHIND THE HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER - MOVING ANGLE

as Doctor Heller leads them all briskly across his overgrown yard 
toward... the barn.

					HELLER
		The military establishment has never understood 
		me.  They won't return my phone calls, much 
		less field test anything.  But I knew that 
		someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you 
		are!
			   (pulls open the barn door)

INT.  THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

As our heroes step into Heller's laboratory/arsenal.  A stack of small 
aluminum cans lines one wall.  There are weird lookinq sprayers, tubes, 
and strange homemade toy-like devices... but there isn't a firearm in 
sight.

					RAJA
		But, Doc... where's the machine guns?

					SHOVELER
		The bazookas?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The lasers?

					HELLER
		You don't need that junk!  You see, for 
		thousands of years mankind has been immolating, 
		disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why?  
		Because we have this built-in screwed up need 
		to go to war!
					(more)

					HELLER (Cont'd)
		So as a young man I thought, why nat have the 
		fun and excitement of war, without all that 
		unnecessary bloodshed.  That's why I have 
		devoted my life to developing an arsenal of 
		highly sophisticated non-lethal military 
		weapons.
				(points to a hand held tube)
		Air cannons... Blame throwers... Feet seeking 
		missiles... And perhaps my ultimate 
		invention...
	   		   (picks up one of the small cans)
		The canned tornado.

Furious groans, and the others share a look.  This guy's really a nut.

					HELLER
		Now here's a beauty!
			(picks up a purple and orange sprayer
			that looks like a suped up water gun)
		I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after 
		years of studying the worst dry cleaners I 
		could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to 
		half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is 
		immediately immobilized by their own clothing!

					FURIOUS
		Let's get out of here.

Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow. But the 
Bowler picks up a canned tornado.

OUTSIDE THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.

					BOWLER
		Hey, Mister Bad Mood.

Furious stops, turns back.

					BOWLER
			(pulls the ring on the can)
		Catch.

She tosses the can to him.  He catches it--just as a small angry 
tornado FUNNELS out of the can.  It catches Furious and lifts him high 
in the air... then dissipates to nothing...

A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.

ON THE OTHERS, amazed.

Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.  He starts 
back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can. The others get 
out of his way, as, muttering angrily to himself, he goes back into the 
barn...

And emerges a moment later, toting the air cannon.

					HELLER
		He's got the air cannon!

The others think he's going to use it on them and scatter for cover. 
but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target... 
He sees an old abandoned outhouse, puts the air cannon to his shoulder, 
aims, and fires...

There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the 
cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.  But 
the big rush of air hits the shed dead center... and BLOWS IT TO 
PIECES, leaving only the old seat.

Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.

					FURIOUS
		Doc, you're a genius!
				     (hugs him)

					HELLER
		I know.

					FURIOUS
				(turns to the others)
		Okay! We got the firepower!  I say we throw it 
		into the car, drive over to Casanova's house, 
		and kick some ass!

					SPHINX
		No.

The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to 
		fight together... as one thing.

The others nod in agreemnt... while Furious fumes.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - TRAINING AT THE FARM

CLOSE ON DOC HELLER aiming his air cannon... CAMERA PULLS BACK TO 
REVEAL our heroes (minus Furious) standing in a pack right behind him, 
holding him down. HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, 
but it doesn't knock them over...

as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and 
shake their fists... while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, 
drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.

VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team... crawling across 
the grass together....charginq in a line... hurling canned tornadoes... 
while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous 
of the Sphinx.

Shoveler, Bowler, and the Sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder, as 
Invisible Boy, Spleen, Raja, and the Doc throw small stones at them... 
They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... 
Theyre having fun.  They're becoming a team...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE BARN - EVENING

Furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old 
picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a 
great practice.)  Raja explains the history of the situation to the 
Sphinx.

					RAJA
		Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this 
		city were united into one great brotherhood of 
		evil, and Casanova was their king.

					SHOVELER
		Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in 
		your home.

					BOWLER
		Much less go outside.

					SHOVELER
		Then Captain Amazing appeared.

					RAJA
		He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.

					SHOVELER
		And this has been a pretty nice place to live 
		ever since.

					FURIOUS
				    (pissed off)
		But now Casanova's back!  And we're gonna sit 
		around here all night eating pizza and telling 
		stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

					SPHINX
		The wise snake coils before he strikes.

					FURIOUS
				(lunges at the Sphinx)
		And a skunk stinks!

Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.

					SPHINX
		You drink too much.

					FURIOUS
		When are you going to take off that mask?

					SPHINX
				    (pointedly)
		When I am sure I am among friends.

					RAJA
		Roy--

					FURIOUS
				(snapping at him)
		Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

ON THE RAJA, hurt.

					SPHINX
		Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds 
		you to your heart.

					FURIOUS
		My heart died a long time ago.

					SPHINX
		It is not dead.  It is hiding.

					FURIOUS
		Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to 
		hell with the rest of you!... Look at you.  
		Bunch of rejects.  I didn't need you before--
		and I don't need you now!
			(jumps on to his motorcycle)
		The great ones RIDE ALONE!
			(kicks the engine started)
		Adios, muchachos!
			(and he rides off across the field)

ON THE OTHERS, watching him...

					BOWLER
		Has he always been like this?

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

the wind whipping against his face, as he rides his Harley at about a 
hundred miles an hour... The languorous sound of an OLD DEAN MARTIN 
SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

MENORY SEQUENCE - DAY - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as a little boy, sitting in the backseat of the family car. It is 
thirty years ago, and Mister Furious is a sweet, very shy, well 
behaved, perfectly normal three year old.  His MOTHER and FATHER sit in 
the front.  Dean Martin is playing on the car radio.  Little Furious 
looks out the window and sees the Mohave Desert going by.  A sign reads 
"Las Vegas, 120 miles".

					MOTHER
				   (to husband)
		Oh this place looks great.

An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of 
a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.  They park.

					MOTHER
		Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and 
		Daddy will be right beck.

They get out, lock the car and head for the bar, leaving the windows 
up.  Little Furious watches them go, never suspecting that his entire 
life is about to change.  He sits quietly in the backseat and plays 
with the little superhero figurines that he's brought with him.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Pow!  Bang!  Wham!

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

as the parents enter.  A very Western motif.  An old Gene Autrey song 
is playing on the juke.  The air conditioning is on.	They're the only 
customers in the place.

					MOTHER
		It's nice and cool in here.

					FATHER
				(as they sit at the bar)
		Barkeep, a couple of cold ones.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAR AND BAR -

ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...

as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is 
starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.  He looks out 
at the bar. gettinq worried.  He tries the windows, but they're 
automatic and won't open...

Back in the bar his parents down shots of bourbon with their beers, as 
the BARTENDER finishes telling them a joke.

					BARTENDER
		And here's a banana for your monkey.

Mom and Dad have a good laugh.

					BARTENDER
		Couple more?

					FATHER
		You bet.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE TUE CAR as Little Furious, sweat and tears pouring 
out of him, his hair wet and sticking out (and starting to take on that 
familiar look), pounds on the window.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Mommy!  Daddy!  Mommy!  Daddy!

as back in the bar his parents, now very drunk, down more beers and 
chasers as they play a spirited game of pinball.

ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly

barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his 
face a mask of heat and terror... But suddenly, a change begins to take 
place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his 
fear begins to give way to rage... His teeth bare.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS -

as they CRUSH the superhero figurines in their grasp...

While back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to Hank 
Williams "Your Cheatin' Heart"...

EXT.  TBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT - HANK WILLIAMS CONTINUES

as the big desert moon shines down on the family car, still parked 
there.

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

The parents are asleep in a booth.  Furious' mother wakes up, looks 
around groggily, and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers...

					MOTHER
		OH MY GOD!

THE PARKING LOT - A BEAT LATER

as she runs toward the car, hysterical.

					MOTHER
		Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!

She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her 
pull back in horror... Little Furious sits in the backseat.  His hair 
sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of 
prisordial rage.  Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on 
his face; he is still that little boy.  The Dean Martin song is playing 
on the juke.

					MONICA (0.S.)
		Hi.

He looks up and sees Monica.

					FURIOUS
		Hi.

					MONICA
		Alone tonight?

					FURIOUS
		Every night.

She smiles.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Armed Disco Boys guard the front entrance...

While on the hillside above Invisible Boy (looking through binoculars) 
and the Spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds, keeping the 
mansion under surveillance.

					SPLEEN
				  (in a whisper)
		Adolescence was the worst--The other kids made 
		fun of me, so I'd spit on them and they'd 
		scatter--I've never had a girlfriend--unless 
		you count that night with my cousin--She 
		recovered fully though--We exchange cards every 
		Christmas--Well, I send her one, and she sends 
		it back...
			(spritzes somathing into his mouth,
			then offers it to Invisible Boy)
		Bug repellent?

Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans... followed 
by a truck, drive out...

POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -

Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.

					INVISIBLE BOY (0.S.)
		Where are they going?

Invisible Boy hesitates for just a momnt, then gets up and runs down 
the hill.

					SPLEEN
				(runs after him)
		Kid!

As the small convoy drives past, Invisible Boy slips out from behind 
some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper.  
The Spleen comes running after him, and Invisible Boy reaches out, 
grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him.  Invisible Boy tries the 
rear gate.  It's open. The two of them pull it up just a foot, squirm 
inside, then pull it closed behind them.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Invisible Boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the 
inside of the truck.  There is nothing in it, except for a large pile 
of packing blankets.

EXT.  WATERFRONT AREA - NIGHT

as the convoy drives through Champion City's seedy waterfront area and 
out onto a long pier.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE TV

Dawn Wong and Don Stouffer report the night's news.

					DAWN
		...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and 
		now, in an unrelated story, another one of 
		Champion City's leading citizens has apparently 
		disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen 
		or heard from in a week. Authorities believe 
		that the hard working superhero may just be 
		taking a well deserved rest.

					DON
		Cancun perhaps?

					DAWN
		Sounds good to me, Don.

Mr. Furious sits in the booth drinking coffee as Monica serves him his 
burger and fries.

					FURIOUS
				   (floundering)
		Monica... I was wondering if--uh-maybe we--I 
		mean you and I--could-uh--you know--get a--I 
		mean have a...

					MONICA
		Date?

					FURIOUS
		Yeah.

					MONICA
		I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me 
		home?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

					MONICA
		That was easy.
				(goes back to work)

ON FURIOUS, feeling a whole lot better.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - UNKNOWN POV

from across the street.  Furious' head is clearly visible in the 
brightly illuminated window of the diner.

A Disco Boy stands in the shadows, gazing at the diner; he recognizes 
Furious.

EXT.  WATERFRONT - NIGHT

The convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter, docked at the 
pier.

Casanova's men throw the gate of the truck open, and the CAMERA MOVES 
IN.  No one is there, but we notice... two large lumps under the 
packing blankets.

Casanova holds Anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate 
being lowered from the deck of the freighter.

					CASANOVA
		Honey, our ship's come in.

Casanova's cellular phone rings.

OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS

The Disco Boy is on his phone.  His pistol is drawn, and he's got it 
aimed right at Furious' head.

					DISCO BOY
		Just give me the word.

BACK TO THE PIER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
				   (gets an idea)
		Wait.  I'll be right there.
				(hangs up, starts off)

					ANABEL
				     (peeved)
		Where are you going?

					CASANOVA
		Head hunting.

A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of 
the sedans... as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is 
pulled closed... and locked.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A MOMENT LATER

The engine starts up, and the truck starts to move, as Invisible Soy 
and the Spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets... 
They approach the crate and Invisible Boy shines his flashlight on it.  
The crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands; there's no way 
they're going to be able to get inside it, but in the light of the 
flashlight they see...

Faded red lettering, in Russian, and the distinctive old hammer and 
sickle of the former Soviet Union.

EXT.  DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

Furious walks Monica home.

					MONICA
		I admire you.

					FURIOUS
		Why?

					MONICA
		Being a superhero, wanting to save the world.  
		It's so... unselfish.

					FURIOUS
		It is?

					MONICA
		Most people just want to make money or be 
		famous or something.  But you risk everything, 
		just to help people.

					FURIOUS
				(after a moment)
		I wouldn't mind being famous.

					MONICA
		Who wouldn't?

In the shadows behind them... Casanova follows, stalking them, as 
silent as a vampire.

					MONICA
		I've never been able to figure out what to do 
		with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a 
		waitress.

					FURIOUS
		Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

					MONICA
		What's your real name?

					FURIOUS
		Roy.

					MONICA
		Have you always lived here?

He nods.

					MONICA
		Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's 
		noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart.

					FURIOUS
		It's home.

					MONICA
		Yeah.

CASANOVA'S POV

Monica, smiling, looking lovely.

CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...

BACK ON FURIOUS AND MONICA -

					MONICA
		I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or 
		New York, but...

					FURIOUS
		What have they got that we ain't got?

					MONICA
		Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to 
		be here when it does.

					FURIOUS
		Me, too.

					MONICA
		You don't seem very angry right now.

He shrugs.  And they kiss, very tenderly.

					MONICA
		You know what?  Underneath all that anger I 
		think there's just a little boy who wants 
		everyone to love him.

					FURIOUS
		I just want to be a superhero.

					MONICA
		That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes 
inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. He 
really likes her.  He starts walking back down the street, past a man 
sitting on the stoop.  The man looks up.  It's Casanova Frankenstein.

				CASANOVA
		Going my way?

Furious is caught completely by surprise--he takes a stand, ready to 
fight.

				CASANOVA
		Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to 
		have a little chat... That was quite a number 
		you did on my car.  You've got a lot of 
		violence in you... and I like that in a guy.

Furious, silent.

					CASANOVA
		You know what the difference is between good 
		and evil, Roy?

Furious reacts to the fact that Casanova knows his real name.

					CASANOVA
		Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you 
		just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, 
		you kill them... You seem like a very 
		frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled.  
		What is it that you've always wanted, always 
		desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it 
		to you... Fame?
				(snaps his fingers)
		Easy.  Fortune?  Even easier. Women?
					(laughs)
		The easiest of all.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement 
in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.

					CASANOVA
		I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In 
		two days this entire city will belong to me, 
		and there's not a damn thing your little pals 
		can do about it.  It's the perfect time to 
		switch teams... So what do you say?

					FURIOUS
				     (quietly)
		You're nuts.

					CASANOVA
					(flairs)
		They always call the great ones nuts.

					FURIOUS
		And the nuts always call themselves great.

					CASANOVA
				(his psychosis showing)
		Are you with me... or against me?

					FURIOUS
		Against.

					CASANOVA
		Too bad.  PLUG HIM!

Gunfire rings out from the alley as the Disco Bays step out, their 
pistols blazing.  But Furious has anticipated them.  He leaps right at 
Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of 
fire.

					CASANOVA
		WAIT!

The Disco BQys stop firing... Furious drags Casanova back into an empty 
lot, using him as a shield.

					FURIOUS
				   (to Casanova)
		Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.

					CASANOVA
		You're dead.

					FURIOUS
		So are you!

Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden 
wall at the end of the lot... as the Disco Boys open fire again, and 
their bullets punch holes through the wall...

Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that 
we recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.)  
A high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of 
featureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely 
ancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.

ANGLE ON a plaque that reads...  "Frankenstein Center for the 
Performing and Non-performing Arts".

The gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER

Invisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the 
truck pull to a stop...

A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with 
several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.

					ANABEL
		Be careful with my baby.

There are two lumps under the packing blankets again.

EXT.  LOADING DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The crate is being carried away by a forklift... A beat, and then 
Invisible Boy and the Spleen slip out of the empty truck...

And run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open.  
They're just about to pass safely through them, when a PAIR OF ARMED 
SECURITY GUARDS, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.

					GUARD 1
		Freeze!

					GUARD 2
		Hands up!

They freeze, their hands held high.

					GUARD 2
		What are you two doing here?

Our heroes are mute.

					GUARD 1
		Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn 
		around, start walking up the hill--

					GUARD 2
		And no funny business.

Invisible Boy and the Spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the 
hill, the guards right behind them.

					SPLEEN
			(after a moment, to Invisible
				Boy, in a whisper)
		Pinch 'em.

Invisible Boy pinches his nostrils--and the Spleen lets out with a 
horrendous fart.  The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as 
our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.

INT.  DOC KELLER'S LABORATORY/BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Invisible Boy and Spleen report to the others.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.

The others consider this, then hear a familiar voice.

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Is there room in the pack for one more wolf?

They look up and see that Furious has just returned... The Sphinx moves 
to him.  For a moment they stand face to face...

					FURIOUS
		I was wrong... I need my friends.

Sphinx takes off his mask, revealing that he is the busboy from the 
Tacky Taco.

					SPHINX
		Amigo.

They embrace.

A few mimutes later.  The others are gathered around Furious, listening 
to his story.

					FURIOUS
		Casanova said that in two days the entire city 
		would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing 
		that we could do about it.

					BOWLER
		What did he mean?

					FURIOUS
		I dunno.

Through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside, the 
Frankenstein Center silhouetted ominously against it. Raja, Shoveler, 
and Furious gaze at it.

					SHOVELER
		Maybe it's time we checked that place out.

					RAJA
		But how do we get in?

					FURIOUS
		(after a moment, sounding very Sphinx-like)
		We just become like the wolf... who wears the 
		sheep's clothing.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - THE NEXT DAY

CLASSIC DISCO ("Stayin' Alive" if we can get the rights)

Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes) walk down the street 
together and step into the doorway of... the Salvation Army Thrift 
Shop...

Later.  CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and 
vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever")... 
CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown 
seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses), doing their best Travolta 
strut down the street...

MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the 
art center, right past the security guards...

OUTSIDE THE CENTER - DAY

They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... 
then pass through the big wooden doors and into...

INT.  MAIN HALL - A MOMENT LATER

END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall... A 
small army of heavily armed security guards marches about.

					RAJA
		So where's the art?

					FURIOUS
		He hasn't stolen it yet.

					SHOVELER
		This place is built like a fortress.

					FURIOUS
		Because thats what it is.

They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.

					RAJA
		What's that?

					FURIOUS
				(following the sound)
		Come on.

They approach a doorway.  The noise is coming from within.

INT.  BANQUET IIALL - A MOMENT LATER

as our heroes step inside and see... A big luncheon is in progress.  
Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit at the head table. The room is lined 
with banquet tables, which are filled with VICIOUS LOOKING CHARACTERS, 
drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here.

ON A GROUP OF VICIOUS LOOKING BALD BIKER TYPES...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bone Heads from the South Side...

ON THREE INSIPIDLY EVIL LOOKING GUYS in hip suits...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bland Boys from Downtown...

ON A DARK HAIRED WHITE GUY dressed as a rapper...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		Italian Ice...

ON A GUY with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his 
face...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Stapler...

ON TWO THUGS DRESSED AS ELVIS...

					RAJA (0.S.)
		The Elvis Brothers.

A more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. Furious 
recognizes one of the waitresses...   It's Monica.

Casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night 
before on the street with Furious.

ON ANABEL, noticing his interest.

Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them. They turn away, 
lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous...

But as she passes them, not noticing them... Casanova approaches her.

					CASANOVA
		Excuse me.

She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet 
away...

					CASANOVA
				(reading her name tag)
		Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I 
		couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead 
		ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

					MONICA
		Really?

Furious growls.  Raja gives him an elbow.

					CASANOVA
		Are you an actress?

					MONICA
		Just a waitress.

					CASANOVA
		You underestimate yourself.

Mister Furious is fuming.  The strands of his perfectly coiffed disco-
do start to stand straight up.

					CASANOVA
		You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little 
		Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I 
		think you'd be perfect for.

					MONICA
		Really?

					CASANOVA
		I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick 
		around after the luncheon?

					MONICA
		Sure--I guess.

					CASANOVA
		Terrific.

She turns and walks into the kitchen.

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, watching her; his intentions are sinister...  He 
turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.

					CASANOVA
		What are you three doing here? This is invited 
		guests only.  Out.

Our heroes skulk out.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief.

					RAJA
		That was too close.

					SHOVELER
		But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

					FURIOUS
		Hey.

Furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be 
wheeled into the hall.

BACK IN THE BANQUET HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a CLOSER ANGLE, under the 
table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along...

A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table... Suddenly, 
she is yanked under.

UNDER THE TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over 
her mouth.

					FURIOUS
		It's me.

She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.

					MONICA
		What are you guys doing here?

				  RAJA & SHOVELER
		Shhhh!

The waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung 
closed, and the cigars are lit.  The meeting has begun. Casanova takes 
the podium.

					CASANOVA
		Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the 
		cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get 
		them.

Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with 
the rest of the crowd.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I 
		WAS YOUR KING!

ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad 
old story.

					CASANOVA
				    (tragically)
		But they called me a psycho, and they put me 
		away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell, 
		painting watercolors, writing haikus--just 
		waiting for the day I could take my revenge.  
		Well, brothers, that day has come!

ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening.  Monica begins to realize 
what's going on.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
		They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on 
		them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on 
		the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest--
		every man, woman, and child in this city is 
		going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers 
		will murder their tots!  Old ladies will 
		strangle their cats!  Children will bump off 
		their babysitters!

The guests think Casanova's completely lost it.  Italian Ice speaks up.

					ITALIAN ICE
		You're outta your mind!

					CASANOVA
		I beg your pardon?

					ITALIAN ICE
		Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.

					CASANOVA
		Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly 
		little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow 
		my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours.

Now the hoods' interest has been perked.

					ITALIAN ICE
		Done.

					CASANOVA
			(to Anabel, with a smile)
		Honey, give the boys a taste.

Anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors, 
then presses a button on a small remote control device.

ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly 
filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between 
the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and 
everyone in the room (except Anabel) goes COMPLETELY BERSERK...

CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, 
gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...

Under the serving table our heroes go crazy...

Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and 
empties it into Italian Ice... who drops to the floor, dead.

Anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and 
everything returns to normal.  The entire event lasted only a few 
seconds, but the guests are dazzled.

					CROOKS
		That was great!... What the hell was that?... 
		How did you do that?

Casanova throws Anabel a kiss.

					CASANOVA
		Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be 
		amplified across this entire city.  Murder and 
		mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City 
		will be ours again!  This will be our castle!  
		And I will be our king!  And there's no one to 
		stop us!

Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Not so fast, Casanova!

A pair of curtains suddenly part... and Captain Amazing (looking a bit 
singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose.

CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to 
terror.  They yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table, 
throw up their hands in surrender, etc... But Casanova just grins.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, fellas...
			(moves to Captain Amazing, and
		puts his arm chummily around him)
		I killed him... and I've had him stuffed.

Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like 
the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).

					AMAZING
				(in a canned voice)
		Isn't my butt cute in these tights?
				   (pulls again)
		Blue is my color.
				   (pulls again)
		Oh, my abs are killing me!

The crooks are beside themselves with laughter.

ON OUR HEROES, under the table, stunned.

ON THE ELVIS BROTHERS -

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		The King is back!

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Long live the King!

The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music 
fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...

And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their 
escape...

INT.  DOC HELLER'S BARN/LAB - LATER

Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

					MONICA
		What could have made such a horrible noise?

					HELLER
			  (after a moment, gravely)
		He's got the Psychostridulator.

					ALL
		The what?

					HELLER
		Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret 
		Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a 
		prototype for a weapon that emitted a 
		fluctuating alternative frequency noise that 
		produced a violent psychotic reaction in any 
		mammal within hearing distance.  But when the 
		old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its 
		brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.

					SHOVELER
		This Kopov, what happened to him?

					HELLER
		Not him... her.

They react to that piece of news, and then the Bowler opens up the 
newspaper.

					BOWLER
		Did she look like that?

CLOSE ON A PHOTO of Anabel and Casanova, announcing their wedding 
engagement.

					HELLER
		Yes.

Silence; this is bad.

					SPLEEN
				    (hopefully)
		Maybe it won't work.

					FURIOUS
		It works.

					HELLER
		A village in Siberia was wiped out when a 
		cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.

Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.  
For the first time, they're really scared.

					MONICA
		We've got to warn the city.

					SHOVELER
		How?

					RAJA
		No one will believe us.

					BOWLER
		They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

CAMERA CUTS BETWEEN THEM as they look at each other--their frightened 
faces, their sad, faded costuznes.  Even the Sphinx looks scared.

					FURIOUS
			   (after a moment, grimly)
		We know what we gotta do.

They look at him.

					RAJA
		We're outnumbered twenty to one.

					SHOVELER
		It's suicide.

					FURIOUS
		Maybe.  But this isn't about living or dying.  
		It's about good versus evil, and we're good, 
		whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a 
		little funny...

ON THE SPLEEN...

					FURIOUS
		And smell a little funny.  We're not 
		bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're 
		superheroes--and that means doing what's right-
		-even when it's impossible... This is our city-
		-these are our friends, our famlies--and if we 
		don't save them, nobody will!  So I say we take 
		a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, 
		destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach 
		those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

					SPHINX
		Now you're talking.

					BOWLER
		Sounds good to me.

					RAJA
		Let's do it.

					SHOVELER
		And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!

They're all with him.  Monica steps forward.

					MONICA
		I just want you guys to know--I may not be a 
		superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to 
		help!

					ALL
		Oh that's great... Thanks, Monica...  (Etc.)

					BOWLER
		We could really use some coffee--

					SHOVELER
		And some sandwiches--

					SPLEEN
		With mustard!

					MONICA
			(her feelings a little hurt)
		Sure.

A few minutes later, Monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes 
plan...

					RAJA
		But that place is huge and we don't know where 
		this psycho thing is--

					BOWLER
		Or even what it looks like.

					HELLER
		And he must have it well hidden.

					FURIOUS
		We'll just have to get lucky.

ON MONICA as she gets an idea.  A moment later she slips a canned 
tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each 
other in a group huddle\embrace.

					FURIOUS
		Go do what you gotta do.  We'll meet back here 
		at sunset... Do or die.

					ALL
		Do or die.

					SPHINX
		Victoria o morte.

HEROIC MUSIC as...

EXT.  AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE ON

THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious 
hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck... A moment 
later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps 
out of her office, pissed off...

					SALLY
		HEY!

EXT.  HELLER'S FARM - DAY

ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue... as a 
falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him... In a flash, his 
machete slices through the air, and the leaf continues fluttering down, 
but in two pieces...

INT.  LABORATORY/BARN - DAY

Doc Heller fine tunes his Shrinker spray... as the Bowler sits quietly 
in the hayloft, studying the old dog eared photo of her father and 
herself as a little girl...

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Invisible Boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating 
for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...  He suddenly pops 
opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror... but he's still 
completely visible. He flops onto his bed in frustration.

INT.  THE DINER - DAY

CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food... Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili... 
CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth, 
stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.

INT.  THE SHOVELER'S HOUSE - DAY

The Shoveler, standing in his bedroom, has just put on his freshly 
laundered suit.  CAMERA OPENS WIDE TO REVEAL Lucille, his wife, 
standing there, holding his just polished shovel. He takes it from her, 
then takes her in his arms.

					SHOVELER
		Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a 
		normal guy.

					LUCILLE
		I don't want a normal guy.

And they kiss.

A few minutes later... In the living room the Shoveler's kids lie 
sprawled in front of the television.  The Shoveler, in battle array, 
steps into the room.  Be wants to say something to them, but the kids 
don't even take their eyes off the TV look at him... He turns and walks 
out in silence.

END MUSIC...

INT.  THE RAJA'S DINING ROOM - DAY

The shades are drawn.  The Raja, in full costume, quietly loads 
silverware into the secret pockets of his cape. Suddenly, the light 
switches on... It's his mother.  She's caught him red handed.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!

					RAJA
		Mother... it's not what you think!

					MOTHER
		And why are you wearing that silly costume?

					RAJA
				   (painfully)
		Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

ON HIS MOTHER, shocked.

					RAJA
		Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you 
		wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a 
		family--but it's just not who I am!

					MOTHER
		But... the silverware?

					RAJA
		I use it... to fight evil.

					MOTHER
				(after a moment)
		Jeffrey... this is wonderful.

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		It is?

					MOTHER
		I always knew that you were special.

					RAJA
		You did?

					MOTHER
		Ever since you were a little boy...
			(gets an idea, excited)
		Come with me.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

She pulls down the stairway to the attic...

INT.  THE ATTIC - A MOMENT LATER

She switches on the light and leads the Raja to a far corner...  where 
she moves a couple of old hat boxes, REVEALING an ancient leather bound 
box with the word "Excalibur" engraved in gold on the top.

					MOTHER
		This is for you.

The Raja opens the box and registers astonisha~nt as he sees...

A FABULOUS VICTORIAN SILVER SET packed with formidable looking servers, 
cake knives, ice cream forks.

					MOTHER
		Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver.

The Raja lifts up and handles a large heavily engraved pie server.

					RAJA
		Bitchin'.

EXT.  OUTSIDE HELLER'S BARN/LAB - EVENING - CLOSE ON

Mister Furious, wrench in hand, covered with grease and oil, cussing to 
himself as he works under the hood of the Herkimer.

					FURIOUS
		Try it again!

Invisible Boy, sitting behind the wheel, tries the ignition of the 
Herkimer, and the old engine grinds as it turns over, but doesn't 
catch.

					FURIOUS
		Come on, baby... Come on, baby... I SAID COME 
		ON!

Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and 
backfires into life... shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but 
running... Furious kisses the Herkimer... as the Bowler calls out to 
him from the barn.

					BOWLER
		Mon Capitan, it's for you.
				(tosses him the phone)

					FURIOUS
		Hello?

EXT.  UNKNOWN LOCATION - EVENING - CLOSE ON MONICA

					MONICA
			(on a phone, speaking very softly)
		It's me.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

					FURIOUS
		Monica, where are you?

BACK TO MONICA - WIDER ANGLE

REVEALING that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center.  
She's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed 
for a date.  Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all 
around her.

					MONICA
		At the Frankenstein Center.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM -

					FURIOUS
		Are you nuts?  Get out of there!

					MONICA
		I'm going inside.

					FURIOUS
		What are you talking about?

					MONICA
		Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but 
		he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just 
		maybe--I can trick him into showing me the 
		location of the whatchamathing.

					FURIOUS
		He's a psycho!  He'll kill you!

					MONICA
		Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack 
		as long as you can.  If I can discover the 
		location I'll call you--

					FURIOUS
		And what if you get killed?

					MONICA
		Then at least I will have died trying, right?

Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.

					MONICA
		Roy... We might never see each other again, so 
		I'd better tell you now...  I think you're 
		wonderful.

					FURIOUS
			(caught completely off guard)
		What?

					MONICA
		Bye.
				(and she hangs up)

					FURIOUS
		Monica!

INT.  LOBBY OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as Monica approaches a GUARD standing by the main door.

					MONICA
		Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is 
		here?

					GUARD
		Sure, doll.

BACK TO THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.  He seems 
speechless, dazed.  Something inside him has changed.

					BOWLER
				(worried about him)
		Hey... you okay?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Casanova steps out and sees... Monica, looking very sexy.

					MONICA
		Hi.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you'd chickened out on me.

					MONICA
		Just wanted to... powder my nose.

His eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she 
looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.

					MONICA
		How 'bout giving me "the tour"?

					CASANOVA
		Why not?

EXT.  COURTYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as Casanova leads Monica across an open courtyard toward... the sheer 
walls of the imposing central tower.

					CASANOVA
		Big, isn't it?

He leads her to a massive archway, the only apparent entrance to the 
tower.  But just as she is about to pass through, Monica looks up and 
sees something that makes her pull back with fear...

HER POV -

A very sinister looking SECURITY EYE gazes down at her from the top of 
the archway.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry.  It's not activated.

They pass through and into...

INT.  ROOM IN THE BASE OF TOWER - CONTINUOUS

which is filled with IMMENSE BRONZE SCULPTURES of voluptuous, scantily 
clad females in various poses of bondage.  Monica reacts; these things 
are scary.

					MONICA
		Who's the artist?

					CASANOVA
		Me.

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - NIGHT

The Bowler, Spleen, Invisible Boy, and Doc Heller load up the Herkimer 
with Heller's weaponry...

as Mister Furious lies sprawled on the hillside... breathing in the 
night air, contemplating a dandelion gone to seed, and listening to the 
sounds of the night.  The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby, 
watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.  A whippoorwill 
is heard singing.

					FURIOUS
		Listen.  He's lonely... and he doesn't care who 
		knows it.

Raja and Shoveler share a bewildered look.  The bird sings again.

					FURIOUS
		We're all the same really.  Our songs, our 
		dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt 
		to live forever.
			(blows the dandelion seeds into the wind)

					SPHINX
		He is in love.  His anger is gone.

					RAJA
		Oh no.

					SHOVELER
		Great timing!
	
					FURIOUS
		Has Monica called?

INT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova leads Monica into... a palatial room, filled with priceless 
objects d'art, all of which reflect Casanova's dark psyche.  A Munch 
painting.  Mayan idols.  Weird German furniture.  A huge glass 
chandelier hovers over the room.  A massive bronze sculpture of a wolf 
(done in the same style as the other sculptures) is perched in the 
balcony.  It seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a 
spectacular view, spread out alonq the lakeshore below.

					CASANOVA
		This is where I come to... be alone.

He turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to 
the room.

CLOSE ON MONICA, sensing her danger.

					MONICA
		Oh, look at that view.

She moves out onto the balcony... as Casanova slips the gold chain from 
around his neck and follows her.

INT.  BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes have gathered around Furious, who sits in a chair, getting 
the third degree.

					HELLER
		Snap out of it!

					BOWLER
		Get on to yourself!

					SHOVELER
			(shouting right in his face)
		GET MAD!

					FURIOUS
		But I just don't feel it.

					RAJA
		He's turned into a completely normal person!

					FURIOUS
		Normal.  What's normal?  Does normal exist?  
		And if it did, how would we know it?

The Shoveler slugs him, sending him sprawling.

					FURIOUS
		You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled for.

EXT.  BALCONY ON FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - ON MONICA

gazing out onto the city, as she senses Casanova slinking up behind 
her.

					MONICA
		I'm chilly.

She turns, elegantly avoiding him, and moving back inside.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.

					SPLEEN
		Look!  Your favorite sunglasses!
				(snaps them in two)

					BOWLER
		Your Roy Rogers coffee mug!
			(hurls it against the wall)

					SHOVELER
		Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
			    (breaks the head off it)

					FURIOUS
		Okay, you win.  I'm pissed off. I'm seriously 
		peeved.

The others groan with frustration.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica moves nervously around the room as Casanova sprawls languorously 
on the bed, toying with his gold chain.

					CASANOVA
		Come here.

					MONICA
		I'm not that kind of girl.

					CASANOVA
		Then why are you here?

					MONICA
		Curiosity.

					CASANOVA
				   (with a smile)
		Remember the cat.

Suddenly, he hears high heels in the hall.  A key is put in the lock--
Casanova leaps off the bed, grabs Monica and roughly shoves her into 
the closet.  He leaps back onto the bed, just as the door opens, and 
Anabel, dressed in a lab coat (and wearing high heels) enters.  
Casanova is completely relaxed, nonchalant.

					ANABEL
		What are you doing all alone in the dark?

					CASANOVA
		Fantasizing... about you.

She crosses the room to the wolf sculpture.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you were done?

					ANABEL
		One last tweak.

She opens a secret panel on its back, REVEALNG a FLASHING HIGH TECH 
INTERIOR... and Monica, watching from the closet, realizes that she has 
found the Psychostridulator.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON

a boom box... A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...

					RAJA
		If this doesn't do it, nothing will!

ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.  The music is so loud 
that we can hear it even though it's being played only through the 
headphones.

ON THE OTHERS, gathered around him, waiting to see if this will work.  
And then Furious begins to respond... as his face turns into a 
contorted grimace.

					BOWLER
		It's working!

Furious groans and writhes... The others are thrilled; they've done it!

					FURIOUS
		This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!

He starts to weep.  The others give a collective groan of defeat.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - COHTINUOUS

as Anabel works on the Psychostridulator, Monica looks at a clock... 
which reads almost eleven.  Time is running out.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CLOSE ON SHOVELER'S WRISTWATCH

which also reads eleven.

0N SHOVELER AND RAJA -

					SHOVELER
		It's time.

					RAJA
		With or without him, we gotta go!

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER -

as Anabel closes up the wolf... and starts to leave.

					ANABEL
		Our guests are waiting.

					CASANOVA
		I'll be down in a jiffy.

She goes out.  Casanova listens as the sound of high heels fades away, 
then he goes to the closet and lets Monica out.

					MONICA
		I'd better go.

					CASANOVA
		You're a spy.

					MONICA
				    (offguard)
		What?

					CASANOVA
		I saw him walk you home.

					MONICA
		Who?

					CASANOVA
		Roy.

She makes a sudden try for the door, but he blocks her way, a cold look 
in his eye that makes her step back in fear.

					CASANOVA
		Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady...

He lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand, then starts coming for 
her, a sadistic grin on his face.  This is the real Casanova.

Monica pulls back, then reaches into her purse and takes out A CANNED 
TORNADO, which she holds out threateningly.

					MONICA
		Stay away!

					CASANOVA
		Or you'll what?  CAN ME?

He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL 
OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the 
room... Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the 
door.

ON CASANOVA, pulling himself together.

					CASANOVA
		That bitch!

INT.  CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

as Monica runs for it, dialing the phone on the fly...

INT.  TEE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - ON THE PUONE

ringing... but no one is there...

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are climbing into the Herkimar, whose noisy idling engine 
obliterates the ringing of the phone.

					FURIOUS
		But she still might call!

					SHOVELER
		Are you coming or not?

					FURIOUS
		I'll drive.

					SHOVELER
		Not a chance!

He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON MONICA

hiding behind a large planter... listening to the phone ringing on the 
other end.

					MONICA
		Come on, guys... Pick up... 

Suddenly, we hear Casanova's voice on the line.

				CASANOVA'S VOICE
		What's the matter...

BACK IN THE TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is listening in on another phone.

					CASANOVA
		Nobody home?

BACK TO M0NICA - CONTINUOUS

as she moves quickly down the hall.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is at the wheel.  The Raja sits in the passenger seat.  
The others are in the back.

					SHOVELER
		Here we go!

He forces the stick into gear and the Herkimer lurches forward.

					SHOVELER
		We've got lift off!

					RAJA
		May the forks be with us!

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer--backfiring, smoking, clanging--rumbles down the 
driveway into action.

BACK IN THE HERKINER - CONTINUOUS

Shoveler tries to put the car in second gear, but it won't go. He yanks 
and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.

					RAJA
		First is good.

INT.  CORRIDOR IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova instructs three security guards.

					CASANOVA
		I want her alive.

					GUARDS
		Yes, Mr. Frankenstein.

CAMERA PANS UP the top of a staircase... where Monica is crouched, 
listening.

EXT.  STREETS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS as the Herkimer rumbles and smokes down Champion's main 
street (in first gear) and the citizens step out of houses and bars to 
watch this bizarre sight.

ON A LITTLE BOY AND HIS FATHER -

					LITTLE BOY
		Daddy, what is that thing?

					FATHER
		I don't know, son.

A couple of GRIZZLED CHARACTERS stand in front of a bar.

					DRUNK
		A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.

					SPHINX
		Amigo, we need you.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Just GET MAD!

Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.

INT.  V.I.P. LOUNGE IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

A sumptuous, hotel-like lounge.  Anabel is holding court with all of 
top crooks from the luncheon, charrning the pants off them... Casanova 
slithers up behind her.

					CASANOVA
		Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have 
		gone sane.
				(kisses her neck)

EXT.  FRONT GATE OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the Spleen) 
are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the 
hill straight for them.

					GUARD 1
		What the hell is that?

					GUARD 2
		Looks like... a Ford Dumpster.

They have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to 
stop...  But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates 
and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.

					GUARDS
		HEY!

They open fire.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Bullets are heard pinging off the Herk as THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD just 
ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art 
center.

					SHOVELER
		Hang on!

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and 
starts bouncing up them...

BACK AT THE LOUNGE - ON CASANOVA

checking his watch.

					CASANOVA
		It's showtime.

But then they all hear... the sound of gunfire.

					TONY P
		What's that?

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer chugs and bounces... toward the entrance of the center.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes get bounced all over the place.

INT.  JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as guards close and bolt the big wooden doors to the art center.

ON A GUARD wearing a headset.

					GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, we're being attacked.

INT.  SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova sits at a security console.  Anabel, Tony P, and the top 
crooks stand behind him, listening.

					CASANOVA
		By whom?

					VOICE OF GUARD
		We don't know!

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer climbs to the top, then rams into the doors with a 
thud.  But the doors hold.

BACK ON THE VILLAINS -

					TONY P
		They'll never get through those doors.

BACK AT THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

But the plucky little Herkimer digs in its rear wheels and pushes 
against the doors like the Little Engine That Could...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes encourage the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Come on, baby!

					BOWLER
		Do it, big boy!

ON ITS WHEELS, grinding, chewing up the concrete... 

JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer comes crunching through the big wooden doors of the 
center, scattering the guards.

BACK INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

our heroes cheer, pat the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Atta, girl!

					BOWLER
		Atta, boy!

BACK TO CASANOVA -

watching on a security monitor

					VOICE OF GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, they're in!

					CASANOVA
		Well kill them.

BACK IN THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

The Herkimer drives into the main hall of the center as a small army of 
security guards swarms in, guns blazing.

BACK AT THE SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and the crooks watch the security monitor...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as 
our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on 
his mask... the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air 
cannon... Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes... 
While Mister Furious watches anxiously.

The Shoveler drives intently, bullets splattering like bugs on the 
windshield.

					SHOVELER
		Where am I going?

					RAJA
			(pointing to an archway on the
				other side of the hall)
		Through there!

					SHOVELER
		Right.

But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long 
groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE HERIKINER - CONTINUOUS

Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.  
More guards arrive and open fire... An armored golf cart with a fifty 
caliber machine gun mounted on it comes speeding into the hall, 
blasting the Herk...

Inside, the sound of the big bullets is deafening as Shoveler tries to 
restart the engine.

					SHOVELER
		No good!  She's dead!

ON CASANOVA AND THE CROOKS, watching the monitor and laughing as 
bullets pulverize the Herk.

					TONY P
		Spam in a can!

The crooks laugh.

Butsuddenly, the Herkimer's door is thrown open, revealing our heroes--
holding down Doc Heller, his air cannon at the ready. He fires--there 
is a WHOOMPH of air--and the mounted gun and a dozen guards are sent 
tumbling...

SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA AND THE OTHERS

watching, sobered.

BACK IN THE MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes come charging out of the Herkimer, using their various 
skills to blow through the surprised guards.  Mr. Furious comes out 
last, not quite sure what to do with himself.

But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid 
down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony 
overlooking the floor.  Bullets splatter all around them--and several 
unlucky guards are hit--but our heroes dive for cover. The Raja tries 
to get off a fork, but the firing is too intense.  Our heroes are 
pinned down.

ON MR. FURIOUS as he sees... the bag of canned tornadoes. He's got no 
superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.

					FURIOUS
		Cover me!

					SHOVELER
		With what?

Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but 
impressive) zig-zag pattern across the floor... He performs a wild 
somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a 
perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony.  The tornado 
funnels out, and the guards are sent flying.

ON CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS watching...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
		Who are those guys?

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, who knows who they are.

WHILE BACK IN THE HALL our heroes rally around a shaken Mr. Furious.

					RAJA
		Not bad for a normal guy!

					SPHINX
		Amigos!

					ALL
		Do or die!

EXT.  COURTYARD - A MOMENT LATER - ANGLE ON

the security eye watching...

as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

as he types something into the security computer...

ON THE SCREEN a computerized image of the eye appears. Casanova 
highlights the word "Activate" and then presses "Enter".

BACK TO THE COURTYARD - ON THE EYE

as it comes to glowing, sinister life...

A hapless guard retreats under the arch--the Eye instantly focuses on 
him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that SIZZLE 
HIM...

A moment later our heroes arrive at the arch.  Furious is about to run 
through, but Doc Heller holds him back.

					HELLER
		Wait!  Look!

He points to... a man shaped pile of charcoal, all that remains of the 
unfortunate guard.

					HELLER
		Laser eye... and it's a humdinger.

					RAJA
		No problem.

The Raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the 
eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into... 
a formless blob of silver.

BACK TO CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS -

					TONY P
		We'll take care of these clowns.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Piece a cake.

					BONE HEAD LEADER
		No sweat.

CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

as Tony P, the top crooks, and the Disco Boys march en masse TOWARD THE 
CAMAERA... They are an ugly, formidable looking bunch.

EXT.  COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are blocked by the eye.

					SHOVELER
		Doc, there's got to be a way.

But the Doc is stymied... Suddenly they hear a woman's voice calling 
down to them.

					MONICA'S VOICE
		It's up here!  It's up here!

					FURIOUS
				     (looks up)
		Monica!

EXT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica leans over the edge of the balcony, the wolf sculpture looming 
over her, shouting down at them.

					MONICA
		ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--!

But strong hands suddenly grab her.  It's Casanova.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as high above he hears Monica scream.

BACK TO THE BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down 
tauntingly to Furious.

					CASANOVA
		Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have 
		her back... when I'm done!

BACK T0 FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.  He is desperate 
to find a way up, but the wall is completely sheer. He feels helpless-
frantic, near tears...

FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' 
car, crying, pounding on the windows...

And then... Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up--
and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. His button has 
finally been pressed.  Be's MAD!  He reaches up as high as he can...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND -

as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he 
pulls himself up.

BACK AT THE TOP 0F THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova throws Monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and 
strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength.

BACK TO FURIOUS -

Fifty feet up and climbing.  He pulls himself up, one hand, then 
another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny 
cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.

					HELLER
		He'll never make it.

					BOWLER
		Think positive.

Meanwhile, Invisible Boy stands staring at the security eye, a look of 
fierce determination on his face.  This is his moment.

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(to himself)
		I can do it.

He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates...

ON FURIOUS as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold 
gives way... For a desperate moment, Furious is dangling off the wall 
by the tips of the fingers of one hand. Only his incredible rage keeps 
his fingertips taut.

Suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in 
the concrete not far from his head.  Furious grabs hold of it, and 
throws a grateful look down to the Raja...

Who salaams up at him...

As Invisible Boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly, 
hands at his sides, in an almost Egyptian pose... toward the eye... 
which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim...

we notice that Invisible Boy has become... just slightly transparent.

AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles Monica.  Her resistance 
fades.  Her hands fall away.  She is pale, beautiful, almost gone, a 
picture of exquisite death.

					CASANOVA
				   (admiring her)
		Some girls just know how to die.

Suddenly, we hear someone cursing Casanova in Russian. He turns and 
sees... Anabel standing there, pistol in hand.

					ANABEL
		You two timing psychotic bastard.

					CASANOVA
		Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

					ANABEL
				(aiming at his heart)
		Do I?

					CASANOVA
		I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women.  
		It doesn't mean a thing.
				(moving toward her, turning on
				that old Frankenstein Charm)
		Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our 
		night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated 
		for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a 
		trifle... You're the only woman who's ever 
		meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship 
		you.  I want to make you my bride.

She succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her 
hand.

					CASANOVA
		There's just one thing...
				(with a psychotic smile)
		I don't need you anymore.

A look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his 
eyes.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady.

EXT.  ON THE WALL - A MOMENT LATER - ON FURIOUS

still climbing as he hears a scream, looks up... and sees Anabel go 
plummeting past him.

ON OUR HEROES down below.

					BOWLER
		Heads up!

CAMERA HOLDS ON OUR HEROES, wincing as Anabel hits with an ugly thud.

Suddenly they hear Invisible Boy calling to them.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible!

They all turn and see... Invisible Boy, totally visible, but standing 
on the other side of the arch.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Can you see me?

					ALL
		Yes!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Nuts.

					SHOVELER
		Kid, turn that thing off!

Invisible Boy turns and sees... a computer screen built into the wall 
(with the same image of the eye on it that was on Casanova's computer), 
but he doesn't have a clue how to turn it off.  Suddenly, he hears 
running feet, turns and sees...

The top crooks and the Disco Boys rushing towards him through the giant 
sculptures.  He gets an idea... and stands right in front of the 
computer screen.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		HEY! CREEPS!

He makes a face at them--and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him.  
He jumps clear behind a pillar--as the bullets smash into the wall... 
one of them demolishing the computer screen.

CLOSE ON THE EYE -

as it goes dead.

ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar... realizing he's been shot 
in the shoulder.

BACK ON OUR HEROES -

					SHOVELER
		This is it!  DO OR DIE!

The villains form a line, bristling with pistols... as our heroes, led 
by Sphinx, Shoveler, and Bowler come running through the arch.  The 
threesome go shoulder to shoulder (with our other heroes right behind 
them) as the villains open fire, laying down a deadly fusillade...

ON SHOVELER, BOWLER, AND SPHINX, standing together, deflecting their 
bullets with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... (as they practiced 
with pebbles at the farm)... with the Raja right behind them, hurling 
silverware...

ON THE VILLAINS, rapid firing... but their own bullets ricochet back 
into them, dropping them... They start to fall back.

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is about to finish Monica.

					CASANOVA
		And the light goes out...

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Frankenstein!

Casanova turns and sees... Furious, standing on the balcony.

					CASANOVA
		Roy... What took you so long?

Furious starts at Casanova, who aims Anabel's pistol at him. Furious 
hesitates.

					CASANOVA
		Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.

					FURIOUS
		They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs 
the gun out of his hand.  Casanova ducks clear.  Furious tosses the 
pistol away... then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.

					CASANOVA
		Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?

He turns on his stereo and the sound of DISCO MUSIC fills the air...

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

Downstairs, the villains have regrouped.

					TONY P
		Let's rush 'em!

They charge en mass at our heroes... who are waiting for them... 
pinching their noses closed, the Spleen bent over at their forefront...

While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting 
the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly 
sidesteps him...

The crooks and Disco Boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious 
fumes...

As Casanova attacks...

Advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield 
machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the 
villains back...

Casanova comes at Furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning...  and 
Furious gets the worst of it.

Suddenly, a squad of Disco Boys comes charging at our heroes from the 
flank... but Doc Heller turns to face them, shrinker spray held Rambo-
style on his hip.  He lets them have it, blasting them with a DENSE 
BLUE SPRAY...

When the spray clears, the D Boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners 
in their now child sized disco suits...

					DISCO BOYS
		Help!... Get me out of this!
				        (Etc.)

Upstairs, Casanova pummels Furious...

While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some 
nifty shovel work... But suddenly, the Bland Boys, pistols blazing, are 
advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture.  
But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.

					RAJA (0.S.)
		Gentlemen!

The Bland Boys look up and see... the Raja, both hands filled with 
silverware... which he HURLS...

A beat later the Bland Boys, bristling with forks and grapefruit 
spoons, run screaming through the sculptures... as Tony P, pistol in 
hand, skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots... the Bowler.

Upstairs, Furious goes flying against a wall...

					CASANOVA
		Roy, you're making this too easy.

As Tony P takes a careful bead on the Bowler.

					TONY P
		Say hello to Daddy for me!

He opens fire, but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy... 
He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun 
clicks empty.  She turns and faces him.

					BOWLER
				     (grimly)
		Daddy says hello.

She HURLS the ball at him--like a fiery softball pitch.

BALL'S POV -

going straight for Tony P's SCREAMING head...

ON THE BOWLER, watching--as Tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose 
thud.

Back upstairs Casanova cornmes at Furious again... but Furious ducks 
the kick, pops back up and smashes Casanova with his good arm... 
sending him flying across the room... Casanova recovers.

					CASANOVA
		Let's change the tune.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device (that Anabel 
used at the luncheon).  He presses a button...

ON THE WOLF SCULPTURE as the jaws open, its eyes glow red... and the 
dreadful sound of the Psychostridulator grinds up and FILLS THE NIGHT 
AIR LIKE A SIREN.

Downstairs, the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the 
villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode... The villains 
start shooting and stabbing each other.

SERIES OF SHOTS - AROUND THE CITY - CONTINUOUS

On Main Street cars slam into each other.  Pedestrians start screaming 
and fightinq... A man and his dog snarl and snap at each other...

The Customers at the Lakeside Diner go insane, hurling plates and 
food...

At the Shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the 
television...

ANGLE ON A TYPICAL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -

as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be 
heard coming from all the houses...

LONG ANGLE OF CHAMPION CITY -

as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

in full psychotic ecstasy...

					CASANOVA
		WHAT A RUSH!
			(tosses the remote off the balcony)

ON MONICA, still motionless on the bed...

Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a 
contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... Casanova gets 
his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it... Furious drops to 
his knees, and Casanova thinks he's got him.  But Furious, grimacing 
with rage, looks him right in the eye.

					FURIOUS
				   (raspy voiced)
		Is... that... all you got?

Furious grabs Casanova's wrists... and crushes them.  Casanova howls 
with pain, loses his grip.  Furious slugs him, again and again... then 
he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into 
the air...

Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an 
explosion of crystal and glass.  Furious averts his eyes as cut glass 
rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees...

Casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier.  
Casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own 
gold chain...

Furious moves to the wolf sculpture.  Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its 
bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a 
flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but 
higher pitched and more irritating sound...

Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a 
thousand pieces...

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE PIECES -

In insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more 
disorienting sound.  This is the very nerve center of the 
Psychostridulator...

Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...

SILENCE...

Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... He looks up... at 
Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...

					FURIOUS
		Nice dancing with you.

SERIES OF SHOTS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished 
crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it. Things also 
return to normal...

On the street...

At the Lakeside Diner...

And at the Shoveler's house...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Furious moves to the bed, where Monica lies motionless and pale...

					FURIOUS
		Monica...

He touches her face, her eyes open, and she looks at him.

					MONICA
		You're beautiful when you're angry.

He takes her tenderly in his arm... as the Raja, the Shoveler and the 
others rush into the room and see... Furious and Monica embracing.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A LITTLE LATER

Police cars and news vans arrive... as our heroes, battered, wounded, 
but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs...

Furious and Monica hold each other up.  Wounded Invisible Boy has his 
arm around the Spleen... while policemen and news people run up the 
stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...

But this time our heroes could care less.  They are superheroes, and 
they don't give a damn who knows it.

INT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

as the Raja opens the door and enters...

					RAJA
		Mama!

She is there, waiting up for him.

					RAJA
		I'm home.

They embrace.

INT. SHOVELER'S DOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

Don Stouffer is reporting.

					DON
		Few details have emerged...

ON THE SHOVELER'S KIDS, on the couch, still rattled by their psychotic 
episode, glued to the TV -

					DON (0.S.)
		...but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive 
		interview vith two of the suspects.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong interviews the battered, handcuffed Elvis Brothers as they 
are led away...

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		I don't know who those guys were--but I never 
		want to see 'em again.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Especially that big dude with the shovel...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
					 (near tears)
		He was the worst!

ON THE KIDS' COLLECTIVE REACTION as they realize who it was... and then 
they hear the front door open...

In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his 
back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.

					KIDS
		Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt?

					SHOVELER
			   (shocked by this welcome)
		I'm okay--I'm all right.

					EDDIE JR.
		Lean on me, Dad.

					LENORE
		I'll hold your shovel, Dad.

They lead him back into the living room, and give him the prime spot on 
the couch.

					BUTCH
		You want a soda, Dad?

					SHOVELER
					(stunned)
		Okay.

He runs to get it as Eddie Jr. slides a footstool under his feet and 
Tracy puts a pillow behind his back.  Roland, the little one, cuddles 
up next to him, puts his arm around him.

					ROLAND
		Nice work. Dad.

					SHOVELER
		Thanks, Roland.

					ROLAND
		You really are a superhero, aren't you?

The Shoveler nods.  A few minutes later... The Shoveler sits on the 
couch, feet up, soda in hand. The television is off. His kids all 
huddled around him, hanging on his every word.

					SHOVELER
		And that's when the engine blew up.

					KIDS
		Whoa...

					BUTCH
		What did you do?

					SHOVELER
		Well...

ON LUCILLE as she comes in and sees... her husband surrounded by his 
kids, a happy man at last.

EXT.  LAKESIDE DINER - THE NEXT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

INT. THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - ON THE SPLEEN

sitting between the Bowler and a bandaged Invisible Boy. The Bowler has 
her arm chummily around the Spleen's shoulder. The Spleen finally has 
real friends. Doc Heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the 
Raja as the Shoveler listens in. The Sphinx sits at the end of the 
table, silent.

					DOC HELLER
		So you're never actually conscious of range or 
		trajectory?

					RAJA
		Heck no.  I just chuck 'em.

Monica (in her waitress outfit) sits close to a bandaged Mister 
Furious.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong reports.

					DAWN
		It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly 
		psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that 
		left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the 
		city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the 
		question remains... Who were these heroic 
		mystery men who saved our city?...

ON OUR HEROES -

					BOWLER
		Could have been anybody.

They laugh.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name.  
		We're... the Mystery Men.

They all like it, except for the Bowler.

					BOWLER
		Hey, do I look like a Man?

					SHOVELER
		Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

					SPLEEN
			(singing, ala "Macho Man")
		Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery 
		Man...

		  		  SHOVELER & RAJA
		Shut up.

					BOWLER
		Eat your mustard.

					FURIOUS
		It doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  We 
		know who we are.

					RAJA
		Yes, Obie-wan.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Hey... he's gone.

The others see... that the Sphinx's chair is empty.  Raja spots a 
crumpled napkin on the table, opens it up, and reads.

					RAJA
		"Until you need me again... Adios."

A silence... Reactions from our heroes as they realize that the Sphinx 
is gone...

					SHOVELER
		I miss him already.

Suddenly, somewhere in the night, a burst of gunfire and screams are 
heard.  THE FINAL MUSIC BEGINS...

					FURIOUS
		Amigos, duty calls.

The Mystery Men wolf their burgers, then stand and start for the 
street...

As Monica watches them leave, a PATRON asks her:

					PATRON
		Miss... who are those guys?

					MONICA
				(after a moment)
		I don't know.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - A MOMENT LATER

HEROIC GROUP SHOT as the Mystery Men merch down the middle of street, 
toward the sound of the gunfire... and into the night.

THEME AND CREDITS...

THE END
THE MYSTERY MEN

By Neil Cuthbert

Based on the Dark Horse comic created by Bob Burden

Revised June 6, 1997



THEME AND CREDITS...

FADE IN:

EXT.  ERIE HOSPITAL FOR THE CRIMINALLY INSANE - DAY

CAMERA MOVES THROUGH a tangled jungle of razor wire, finally COMING 
INTO VIEW of a foreboding, fortress-like old institution, surrounded by 
towers and gun turrets.  Screaming and horrible laughter is heard from 
within...

CLOSE ON a sign that reads "Erie Hospital for the Criminally Insane" 
... This is where the worst killers and psychos go.

INT.  CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

THE CAMERA PANS THE EXPRESSIONLESS FACES of the REVIEW BOARD as 
CASANOVA FRANKENSTEIN sits across from them.  Dressed in an 
immaculately tailored prison smock (with "Casanova" exquisitely 
embroidered above the pocket), he sits contritely as DOCTOR EMMET 
BIERCE, the hospital's fatherly Chief of Psychiatry, presents his case.

					BIERCE
		No one can deny the horrendous nature of Mr. 
		Frankenstein's crimes, but in the twenty years 
		he has been with us, I have never seen a 
		patient turn his energies to more productive 
		use.

CASANOVA, the picture of remorse and repentance.

					BIERCE
		Just look at his accomplishments... three 
		volumes of poetry, two rock operas, a sculpture 
		garden, four romance novels... and who can 
		forget his touching portrayal of Billy Bigelow 
		in our all-psychotic production of 
		"Carousel"...

ON SEVERAL OF THE BOARD getting misty eyed at the memory of that 
brilliant performance...

					BIERCE
		Directed by our own Doctor Anabel Leek.

ON DOCTOR ANABEL LEEK, the hospital's icily beautiful, ultra cool, top 
shrink.

A moment later Casanova addresses them... His manner is charming, 
sincere, his voice soft, filled with emotion.  He is a master of 
seduction.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago I was a lost soul.  
		Loveless...
		(with a son-like glance at Doctor Bierce)
		Fatherless...
		(chokes on the word)
		A... psycho!
		(breaks down sobbing)
		Oh!  How could I have done it? The murder... 
		the mayhem... all of those lovely young girls!
		(weeping, a brilliant performance)
		I'm sorry!  I'm SO SO SORRY!

Doctor Bierce wipes the tears from his eyes.  Reactions from the board, 
moved, as Casanova weeps convulsively.  Doctor Leek shows no reaction.

					CASANOVA
				(pulls himself together)
		But my deeds have been done, and my youth is 
		gone, and we can only go forward in this cruel 
		world... and if I have learned anything from my 
		wretched life it is that... When you walk 
		through a storm, keep your head held high...
					(singing)
		And don't be afraid of the dark...

Tears plop dawn the cheeks of the review board as the FULLY 
ORCHESTRATED STRAINS OF "WHEN YOU WALK THROUGH A STORM" SWELL...

SERIES OF SHOTS - AS THE MUSIC CONTINUES

A hand stamps Casanova's file "CURED"... Casanova shakes hands and 
embraces the tearful members of the review board, finishing with a 
paternal hug from Doctor Bierce.

In his cell a guard delivers Casanova his favorite old disco suit 
(that's been waiting far him for twenty years).

Casanova, dressed in the suit, walks down the central aisle of the 
lock-up... A moment later he steps out of the massive gates of the 
hospital, and takes his first deep breath of freedom... while in an 
office window high above Bierce and the members of the review board 
stand watching, very proud...

But suddenly THE MUSIC CHANGES TO SEVENTIES DISCO as a black Ferrari 
drives up, and Doctor Leek, now dressed very sexily, gets out... As the 
review board watches in stunned silence, Casanova and Anabel perform a 
nifty little disco twirl, finishing with a very lewd kiss...

Bierce, watching, realizes he's been duped... as Casanova, grinning up 
at him, puts a long gold chain (his favorite weapon) around his neck... 
Bierce, horrified, picks up the telephone... as Casanova and Anabel get 
in the car.

INT.   THE CAR - A MOMENT LATER

Casanova and Anabel drive off.  The massive old hospital is seen 
through the rear window behind them, as Casanova calmly looks at his 
watch...

CLOSE ON HIS WATCH -

as the second hand just swings toward the twelve.  It is exactly twelve 
noon...

BACK ON CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
				(almost wistfully)
		Boom.

And the hospital EXPLODES in a HUGE FIREBALL that completely consumes 
it.

					CASANOVA
		Those gas leaks can be murder.

EXT.  THE ROAD - DAY

The Ferrari drives past and the CAMERA HOLDS ON a sign that reads 
"We1come to Champion City, home of Captain Amazing". The city itself, a 
crumbling rust belt metropolis (ala Detroit) can be seen stretched out 
along the shore of Lake Champion off in the distance...

INSIDE THE CAR - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
		I'm home.

BACK ON THE ROAD  - CONTINUOUS

The Ferrari drives under a much larger billboard that looms over the 
road, showing a picture of Captain Amazing himself, a square jawed 
classic superhero, staring fiercely into the camera.  The caption reads 
"Crime.  Don't even think about it."

EXT.  TRAIN YARDS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

Letters read "Six months later"...

as the CAMERA EXPLORES the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, 
CRUISING past piles of tires and abandoned train cars...

CAMERA PICKS UP a battered van as it drives through the yard, then 
pulls up beside an old boxcar.  The back of the van is thrown open, a 
ramp is thrown down, and THE RED EYES, a gang of vicious small time 
thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading 
their night's haul... RED EYE 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down 
the ramp.

					RED EYE 1
		Golf anyone?

Several more Red Eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes 
still attached, a barber pole, a Virgin Mary lawn statue, and a top of 
the line baby stroller... while their leader, BIG RED, stands in the 
door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.

					RED EYE 2
		Not a bad night's work.

					BIG RED
		Who said crime don't pay?

The Red Eyes laugh... as Red Eye 3 takes the cover off the baby 
stroller and sees... that there's a BABY still in it.

					RED EYE 3
		Hey, Boss, we got a stowaway.

The crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs 
at them.

					RED EYE 4
				(about to slug him)
		Who you laughin' at, punk?

					RED EYE 2
		He's just a tyke.  Lighten up.

					RED EYE 5
		He's kinda cute.

					RED EYE 3
		If you like drool.

					RED EYE 2
		Hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents?  
		For a million bucks!

The others think that's a great idea, but Big Red doesn't.

					BIG RED
		And what if he rats on us?

The others hadn't thought of that.

					RED EYE 3
		So what should we do with him?

					BIG RED
		Stick a brick in his Pampers and dump him in 
		the lake.

The others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.

					RED EYE 3
		Come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.

But suddenly there is another presence... A man in a blue turban and 
cape with the initials "BR" on his chest has appeared... He is THE BLUE 
RAJA.

					RAJA
		Not so fast, gentlemen--and I use the term 
		loosely... Unhand that youngster...

Another man steps into the light.  He wears a construction helmet and 
mask.  There is an "S" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel.  He 
is THE SHOVELER.

					SHOVELER
		Or you're mulch.

He brandishes his shovel for effect.  The Red Eyes look at these two, 
highly amused.

					BIG RED
		What are you guys supposed to be... 
		superheroes?

A third man steps out.  His costume is less dramatic than the others.  
He wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames 
on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his 
haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous 
of the three.  He is MISTER FURIOUS.

					FURIOUS
		We ARE superheroes!

					BIG RED
		Really?  Did you mother make those costumes?

The crooks howl with laughter.

					BIG RED
		This is our territory.  Beat it.

					FURIOUS
		Over YOUR dead body.

Big Red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.

					BIG RED
		0ooooo, he's scary.

The Red Eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes 
through the air and implants itself in Big Red's backside.  He howls 
with pain, pulls it out and examines it... It's a silver dessert fork.

					BIG RED
		A fork!

The Raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver 
forks.

					RAJA
		And there's plenty more where that came from.

Big Red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more Red Eyes step out of 
an old caboose... including MIKEY, a four hundred pound behemoth.  He 
is eating a container of Ben and Jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, 
taking huge bites out of it, container and all.

RAJA AND SHOVELER, reacting... Gulp.  This was more than they'd 
bargained for.  But Furious just growls; he's game.

					BIG RED
		GET 'EM!

The Red Eyes attack... Mister Furious goes into a furious face; his 
hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming 
crooks...

A Red Eye takes a swing at the Shoveler--but he simply puts up his 
shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan.  The crook yelps with 
pain and shakes his battered hand... as the Raja fends off crooks, 
poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, 
watching and laughing, really enjoying the show.  (There's no real 
martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley 
brouhaha.)

But there's too many of then... The Raja goes down under swinging 
fists... and so does the Shoveler...

Furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and 
rights--until Mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of 
him and crushing him under his massive weight.

					RED EYES
		Crush him, Mikey!... Mash him!... Mush him!

					FURIOUS
			(barely audible under all that meat)
		Is that all you got?

					RED EYES
		He wants more!... Squish him!... Finish him 
		off!

					FURIOUS
					(faintly)
		Your mother!

Mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative 
voice is heard.

					VOICE (0.S.)
		Is there a problem?

Everything suddenly stops, as the Red Eyes look up and see... CAPTAIN 
AMAZING standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the 
light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique 
sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting 
heroically in the wind.  He is superhero perfection incarnate.

ON THE RED EYES as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...

					RED EYES
		IT'S CAPTAIN AMAZING!

Big Red and a couple others try to run for it, but Amazing leaps ca-
like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash.  As the baby claps his 
hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat-up awe, Amazing 
deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly 
delivered elbows and kicks. He is the consumate superhero, and he 
doesn't even break a sweat.

The remaining Red Eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in 
surrender.

					RED EYES
		We give!... We're sorry!... We had terrible 
		childhoods!  (Etc.)

Police cars and a TV truck come screeching into the train yard... and 
the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and 
reporters...

Our three heroes try to approach Captain Amazing (who still looks fresh 
as a daisy).

					RAJA
		Nice work, Captain.

But Amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they 
didn't even exist.  He goes to greet DAWN WONG (Champion City's answer 
to Connie Chung).

					AMAZING
			(turning on the old superhero charm)
		Hi. Dawn.

					DAWN
			(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)
		Looks like you've done it again, Captain.

					AMAZING
		It's what I do.

Our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated.  Furious growls.  
Suddenly, TWO COPS are accosting them.

					COP 1
		Okay, show's over. Move it. On your way.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute, Officers. You don't understand--
		we're superheroes, and we just busted up this 
		gang.

					COP 1
		Really?  Let me guess-you're Towel Head and 
		he's...
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Captain Pooper Scooper!

The cops crack up.  Furious growls at them.  The cops yank out their 
nightsticks.

					COP 1
		Hey!  Move it!

					COP 2
		Get a life!

					COP 1
		And leave crime fighting to the real thing!

Shoveler and Raja pull Furious away before he gets into real trouble... 
The cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.

					COP 1
		Wannabes.

					COP 2
		Pathetic.

EXT.  THE LAKESIDE DINER - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

An inner city greasy spoon.

INT.  THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

on which Captain Amazing, the laughing baby in his arms, is being 
interviewed by Dawn Wong.  He's playing the cutsy photo op for all its 
worth, gootchy-gooing the kid, etc.  Dawn is creaming.

Our three heroes sit at a booth in the back of the diner, watching the 
tube...

					RAJA
				(nursing a sore jaw)
		He doesn't miss a trick, does he?

					FURIOUS
		What a jerk--and like nobody knows who he really is!

					SHOVELER
		Oh don't start that again--

					FURIOUS
		LOOK!

Furious picks up the newspaper on which there is a photo of a good 
looking guy in a tux at a benefit... The headline reads "Lance Hunt 
Hosts Benefit."  He holds the picture up next to the television, so the 
faces of Lance Hunt and Captain Amazing are side by side.  It is 
obviously the same guy.

					FURIOUS
		He's Lance Hunt!  Just take off the glasses--
		and it's him!

					RAJA
		There's a vague similarity.

					FURIOUS
		A vague similarity?  IT'S THE SAME GUY!

					SHOVELER
				(downing some aspirin)
		0h, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take 
		this anymore.  Night after night we're on the 
		streets, busting our humps--and for what?

					RAJA
		We take the licks and he gets the chicks.

					SHOVELER
		How long do you have to chase a dream before 
		you realize it's not gonna happen?

					FURIOUS
		We need a break, that's all! Nobody'd ever 
		heard of him until he busted Casanova 
		Frankenstein!

					RAJA
		But look at him... and look at us.

					SHOVELER
		The camera loves him.

A depressed silence.  Furious turns his attention to the napkin 
dispenser.

					FURIOUS
				     (furious)
		Why do they always fill stuff these things so 
		full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 
		'em!
				   (rips one out)

					RAJA
		I lost another fork tonight.  She's getting 
		suspicious, I know it.

					FURIOUS
		So why don't you just tell her!

					RAJA
		I can't.

					FURIOUS
		Why not?

					RAJA
				     (upset)
		Because I can't!  Okay?  She wouldn't 
		understand!

					SHOVELER
		Leave him alone.  She's his mother, not yours.

					FURIOUS
		We had an off night, that's all.

					SHOVELER
		So when are we gonna have an on night?

A WAITRESS is standing at the table.

					WAITRESS
		Hi.

They look at her, taken aback.  She's very pretty.

					RAJA
		You're... new.

					WAITRESS
		It's my first night.  My name's Monica.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, smitten by her, but almost afraid to look at her.  
Under all that rage, he's in fact shy.

					MONICA
		You guys going to a costume party?

					RAJA
		We're superheroes.

					MONICA
		Really?  Like Captain Amazing?

Furious growls.

					MONICA
		Are you famous?

					RAJA
		Not yet.

					MONICA
		So you're like... struggling superheroes?

					RAJA
		We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I 
		am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware...
				(does a very impressive
				little flipping thing with
				his place setting)

					MONICA
		Wow.

					RAJA
		And these are my associatiates, the Shoveler.
	
					SHOVELER
		Hi.

					RAJA
		And Mister Furious... His anger is his power.

					MONICA
				(intrigued by Furious)
		Really?

					RAJA
		Usually a superpower is a magical endowment or 
		a great skill.  In his case, it's entirely 
		emotional.

					MONICA
		So what can I get you?

					RAJA
		Burgers all around.
				(meaning himself)
		Medium.
				(meaning the Shoveler)
		Rare.
				(meaning Furious}
		Raw.

A moment later as Monica walks away, Furious can't help but
watch her.  The Raja replaces the diner's dinnerware with the good 
stuff from his coat.

					RAJA
		She likes you.

					SHOVELER
		Definitely.

					RAJA
		Ask her out.

					FURIOUS
		Nah.

					RAJA
		Roy, when was the last time you had an actual 
		date?

					FURIOUS
				(getting very pissed off)
		What does it matter?  Women just want to 
		control you--and talk about their feelings.  
		They want to know why you're angry all the 
		time--and what can they can do to help--so you 
		tell them there's nothing--nothing--just leave 
		me alone--but they bug you and they bug you and 
		they bug you--until you just can't stand it 
		anymore!--so you finally open up--you pop like 
		a blister--and it all comes spewing out--all 
		your emotions--your feelings--your fears--all 
		of it!
					(after a beat)
		And then they dump you.

					RAJA
		So you're chicken?

					FURIOUS
				     (fiercely)
		Who's chicken?
					(gets up)

Monica stands at the counter placing her order.  Furious approaches 
her, leans against the counter.  For a moment he just stands there, 
fuming, unable to think of anything to say. She isn't sure what to make 
of this.

					FURIOUS
		Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you 
		really want to talk to somebody you can't think 
		of anything to say!

					MONICA
		I guess... Are you always so angry?

					FURIOUS
		Only when I'm awake... You busy after work?

She shrugs.

					FURIOUS
		Want to go out and get drunk?

She's visibly turned off by that.

					FURIOUS
		Or talk?

					MONICA
		Not tonight.
			(picks up an order and walks away)

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE DINER - LATER

Furious, the Raja, and the Shoveler step out.

					RAJA
		Maybe you should try a more romantic approach.

					FURIOUS
			(gets on his old Harley)
		Like what?  Cutting off my own ear?

					RAJA
		Or flowers.

					FURIOUS
		See ya tomorrow.

Furious kicks his engine started and speeds off into the night as the 
Shoveler opens the door of his battered Ford Esquire station wagon, and 
the Raja gets into his ancient Datsun.

EXT.  RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT

The Shoveler pulls into the driveway of his very modest house. The 
front yard looks like a battle zone.  Bikes and kids' junk are 
everywhere.

LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

as big a disaster area as the front yard. His kids, EDDIE JR. (15), 
LENORE (12), BUTCH (10), TRACY (7), and ROLAND (5) are all sprawled in 
front of the television. The Shoveler enters, and his kids don't even 
bother to look up from the tube.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, when are you guys gonna clean this place 
		up?

					TRACY
		When you're on TV.

					EDDIE JR.
		Right--like that will ever happen.

					LENORE
		Save any babies lately?

ON THE SHOVELER, silent, hurt.

					TRACY
		Faster than a speeding turtle--

					BUTCH
		More powerful than a deodorant--

					EDDIE JR.
		Able to eat twelve donuts in a single sitting--

					LENORE
		Look, snoring in his chair--

					EDDIE JR.
		Sitting on the john--

					ALL
		It's... Supergut!

The kids all laugh (in that derisive way that kids do so well) as the 
Shoveler dejectedly walks into the kitchen.

INT.  KITCHEN - A MOMENT LATER

The Shoveler enters, dejected.  His wife, Lucille, is doing the dishes.  
She looks up, sees him.

					LUCILLE
				  (feels for him)
		Rough night, Eddie?

He nods.

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

The Raja's Datsun is parked in front of a neat as a pin little 
Victorian house.

INT.  THE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Someone is sneaking around.  A drawer is quietly 
opened, and we hear the gentle clink of silver. Suddenly, the light 
goes on and we see the Blue Raja, now dressed in a sport shirt and 
slacks, with his hand in the drawer.  His MOTHER, in her nightclothes, 
stands by the door where she has just switched on the light.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey!

					RAJA
		Oh hi, Mom.

					MOTHER
		What are you doing in the silver drawer?

					RAJA
		Looking for... the TV Guide.

She just looks at him, very suspicious.

					MOTHER
		It's on the television.

					RAJA
		Of course.  I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.  
		Go to bed.

He kisses her and goes into the next room.  CAMERA HOLDS ON MOM; she 
doesn't trust him.

EXT.  HILLTOP - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

A billboard overlooking the city.  Captain Amazing is posed wearing a 
pair of bright blue Nikes.  The caption reads. "It's a nice world.  
Sonebody's got to save it... The Nike Supershoe.  It's Amazing."

Furious sits on his Harley, taking long hauls from a pint bottle of 
cheap bourbon and gazing up at the sign.

					FURIOUS
		Amazing?  What's so amazing about him?  I'd be 
		amazing, too, if I'd inherited two hundred 
		million bucks... or two bucks... or two 
		cents...
			(hurls the empty bottle, smashing
				it against the sign)
		Who am I kidding?  Dreams don't come true.

A moment of despondency, and then he hears a strange sound overhead and 
looks up...

HIS POV -

as something suddenly flies across the star filled night sky above 
him...

It is Captain Amazing, wearing a high tech rocket pack on his back...


					FURIOUS
		Where's he going?
			(kicks his Harley started)

SERIES OF SHOTS - WITH MUSIC

as Furious, following Captain Amazing, rides roughshod down the steep 
hill, skidding onto a road and then speeding through a residential 
area...

He cuts onto some railroad tracks, hops his bike up on a rail, and 
rides smoothly along it, following Amazing... He turns off the tracks, 
rides roughly through some woods, then emerges from the trees and 
sees..

A foreboding looking old mansion... Captain Amazing lands on the 
highest part of its roof... Furious pulls up, gazes at the front gates 
of the mansion...

HIS POV -

Letters across the iron gates read... "Frankenstein".

EXT.  ON THE ROOF - CONTINUOUS

Captain Amazing abandons his jet pack and moves across the old slate 
roof like Spiderman, leaping nimbly from gable to gable and walking 
along a high ridge like a tight rope walker. Finally he approaches a 
skylight, looks down and sees...

A huge old library with an iron catwalk running around it. Casanova 
Frankenstein sits in a club chair by a roaring tire. Anabel perches on 
the arm of his chair.  In the other chair sits a once good looking, now 
paunchy guy, with a meticulously coiffed haircut.  He is TONY 
POMPADOUR, head of the infamous Disco Boys.

0N CAPTAIN AMAZING

					AMAZING
				(just as he suspected)
		Uh-huh.

He sees that the skylight is open, and quietly lets himself in...

INT.  THE LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Tony P savor glasses of brandy and puff on big cigars.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you enjoy these cigars.  I had to kill a 
		dozen Cubans to get them.

					TONY P
		Ummm.

					CASANOVA
		Have you considered my offer?

					TONY P
		You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved 
		workin' for you.  You had such style: the 
		clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd 
		snuff a babe.  You were the King...

Casanova accepts this graciously.

					TONY P
		But times have changed, and you been in that 
		bug house a long tine. I can see you still got 
		the style, but I dunno for sure you still got 
		the edge.

					CASANOVA
		I got it.

					TONY P
		What about Captain Amazing?

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Good question.

Casanova and Tony P look up and see Captain Amazing, posed noncalantly 
on the iron catwalk, gazing down at them.  Tony P jumps out of his 
chair, scared.  But Casanova just smiles at his ancient rival, cool as 
a cucumber.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd cone.  I left that skylight open 
		for you.

					AMAZING
		I know you did.

					CASANOVA
		I knew you'd know.

					AMAZING
		I know you knew I'd know.

					CASANOVA
		But did you know I knew you'd know I'd know?

					AMAZING
		Of course.

Tony P makes a move for his pistol, but Captain Amazing instantly whips 
out his pistol, getting the drop on him.

					AMAZING
		I'd hate to waste a good bullet on a piece of 
		scum like you, Tony.

Tony freezes.

					AMAZING
		The jig is up, Casanova.  I've spent six months 
		watching you, and know exactly what you're up 
		to.

					CASANOVA
		Really?

					AMAZING
		I know that you're recruiting your old 
		henchmen...

Nervous reaction from Tony P.

					AMAZING
		I know who your girlfriend really is...

Icy reaction from Anabel.

					AMAZING
		And I know the terrible revenge that you plan 
		to inflict on this city.

					CASANOVA
		I guess you know just about everything, don't 
		you, Lance?

					AMAZING
		Um-hmm.

					CASANOVA
		Except for one little thing.

					AMAZING
				(supremely confident)
		And what's that?

					CASANOVA
		That I've hot wired the city's entire power 
		supply through that catwalk.

					AMAZING
		What--?

Casanova suddenly throws a secret breaker switch, and the ugly hum of a 
million volts instantly fills the room...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - ON FURIOUS

still watching... as all the lights in the house go out, except for a 
frightening orange glow in an upper room...

Off in the distance Furious sees... the lights of the entire city 
flicker and then black out... A moment later the mansion, and the 
city's lights return to normal... as Furious watches, not sure what to 
make of this.

EXT. STREET CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY

Traffic is snarled.  Horns are blasting.  Tempers are frayed.

CLOSE ON A HAMMERING JACKHAMMER... CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL that it is 
being operated by the Shoveler, dressed in work clothes.  Wiped out 
from the night before, the vibrations of the hamer are lulling him off 
to sleep... He nods out... as his BOSS whacks him on the arm.

					BOSS
		YO! CAPTAIN SOMINEX!  Get your shut-eye at 
		home, or you'll be a full time superhero!

EXT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

INT.  THE RAJA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The Raja lies sprawled on his bed, depressed, still in his pee jays, as 
he watches... an ANTHONY ROBBINS infomercial ON THE TV.

					ANTHONY
		It's all within your power.  The only thing 
		that's in your way is YOU!

					RAJA
		Easy for you to say.

EXT.  SALLY'S AUTO DEMOLITION - DAY - ESTABLISHING

An auto junkyard and demotion yard.

EXT.  THE YARD - DAY

A giant press mashes an old car... while nearby Mister Furious does the 
job by hand, demolishing an old Grand Prix with an iron bar.  He does 
it as easily as a normal guy would tear apart a corrugated box, ripping 
off the doors, then tearing off the bumpers and the hood and tossing 
the pieces onto a big pile... His big boned, red faced boss SALLY is 
calling out to him.

					SALLY
		Hey, Roy!

EXT.  THE BACK OF THE YARD - A MINUTE LATER

In a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard Sally and Furious stand 
looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. It is a Herkimer Battle 
Jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier 
(designed by the Pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on 
battlefield fact finding tours).  Overgrown with weeds, home to an 
extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are 
over.

					SALLY
		How many times I gotta tell you about this?

					FURIOUS
		Sally, that's a Herkimer Battle Jitney!  They 
		don't make 'em like that anymore.  It's a 
		classic!

					SALLY
		It's a hunk of junk.  I want the iron.  Do it!

She walks away.  Furious growls.  He picks up his iron bar and is about 
to wedge it under the front bumper of the Herkimer...

HIS POV -

But the big old headlights and the sad old grill seem to be looking at 
hint, imploring him for one last chance...

And he just can't do it.  He throws away his iron bar and climbs inside 
the cab of the Herkimer...

IN THE CAB - CONTINUOUS

Furious sits behind the wheel and tenderly touches its beat-up old 
dashboard, then turns on the radio, which, miraculously still works.  
He tunes in a local station, puts his feet up on the dash.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		...and continues to deny any knowledge of the 
		incident... In local news, millionaire Lance 
		Hunt has apparently disappeared...

ON FURIOUS, taking immediate notice.

					RADIO ANNOUNCER
		Members at his household told police that the 
		playboy philanthropist failed to return home 
		last night after "going out for a walk".  
		Police say they have no reason yet to suspect 
		foul play, but a search is under way...

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Furious, the Shoveler, and the Raja all sit at their booth.

					FURIOUS
		I saw him go in--and he didn't come out!
	
					RAJA
		But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.

Furious groans.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, look.

ON THE TV -

Casanova is being interviewed by DON STOUFFER, the local Mike Wallace.

					CASANOVA
		Well, Don, I've done some terrible things in my 
		life, but now I'm cured, and I just want to 
		give back something to my old home town... 
		That's why I'm using what's left of my fortune 
		to build...

CLOSE ON A MODEL of a huge concrete bunker-like institutional structure 
(i.e.  the Getty)

					CASANOVA (O.S.)
		The Frankenstein Center for the Arts.

					DON
		You've changed, haven't you?

		CASANOVA
		Oh yes.

BACK ON FURIOUS, RAJA, and SHOVELER - 

					FURIOUS
		No he hasn't.

EXT.  FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - NIGHT - ANGLE ON

the wall of the estate... as our heroes' three heads rise up over  
it... and survey the grounds.

					FURIOUS
				(about to climb over)
		Let's go.

					RAJA
			(in a whisper, holding him back)
		Wait!... Look!

THEIR POV -

A group of men are hanging around the door to the house, smoking, 
chatting, and laughing.  A CLOSER ANGLE REVEALS that they are all 
dressed in the height (or depths) of seventies disco fashion.  One of 
them is showing off some steps.

Our heroes fall back behind the safety of the wall and confer.


					RAJA
		This is bad.

					SHOVELER
		Who are they?

					RAJA
		The Disco Boys.


					FURIOUS
		The who?

					RAJA
		The most vicious gang of thugs this city ever 
		produced.  Twenty years ago they were 
		Casanova's personal bodyguard.  But after he 
		was busted they crawled into the woodwork.

					FURIOUS
		Well they've crawled back out.

					SHOVELER
		We may be getting in over our heads here.

					RAJA
		This looks like a job for Superman--

					SHOVELER
		Or Batman--

					RAJA
		Or both.

					FURIOUS
		Don't you guys get it?  If Captain Amazing is 
		still in there, we can rescue him--and get on 
		TV!
			   (goes right over the wall)

They share an exasperated look, then scramble over the wall after him.

INT.  CASANOVA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and Dr. Anabel Leek are preparing for bed.  Anabel sits in 
front of a huge mirror, brushing her long hair as Casanova moves up 
behind her and puts his hands around her throat, massaging, squeezing, 
just barely resisting the temptation to strangle her.  (She loves it).

					CASANOVA
		Everything's going exactly as we planned.

					ANABEL
			(puts the sharp point of her
			comb handle under his chin)
		Not quite.  You haven't announced our 
		engagement yet.

					CASANOVA
		It must have slipped my mind.

					ANABEL
		Your mind is so slippery.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Pootchkie.  My womanizing days are 
		over.  You're my Lady Macbeth, my Imelda... my 
		Nicole.
				(pulls her into his arms)
		We're such an incredible team.  Who could 
		possibly stop us?
		(kisses her)

CUT RIGHT TO:

EXT.  THE LAWN - CONTINUOUS - ON OUR THREE HEROES

as they crunch their way non too stealthily across the backyard.

					RAJA
		Don't crunch the leaves.

					SHOVELER
		Sorry.

					RAJA
		Be a Mohican.
	    		   (bumps into a lawn chair)

					FURIOUS
		Wait.
				(They all stop.)
		I hear something.

They all listen; there is a low rushing sound... It is the sound of 
water rushing through pipes.  Suddenly, the lawn sprinklers all pop 
up... and our heroes get drenched.  They duck off the lawn, behind the 
cover of a large tree.

					RAJA
		I'm soaked.
				    (sneezes)
		Oh great.

					FURIOUS
		Shhh.

					SHOVELER
		Be a Mohican. 

					RAJA
		Shut up.

Furious sees a pair of French doors, off a small patio.  One of the 
doors is slightiy open.

					FURIOUS
		Come on.

They start sneaking toward it, but as they cross the patio... they trip 
the automatic security lighting, and suddenly find themselves bathed in 
light.

					RAJA
		Uh-oh.

As our heroes look around as a dozen Disco Boys, armed with pipes, 
chains, brass knuckles, step into the light and encircle them... The 
French doors open and Tony P steps out.

					RAJA
		Oh I'm sorry.  We must have the wrong house.

					TONY P
		You sure do.

The Disco Boys attack.  The Raja is instantly clubbed down. The 
Shoveler deflects only a blow or two with his shovel before he goes 
down, too... These guys are not the Red Eyes.

Only Furious holds his own.  He grabs a pipe away from one of them and 
swings fiercely, keeping the others off.  Suddenly, the Disco Boys pull 
back.  Furious doesn't know why, until he turns and sees...

Casanova, standing right behind him, smiling.

					CASANOVA
		Hi there.

With a cat-like move Casanova slashes his gold chain viciously--and 
repeatedly--across Furious' face.  Furious, stunned with pain, lunges 
at Casanova, who neatly steps aside, then catches him with a fast 
combination of spinning disco kicks.  Finally he lassos the chain 
around Furious' neck, and pulls it tight, strangling him.

ON THE DISCO BOYS, watching, snapping their fingers with admiration...

Casanova releases Furious, who slumps to the ground.  Casanova steps 
away, and the Disco Boys gather around Furious and kick him 
viciously... as Casanova and Tony P watch, amused, chuckling.

					CASANOVA
		Superheroes.

					TONY P
		Should I kill them?

					CASANOVA
				(completely disdainful)
		Why bother?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE MANSION - A MOMENT LATER

The Disco Boys drag our heroes through the gate and throw them like 
bags of garbage into the street... where thay lie in a moaning, 
agonized, semi-conscious heap.

INT.  THE DINER - LATER - CLOSE ON

Furious, rubbing his neck; a thin red mark runs around it. The three of 
them are sitting at their usual table, in very bad shape, moaning and 
groaning... Monica approaches.  She's made them ice packs and cold 
compresses.

					MONICA
		Here you go.
			(sits with them, applies a compress
				to the Raja's head)

					RAJA
		Ow.

					MONICA
		Maybe you guys ought to forget this Superhero 
		stuff and join Kiwanis or something.

A FUSSY CUSTOMER is calling out from another table.

					FUSSY CUSTORER
		Miss!

She moves off.

					RAJA
		Maybe she's right.

					FURIOUS
				(still furious)
		Are you serious? This is the break we've been 
		waiting for!

					SHOVELER
		What are you talking about?

					FURIOUS
		What have the famous superheroes got that we 
		don't?

					RAJA
		Agents?

					FURIOUS
		Archenemies!  Casanova isn't just a criminal--
		he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our 
		ticket to fame, fortune--and babes!

					SHOVELER
		And it would be the right thing to do.

					FURIOUS
				   (dismissively)
		Yeah yeah--and that, too.

					RAJA
		But there's only three of us, and he's got the 
		entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.

					FURIOUS
		Then maybe it's time for us to form our own 
		brotherhood...
					(more)
	
					FURIOUS (Cont'd)
		a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, 
		skull cracking, Disco Boy bashing, warriors of 
		the night!

					SHOVELER
		I'm liking this.

					FURIOUS
		I say we send out the word--and summon all of 
		the unsung superheroes we know!

					RAJA
				(after a moment)
		Yeah, but... who do we know?

They take a long moment to ponder this.

					FURIOUS
		Well... there's the Spleen.

Shoveler and Raja make disgusted noises.

					RAJA
		Do we have to?

					SHOVELER
		I got this cousin.  He's a real doofus, but he 
		claims he can become invisible.

					FURIOUS
		Have you ever seen him?

					SHOVELER
		How could I see him if he's invisible?

					FURIOUS 
		Good point.

					RAJA
		And there's the Sphinx.

					SHOVELER
		The who?

					RAJA
		He's a legendary masked Mexican crime fighting 
		superwrestler and master of the machete.

					FURIOUS
		Sounds good.

					RAJA
		No one's sure that he actually exists, but they 
		say he can be contacted by leaving a message on 
		a crumpled up napkin at the Tacky Taco down by 
		the bus station.

					SHOVELER
		Get outta here.

EXT.  TACKY TACO - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A funky Mexican restaurant by the bus station.

INT.  THE RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes, in normal clothing, have just finished a taco lunch.  
Furious is writing a mssage on a napkin with a ballpoint pen.

					FURIOUS
		You sure that's how you spell it?

					SHOVELER
		Yeah.

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Spinks, we need you."

They crumple up the napkin and leave the restaurant... A moment later a 
shy looking MEXICAN MAN busses their tray... but in A CLOSE ANGLE we 
see him secretly pocket the napkin.

EXT. HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

A little brick house.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

A teenage boy's room, decorated to the max with models and posters of 
the great superheroes: Batman, Spiderman, Captain Amazing, etc.  
INVISIBLE BOY, about fifteen, is being interviewed by the Raja, Mister 
Furious, and the Shoveler.

					FURIOUS
		So, let me get this straight.  You have the 
		power to become invisible.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		But... only when no one is looking.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		If someone looks at you, you immediately become 
		visible again.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible... to yourself?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		No.

					OUR HEROES
					(hopefully)
		No?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		If I look at myseif, I become visible.

					RAJA
		So you're only invisible, when abuolutely no 
		one is looking at you?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yes.

					FURIOUS
		So how do you know that you've ever been 
		invisible?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I just know.

Our heroes are less than impressed.

					FURIOUS
		Look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to 
		interview--

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(desperate)
		I know I haven't got it entirely worked out 
		yet, but I've always dreamed of becoming a 
		superhero... Weren't you guys ever a kid? 
		Didn't you ever need someone to just give you a 
		chance?

ON OUR HEROES, looking around the room... and softening up.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT

Our heroes sit at their usual table along with Invisible Boy and a 
weird looking guy in a greasy, stained yellow superhero outfit.  Across 
his chest in falling off stick on letters it reads "THE SPLEEN", and 
that's exactly who he is.  Furious, the Raja, and Shoveler sit as far 
away from him as possible. He is a totally noxious, hyperactive 
person... and he is thrilled to be there.

					SPLEEN
		Boy I can't tell you how thrilled I was when 
		you guys called--You gonna eat that pickle?
				   (sucks it in)
		I've always dreamed of being a member of the a 
		real superhero team--and to have friends--real 
		friends--I mean guys I could live with--sleep 
		with--die with--eat with...

He puts the mustard dispenser to his lips and squeezes it straight into 
his mouth.

					SPLEEN
		I love mustard.

Furious, Raja, and the Shoveler react; they can't believe they've 
actually invited this guy to join their group.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		So what exactly is your superpower?

					SPLEEN
		Well, when I was a kid I grew up on Love Canal-
		-remember that?--and my brothers and I used to 
		go swimming in it--make Kool-Aid out of it--
		stuff like that.  Anyway my brothers all died, 
		but I lived, and I grew all these like weird 
		organs that have never been seen in humans 
		before.  So now I can do things like this!

He leans over the table and lets just a little tiny drop of spittle 
dribble onto the table...

CLOSE ON THE TABLE -

as the spittle burns a hole in the Formica.

					SPLEEN
		Cool, huh?

The Spleen inadvertently gives the tiniest little burp, and our three 
heroes duck out of the way or under the table.

				FURIOUS, RAJA, & SHOVELER
		Watch it!... Look out!... Whoa!

The people in the next booth give a cry of revulsion, put their hands 
to their mouths, and immediately leave.

					SPLEEN
		Sorry, sorry.

					SHOVELER
		Hey, why don't you just put a cork in it?

					SPLEEN
		I tried that once.  The cork melted.

THE SAME - AFTER DINNER

Our heroes mull their situation over coffee.  Monica freshens their 
cups.  The Spleen squirts mustard in his coffee.

					SHOVELER
		There's just not enough of us.

					FURIOUS
		But we know they're out there. Hundreds--maybe 
		thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who 
		desperately need a cause...

					RAJA
		And a social life.

					SHOVELER
		Yeah, but how do we get to them?

					SPLEEN
		Obscene phone calls?

They ignore that suggestion.

					MONICA
		Why don't you throw a barbecue?
			(moves off to another table)

ON OUR HEROES, realizing that's it.

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT - WITH MUSIC

Invisible Boy sits at the desk in his room, writing immaculate little 
notes on small file cards.  (He's made a whole pile of them.)

CLOSE ON THE NOTE -

which reads "Got superpowers?  Want to fight evil?  Then JOIN US and 
let's PARTY HEARTY!  Beer!  Burgers!  Babes!"

SERIES OF SHOTS - MUSIC CONTINUES

as our heroes post these notes all over the city, in places where 
lonely superheroes night find them...

The Raja posts a note on the door of a comic book store...

The Shoveler posts a note on the bulletin board at a bowling alley...

Mr. Furious tapes the note to the cracked glass of a vandalized phone 
booth...

At an abandoned drive-in movie theater... Invisible Boy walks through 
the empty lot, taping a note to each of the old speaker posts...

A White Castle hamburger joint... Inside the pay toilet Spleen is 
scratching something on the wall with a nail. He stops and admires his 
handiwork, and we see that he has engraved the entire message on the 
wall...

END MUSIC.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - DAY

A small, typical working class backyard.  A round, aluminum above 
ground pool.  A Weber grill with burgers on it. Unopened packages of 
hamburger rolls.  An old Vic Damon record plays on a boom box.  The 
Spleen floats around on a rubber raft in the pool.

					SPLEEN
		Come on in!  The water's great!

In fact, the water is turning a yellowish green... The rest of our 
heroes sit around on cheap folding chairs.  No superheroes have shown 
up.  The Shoveler, at the grill, serves burgers to his kids, who stand 
in line waiting for them.

					BUTCH
				(heavy on the sarcasm)
		Great picnic, Dad.

					EDDIE JR.
		Big turnout.

					ROLAND
		Are these guys real superheroes?

					LENORE
		They think so.

The kids scoff...  A moment later they head back to the house with 
their burgers.

					ROLAND
		But where's Captain Amazing?

					EDDIE JR.
		He wouldn't be caught dead here.

They go into the house.  No one says anything.  The Shoveler just 
stares at the burgers on the grill.  Vic Damon sings. Furious chugs his 
beer; he's working himself into a really morose mood.

ON THE SPLEEN, munching on a chlorine tablet.

					SPLEEN
		Hey, these pool mints are delicious!

Raja looks at his watch.

					RAJA
		Maybe there was traffic.

					FURIOUS
		Who are we kidding?  No one's gonna show.  
		We're living in a fantasy!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Come on, guys--we're fighting against evil.

					FURIOUS
		Good or evil, what's the difference?

					SHOVELER
		There's a big difference.

					FURIOUS
		I used to believe that.  Now I'm not so sure.

					RAJA
		Roy, remember, it is all within your power.  
		The only thing that's in your way... is you.

					FURIOUS
		Oh shut up.

Suddenly, there is a knock at the gate.  Everyone immediately perks up.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		They're here!

A moment later they open the gate and see... HALF A DOZEN BURLY GUYS 
wearing various superhero outfits.

					THEIR LEADER
		Hey, man, is this the superhero wingding?

					RAJA
		This is it.  Come on in!

					SUPERHEROES
		All right!  Party!  (Etc.)

At first glance these guys seem promising... but their outfits are 
decidedly improvised: weird goggles and sunglasses, shower curtain 
capes, baseball caps with beer cans on them.  Their leader holds a 
squeegee with a long handle... Furious is suspicious.

					RAJA
		I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware.

					THEIR LEADER
		I am Squeegee Man, and these are my compadres, 
		the Invincible Dudes!

The Invincible Dudes spot the keg.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Whoa!  Brews!  Party!  (Etc.)

They go immediately to the keg and start filling beer cups and guzzling 
them down.  The Raja tries to hand out some forms.

					RAJA
		Would you mind filling out these forms; names, 
		addresses, description of superpowers, that 
		sort of thing.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Sure, dude.  No problem.  (Etc.)
			(but they just toss the forms away)

ON FURIOUS, watching, starting to get pissed off.

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 1
		Hey, man, like where are the babes?

					INVINCIBLE DUDE 2
		It said on the card there'd be babes!

					RAJA
		Actually we lied about the babes, but there's 
		plenty of burgers.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		That's false advertising!... We came all the 
		way from South Champion, man!  We coulda gone 
		plinking!... We coulda gone bunqee jumping!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No babes.  No peace.

					INVISIBLE DUDES (chanting)
		No babes--no peace!  No babes--no peace!  No 
		babes--no peace!

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		Let's trash the place!

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Yeah!

Furious, fed up, confronts Squeegee Man.

					FURIOUS
		If you're a superhero, what's your power?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		I am Squeegee Man.
			(holding it out threateningly)
		Touch my squeegee... and you die.

The Invincible Dudes are cracking up.

					FURIOUS
		Can you fly?

					SQUEEGEE MAN
		No.

					FURIOUS
		Wanna bet?

EXT.  JUST OUTSIDE THE YARD - CONTINUOUS

as Squeegee Man comes flying--and screaming--over the fence, landing 
none too gracefully in the front yard.

A beat and his squeegee come flying out after him.  Another beat and 
the Invincible Dudes come running out the gate in a panic.

					INVINCIBLE DUDES
		Let's get out of here!... That dude's crazy!

They take off down the street, running right past a woman, carrying a 
bowling ball bag and dressed in a faded, threadbare old rayon superhero 
costume with a decidedly fifties flavor. She is THE BOWLER.

EXT.  SHOVELER'S BACKYARD - A MOMENT LATER

Our heroes sit around the patio, dejected, miserable.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		Who died?

They look up, see her standing there, and aren't quite sure what to 
make of her.

					RAJA
		Who are you?

					BOWLER
		I'm the Bowler.

					SHOVELER
		The Bowler?  I remember him from when I was a
		kid.  He was killed years ago.

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

Our heroes share a look.

					SHOVELER
		Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a
		guy thing.

					BOWLER
		Really?

She takes her bowling ball and spins it on the tip of her finger (like 
a Harlem Globetrotter).  For a long moment she just looks at them, 
smiling.

ON THE OTHERS watching, almost mesmerized by the spinning ball...

Suddenly, she gives an ear splitting battle cry and starts swinging the 
ball around her in wide ferocious arcs, like a cannibal with a war 
club--or a twirler on meth, going so fast she almost becomes a blur...

Then, just as suddenly, she stops, aims and rolls her ball... It shoots 
straight through Invisible Boy's legs...

ON A NEATLY PLACED COLLECTION OF PLASTER LAWN DWARVES -

as the ball smashes into then, pulverizing them... It goes into a 
reverse spin, passes through Invisible Boy's legs again, and returns to 
the Bowler who is holding its bag open for it... The ball rolls in.

					BOWLER
		Good ball.

ON OUR HEROES, left absolutely speechless.

					BOWLER
		If it could zip up its own bag, then you'd be 
		impressed, right?

She turns and walks out.  Our heroes share an amazed look, then run 
after her...

JUST OUTSIDE THE GATE - ON THE BOWLER

walking away... as Furious catches up with her.

					FURIOUS
		Hey... Can I buy you a beer?

					BOWLER
		I thought you'd never ask.

She takes his arm and they all start to walk back into the Shoveler's 
backyard... but the CAMERA PANS ACROSS THE STREET to the dark place 
between two houses, where a MAN WEARING A STRANGE STEEL MASK with a 
frightening, impassively powerful expression stands in the deep 
shadows, watching them in motionless, predatory silence.  We do not 
know who he is, and we cannot tell if he is good or evil.

BACK AT THE BARBECUE - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON

A FADED OLD SNAPSHOT of the original "The Bowler" holding a little girl 
in his arms.

					BOWLER (O.S.)
		He was more than just a superhero...  He was my 
		father...

The others, touched by this, have gathered around the Bowler, who is 
holding the old snapshot in her hand.

					BOWLER
		And then one day, he didn't come home.  The 
		police said it was an accident.  But cargo 
		containers don't just fall on people.  He was 
		murdered... After that I fell apart.  I dropped 
		out of school, became a mud wrestler, married 
		and divorced a jerk.  When my mother died I hit 
		bottom... but then, when I was cleaning out her 
		attic, I found my father's old bowling bag and 
		costume, almost like he'd left them there for 
		me... and I knew what I had to do.

					SHOVELER
		So who killed him?
	
					BOWLER
		The Disco Boys.

					FURIOUS
		You know something? Those guys are really 
		starting TO PISS ME OFF!

					SHOVELER
		But there's still only six of us.

					FURIOUS
		SO WHAT?

					BOWLER
		That's two more than the Fantastic Four.

					FURIOUS
		Half a Dirty Dozen!

					SPLEEN
		Twice the Three Stooges!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		And only one short of the Magnificent Seven.

					RAJA
		And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.

					BOWLER
		He was cute though.

					RAJA
		But they all had one thing we haven't got.

					SPLEEN
		Girlfriends?

					RAJA
		A name.  All the great superhero teams have got 
		a fabulous name.

They all think about it for a moment.  You can almost smell their 
brains overheating.

					BOWLER
		How about... the Savage Six?

					RAJA
		The Inscrutable Six?

					SPLEEN
		The Six Pistols?

					SHOVELER
		The Exterminators!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The Obliterators!

					RAJA
		The Eradicators!

					BOWLER
		The Emasculators!

					SPLEEN
		Wait--I got it!... The Spleen Team.

He gets beaned by a couple of empty soda cans.

					FURIOUS
		To hell with a name.  Let's get to work.

MUSIC UP as Furious stands and starts out.  The others stand and follow 
him... as our heroes form up for their first HEROIC GROUP SHOT.

EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT

MUSIC CONTINUES as A LITTLE OLD LADY crosses the street, when suddenly 
she looks up and sees a pair of headlights coming on fast.  An 
immaculately maintained seventies limo is heading straight for her.

INSIDE THE LIMO - CONTINUOUS

Disco Boys sit in the front.  Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit in the 
back, dressed for a night on the town...

There is a thud as the limo hits the old lady, and everyone in the car 
explodes into laughter.

					TONY P
		Little old lady.  That's a hundred points!

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE LIMO - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the limo drives past a billboard with an ad for "MILK" with a milk 
mustached Captain Amazing looking at the camera...

					TONY P
		He knows your every move.

Tony P imitates a massive electrical convulsion, and the villains crack 
up.

But as they pass the billboard, a pair of headlights illuminate in its 
shadows, and the Shoveler's Ford Esquire pulls out and follows.

INSIDE THE ESQUIRE - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is driving.  Mister Furious sits in the front seat next to 
him, and our other heroes are packed into the back.

					FURIOUS
		Let's say hello.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE TWO CARS - CONTINUOUS

As the limo stops at a traffic light... and the Esquire pulls up 
alongside it.  For a moment good and evil stare each other down.

					TONY P
		Not these guys again!

The Disco Boys howl with laughter.

					CASANOVA
		Nice car.

The D Boys laugh.  Furious stares at Casanova, and Casanova stares 
right back at him, as cool as a snake.

					FURIOUS
		What did you do with Captain Amazing?

					CASANOVA
		Captain who?

					TONY P
				(spots the Bowler)
		Hey, in the backseat, who are you supposed to 
		be, the Bowler?

					BOWLER
		I'm his daughter.

					TONY P
		His daughter?  Well guess what, sweetheart?  
		I'm the one who squished your Daddy.  And he 
		squished real good!

The villains laugh, and Mister Furious EXPLODES INTO RAGE.  He swings 
open his car door, mashing it into the limo and leaving a big dent.

					TONY P
		HEY!

					FURIOUS
		'SCUSE ME!

He starts punching the limo like it's a punching bag--putting big dents 
in it.

					TONY
		Waste him!

Tony and the boys all reach into their coats for their pistols--but as 
they yank them out, the Spleen sticks his head out of the station 
wagon, puts his face right up to the open window of the limo and lets 
loose with a TREMENDOUS BELCH...

As the villains choke and gag in the noxious fumes, Mister Furious goes 
on a DEMOLITION RAMPAGE, working his way around the limo, punching big 
dents with his fists, breaking the windows with his head, flattening 
the tires by kicking them, knocking off the rear view mirror with the 
back of his hand...

Then he leaps up on top of the limo...

While inside the villains gasp for air as big dents are stomped into 
the roof above them...

ANGLE THROUGH THE WINDSHEILD as Furious leaps down onto the hood, and 
gazes in at them.

					FURIOUS
		Shall I check your oil?

He plunges his hand through the metal of the hood, pulls out the car's 
dip stick, and checks it.

					FURIOUS
		Looks fine.

He tosses the dip stick away, then leaps off JUST AS Tony P gets off a 
shot, EXPLODING the windshield of the limo.

Furious lands safely on the hood of the station wagon.  As the Shoveler 
throws the Esquire into gear, Furious shouts...

					FURIOUS
		NICE CAR!

And our heroes streak off into the night... Casanova and the others 
stagger out of the demolished limo, sucking in the clean air.

					CASANOVA
				(impressed by Furious)
		That boy's got talent.

					TONY P
		And I'm gonna nip it in the bud.

ANGLE ON A DARKENED ALLEY -

where the man in the strange steel mask can be seen... watching.

EXT.  A BAR - LATER THAT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

A very typical, nondescript neighborhood place...

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes stand at the bar, celebrating their first victory.

					SHOVELER
		To us!

					RAJA
		Whatever our name is.

They toast and drink.

THE SAME - LATER

The Spleen is passed out at a table, snoring. Shoveler and Invisible 
Boy sit next to him.

					SHOVELER
		Even his snores smell bad.

Raja and Bowler sit at the bar, deep in it.

					BOWLER
		But she's your mother.  You gotta tell her.

					RAJA
		I can't.

ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Dad thinks all this superhero stuff is a stupid 
		waste of time.

					SHOVELER
		But he plays golf, right?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Yeah.

BACK ON RAJA AND BOWLER -

					RAJA
		I'm her only son, and she always had such high 
		hopes for me. Medicine.  Law.

					BOWLER
		But you're a superhero.

					RAJA
		The cape.  The turban.  She wouldn't 
		understand.

					BOWLER
		I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I 
		put on the mask.  They thought I'd lost it.

					RAJA
		But in fact... you'd found it.

They clink their glasses and drink.

BACK ON SHOVELER AND INVISIBLE BOY -

					SHOVELER
		This is your dream... and you can't ever give 
		it up.

The Spleen makes weird noises in his sleep.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		I wonder what he dreams about?

					SHOVELER
		We don't want to know.

Mr. Furious sits alone in the corner, brooding, lost in his own angry 
thoughts..

OUTSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

A black van drives slowly past the bar.

INSIDE THE VAN - CONTINUOUS

The van is packed with Disco Boys.  Tony P sits in the front seat.

					TONY P
		There.

HIS POV -

He has spotted the Ford Esquire parked in the lot.

BACK IN THE BAR - A LITTLE LATER

ON THE BOWLER AND RAJA -

					BOWLER
		It's late.  I'm headin' home.

					RAJA
		Me, too.

					BOWLER
				(to Invisible Boy)
		Come on, Junior, it's a school night.

JUST OUTSIDE - A MONENT LATER

As our heroes, carrying the Spleen, leave.

					FURIOUS
		Anybody up for a little White Castle?

But suddenly the world is a whirling sass of chains and clubs as they 
are bushwhacked by the Disco Boys...

EXT.  AN ALLEY - A LITTLE LATER - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as he comes to with a qroan and sees... the Bowler and Invisible Boy 
tied up and gagged, with the Raja, Shoveler, and the Spleen trussed up 
right next to them.  Furious looks up, sees Tony P standing over him.

					TONY P
		Hi, cutie.

Furious struggles, but he has been secured with some very heavy tire 
chains.  Tony P takes out a large caliber revolver, flips it open to 
make sure it's loaded.

					TONY P
		Six losers. Six bullets. Perfect... Got any 
		last words, Angry Boy?

					FURIOUS
		Disco sucks.

					TONY P
		Disco sucks.  Very good.  You know what I'm 
		gonna do, Angry Boy, since you're so colorful?  
		I'm gonna save you for last.

He turns and points the pistol right at Invisible Boy's head. Furious 
struggles against his chains--to no avail.

					TONY P
		Sweet dreams, punk.

Invisible Boy closes his eyes... Tony P cocks the pistol... But 
suddenly, there is the ring of steel--a broad blade sweeps through the 
air, and Tony P's pistol is sliced neatly in half.

					TONY P
				(holding half a pistol)
		HOLY...

The man is the strange steel mask is standing there, the drawn machete 
still in his hand.

					MAN IN MASK
		Buenos naches.

					TONY P
		Get him!

The Disco Boys rush the newcomer, but he slices through their baseball 
bats with his machete, and sends them reeling and crashing into each 
other with expert forearm blows, whacks with the flat of his blade, and 
head butts with his mask.

Furious struggles to break free and join the fight, but the chains are 
too strong... and the stranger doesn't need any help.

Tony P flicks open a big switchblade and lunges at the stranger, who 
sidesteps him like a matador and swings his machete at him.  Tony P 
turns, about to charge again.

					MAN IN MASK
				    (Mexican accent)
		Would you like me to trim the sides?

					TONY P
		What?

Tony P feels the top of his head, and realizes that the blow from the 
machete has neatly sliced off the top his disco-do, leaving only 
stubble on the top of his head.

					TONY P
			     	  (freaking out)
		LET'S GET OUTTA HERE!

Tony and the Disco Boys run for it...

Furious and the others study their masked savior, who stands before 
them, machete in hand.

					FURIOUS
		You're the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		And you are a fool.

He raises his machete above Furious' head... and then slices clean 
through the chains.

EXT.	AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - LATER THAT NIGHT

Our heroes have gathered around a scrap wood fire in a steel drum. They 
sit on the ground and on old car seats, feeling like schmucks as the 
Sphinx chews theu out, his mask looking very friqhtening and magical in 
the flickering light.

					SPHINX
		You call yourselves superheroes? A rooster 
		fights more intelligently than you!  You have 
		shown yourself to your enemy and revealed your 
		powers to him--and what have you accouplished 
		for this?  You have destroyed his car.  
		Brilliant!  If you want to survive you must 
		fight like a wolf pack--not like a six pack!

Furious sulks, but the others get the point.

					SPHINX
		The wolf is cunning.  He knows that stealth is 
		his greatest weapon, and he always fights as a 
		team...
					(more)

				SPHINX (Cont'd)
				(at Furious)
		Not like some drunken Tejano on Saturday night.

Furious grunts.

					SPHINX
		Casanova Frankenstein is a a master of evil.  
		You will need more than shovels and dessert 
		forks to stop him... What else have you got?

They are silent.

					FURIOUS
				     (angrily)
		So what else has Superman got?

					SHOVELER
		He's got the fact that he's Superman!

					BOWLER
		Bullets bounce off him!

Furious sulks again, feeling that the others are turning against him.

					RAJA
		Firepower costs money.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Anybody got any?

A silence.

					SHOVELER
		We didn't think this through very well.

					BOWLER
				(after a moment)
		My father had this friend... He was an inventor...

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

Our heroes stand looking at an old farubouse.  The place is an absolute 
wreck.  It hasn't been painted in twenty-five years. Windows are 
boarded up.  Half the shingles are gone.  There's visible fire damage 
around the kitchen window.

					SHOVELER
		Are you sure he's still lives here?

					RAJA
		Are you sure he's still alive?

					BOWLER
		He was the last time I saw him.

					SHOVELER
		When was that?
	
					BOWLER
		I was eight.

She is about to knock, but the door is suddenly yanked open, and an 
eighty year old guy is standing there.  He's got a wild head of white 
hair (that looks like a living explosion), and he wears a stained old 
lab coat with stickum mtssages to himself stuck to it, non-matching 
slippers, and a pair of thick glasses with frames that have been 
composited of half a dozen different old pairs all taped and welded 
together into a fantastic concoction.  He is DOC HELLER.

					HELLER
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		Doctor Heller?

					HELLER
				(doesn't recognize her)
		Yes!

					BOWLER
		It's me... Elizabeth.

					HELLER
		Elizabeth!  Little Elizabeth!  Why you're so... 
		middle aged!

					BOWLER
		Thanks.

					HELLER
		How's your dad?

					BOWLER
		He's dead.

					HELLER
		Oh that's right--they squished him...  Heck of 
		a guy.

Furious throws a look at the Shoveler and Raja.  This guy's out of it.  
They're wasting their time.

					BOWLER
		Doc, these are my friends.  We're superheroes, 
		and we need your help.

					HELLER
		Well, I give to the United Way, and I feel that 
		sort of covers--

					SPHINX
		Doctor, we need your weapons.

					HELLER
				    (ecstatic)
		My weapons? You need my weapons?

EXT.  BEHIND THE HOUSE - A MINUTE LATER - MOVING ANGLE

as Doctor Heller leads them all briskly across his overgrown yard 
toward... the barn.

					HELLER
		The military establishment has never understood 
		me.  They won't return my phone calls, much 
		less field test anything.  But I knew that 
		someday I'd get my chance, and now... here you 
		are!
			   (pulls open the barn door)

INT.  THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

As our heroes step into Heller's laboratory/arsenal.  A stack of small 
aluminum cans lines one wall.  There are weird lookinq sprayers, tubes, 
and strange homemade toy-like devices... but there isn't a firearm in 
sight.

					RAJA
		But, Doc... where's the machine guns?

					SHOVELER
		The bazookas?

					INVISIBLE BOY
		The lasers?

					HELLER
		You don't need that junk!  You see, for 
		thousands of years mankind has been immolating, 
		disemboweling, and exploding itself.  Why?  
		Because we have this built-in screwed up need 
		to go to war!
					(more)

					HELLER (Cont'd)
		So as a young man I thought, why nat have the 
		fun and excitement of war, without all that 
		unnecessary bloodshed.  That's why I have 
		devoted my life to developing an arsenal of 
		highly sophisticated non-lethal military 
		weapons.
				(points to a hand held tube)
		Air cannons... Blame throwers... Feet seeking 
		missiles... And perhaps my ultimate 
		invention...
	   		   (picks up one of the small cans)
		The canned tornado.

Furious groans, and the others share a look.  This guy's really a nut.

					HELLER
		Now here's a beauty!
			(picks up a purple and orange sprayer
			that looks like a suped up water gun)
		I call it the Shrinker!  I developed it after 
		years of studying the worst dry cleaners I 
		could find.  It instantly shrinks fabrics to 
		half their size.  Anyone caught in its spray is 
		immediately immobilized by their own clothing!

					FURIOUS
		Let's get out of here.

Furious turns and goes out, and the others start to follow. But the 
Bowler picks up a canned tornado.

OUTSIDE THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

as Furious walks away, the Bowler steps out of the barn.

					BOWLER
		Hey, Mister Bad Mood.

Furious stops, turns back.

					BOWLER
			(pulls the ring on the can)
		Catch.

She tosses the can to him.  He catches it--just as a small angry 
tornado FUNNELS out of the can.  It catches Furious and lifts him high 
in the air... then dissipates to nothing...

A beat later Furious lands on the ground with a painful thump.

ON THE OTHERS, amazed.

Furious gets to his feet, unhurt, but really pissed off.  He starts 
back toward the barn, violently kicking the empty can. The others get 
out of his way, as, muttering angrily to himself, he goes back into the 
barn...

And emerges a moment later, toting the air cannon.

					HELLER
		He's got the air cannon!

The others think he's going to use it on them and scatter for cover. 
but Furious steps out into the yard, looking for a suitable target... 
He sees an old abandoned outhouse, puts the air cannon to his shoulder, 
aims, and fires...

There is a loud WHOOOOMPH of compressed air, and the huge recoil of the 
cannon instantly flings Furious back against the wall of the barn.  But 
the big rush of air hits the shed dead center... and BLOWS IT TO 
PIECES, leaving only the old seat.

Furious gets up, dusts himself off, and moves to Doc Heller.

					FURIOUS
		Doc, you're a genius!
				     (hugs him)

					HELLER
		I know.

					FURIOUS
				(turns to the others)
		Okay! We got the firepower!  I say we throw it 
		into the car, drive over to Casanova's house, 
		and kick some ass!

					SPHINX
		No.

The others ignore Furious and listen to the Sphinx.

					SPHINX
		We are not yet ready.  Now we must learn to 
		fight together... as one thing.

The others nod in agreemnt... while Furious fumes.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - TRAINING AT THE FARM

CLOSE ON DOC HELLER aiming his air cannon... CAMERA PULLS BACK TO 
REVEAL our heroes (minus Furious) standing in a pack right behind him, 
holding him down. HE fires, and the recoil jolts them all violently, 
but it doesn't knock them over...

as half a dozen scarecrows are blown to pieces... Our heroes chieer and 
shake their fists... while Mr. Furious sits alone on the sidelines, 
drinking bourbon, and feeling very alienated.

VARIOUS SHOTS as our heroes learn to fight as a team... crawling across 
the grass together....charginq in a line... hurling canned tornadoes... 
while Furious sits it out, brooding, drinking, and getting very jealous 
of the Sphinx.

Shoveler, Bowler, and the Sphinx stand shoulder to shoulder, as 
Invisible Boy, Spleen, Raja, and the Doc throw small stones at them... 
They deflect the pebbles with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... 
Theyre having fun.  They're becoming a team...

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE BARN - EVENING

Furious drinks alone, while the rest of our heroes sit around an old 
picnic table, feasting on sodas and pizza (like a football team after a 
great practice.)  Raja explains the history of the situation to the 
Sphinx.

					RAJA
		Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this 
		city were united into one great brotherhood of 
		evil, and Casanova was their king.

					SHOVELER
		Crime was rampant.  It wasn't safe to stay in 
		your home.

					BOWLER
		Much less go outside.

					SHOVELER
		Then Captain Amazing appeared.

					RAJA
		He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.

					SHOVELER
		And this has been a pretty nice place to live 
		ever since.

					FURIOUS
				    (pissed off)
		But now Casanova's back!  And we're gonna sit 
		around here all night eating pizza and telling 
		stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!

					SPHINX
		The wise snake coils before he strikes.

					FURIOUS
				(lunges at the Sphinx)
		And a skunk stinks!

Furious and the Sphinx square off, their faces only inches apart.

					SPHINX
		You drink too much.

					FURIOUS
		When are you going to take off that mask?

					SPHINX
				    (pointedly)
		When I am sure I am among friends.

					RAJA
		Roy--

					FURIOUS
				(snapping at him)
		Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!

ON THE RAJA, hurt.

					SPHINX
		Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds 
		you to your heart.

					FURIOUS
		My heart died a long time ago.

					SPHINX
		It is not dead.  It is hiding.

					FURIOUS
		Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to 
		hell with the rest of you!... Look at you.  
		Bunch of rejects.  I didn't need you before--
		and I don't need you now!
			(jumps on to his motorcycle)
		The great ones RIDE ALONE!
			(kicks the engine started)
		Adios, muchachos!
			(and he rides off across the field)

ON THE OTHERS, watching him...

					BOWLER
		Has he always been like this?

EXT.  COUNTRY ROAD - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

the wind whipping against his face, as he rides his Harley at about a 
hundred miles an hour... The languorous sound of an OLD DEAN MARTIN 
SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

MENORY SEQUENCE - DAY - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

as a little boy, sitting in the backseat of the family car. It is 
thirty years ago, and Mister Furious is a sweet, very shy, well 
behaved, perfectly normal three year old.  His MOTHER and FATHER sit in 
the front.  Dean Martin is playing on the car radio.  Little Furious 
looks out the window and sees the Mohave Desert going by.  A sign reads 
"Las Vegas, 120 miles".

					MOTHER
				   (to husband)
		Oh this place looks great.

An old sign reads "BAR" as the family car pulls into the parking lot of 
a single adobe building out in the middle of nowhere.  They park.

					MOTHER
		Now honey, you just wait in the car.  Mommy and 
		Daddy will be right beck.

They get out, lock the car and head for the bar, leaving the windows 
up.  Little Furious watches them go, never suspecting that his entire 
life is about to change.  He sits quietly in the backseat and plays 
with the little superhero figurines that he's brought with him.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Pow!  Bang!  Wham!

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

as the parents enter.  A very Western motif.  An old Gene Autrey song 
is playing on the juke.  The air conditioning is on.	They're the only 
customers in the place.

					MOTHER
		It's nice and cool in here.

					FATHER
				(as they sit at the bar)
		Barkeep, a couple of cold ones.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN CAR AND BAR -

ANGLE ON THE MIDDAY SON - blazing down on the car...

as Little Furious still plays with his superheroes, but the interior is 
starting to bake, and the sweat begins to pour ofr him.  He looks out 
at the bar. gettinq worried.  He tries the windows, but they're 
automatic and won't open...

Back in the bar his parents down shots of bourbon with their beers, as 
the BARTENDER finishes telling them a joke.

					BARTENDER
		And here's a banana for your monkey.

Mom and Dad have a good laugh.

					BARTENDER
		Couple more?

					FATHER
		You bet.

ANGLE FROM OUTSIDE TUE CAR as Little Furious, sweat and tears pouring 
out of him, his hair wet and sticking out (and starting to take on that 
familiar look), pounds on the window.

					LITTLE FURIOUS
		Mommy!  Daddy!  Mommy!  Daddy!

as back in the bar his parents, now very drunk, down more beers and 
chasers as they play a spirited game of pinball.

ANGLE ON THE MOHAVE SUN - beating down mercilessly

barely able to breath, Little Furious flops back onto the seat, his 
face a mask of heat and terror... But suddenly, a change begins to take 
place in him, as some primordial defense mechanism kicks in... and his 
fear begins to give way to rage... His teeth bare.

CLOSE ON HIS HANDS -

as they CRUSH the superhero figurines in their grasp...

While back in the bar his drunken parents dance a slow two step to Hank 
Williams "Your Cheatin' Heart"...

EXT.  TBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT - HANK WILLIAMS CONTINUES

as the big desert moon shines down on the family car, still parked 
there.

INSIDE THE BAR - CONTINUOUS

The parents are asleep in a booth.  Furious' mother wakes up, looks 
around groggily, and in a moment of horror suddenly remembers...

					MOTHER
		OH MY GOD!

THE PARKING LOT - A BEAT LATER

as she runs toward the car, hysterical.

					MOTHER
		Oh my God!  Oh my God!  Oh my God!

She unlocks the door, throws it open, and sees something that makes her 
pull back in horror... Little Furious sits in the backseat.  His hair 
sticks out wildly, his face has become that now familiar mask of 
prisordial rage.  Another OLD DEAN MARTIN SONG is heard as we...

FADE INTO:

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON FURIOUS

sitting alone in the booth, a look of profound pain and lonliness on 
his face; he is still that little boy.  The Dean Martin song is playing 
on the juke.

					MONICA (0.S.)
		Hi.

He looks up and sees Monica.

					FURIOUS
		Hi.

					MONICA
		Alone tonight?

					FURIOUS
		Every night.

She smiles.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN MANSION - CONTINUOUS

Armed Disco Boys guard the front entrance...

While on the hillside above Invisible Boy (looking through binoculars) 
and the Spleen lie together on their bellies in the weeds, keeping the 
mansion under surveillance.

					SPLEEN
				  (in a whisper)
		Adolescence was the worst--The other kids made 
		fun of me, so I'd spit on them and they'd 
		scatter--I've never had a girlfriend--unless 
		you count that night with my cousin--She 
		recovered fully though--We exchange cards every 
		Christmas--Well, I send her one, and she sends 
		it back...
			(spritzes somathing into his mouth,
			then offers it to Invisible Boy)
		Bug repellent?

Suddenly, the gates of the mansion open and several sedans... followed 
by a truck, drive out...

POV THROUGH BINOCULARS -

Casanova and Anabel sit in the front of the truck.

					INVISIBLE BOY (0.S.)
		Where are they going?

Invisible Boy hesitates for just a momnt, then gets up and runs down 
the hill.

					SPLEEN
				(runs after him)
		Kid!

As the small convoy drives past, Invisible Boy slips out from behind 
some trees, runs after the truck, jumps up and sits on its rear bumper.  
The Spleen comes running after him, and Invisible Boy reaches out, 
grabs his hand and pulls him up alongside him.  Invisible Boy tries the 
rear gate.  It's open. The two of them pull it up just a foot, squirm 
inside, then pull it closed behind them.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

Invisible Boy flashes the light of his key chain flashlight around the 
inside of the truck.  There is nothing in it, except for a large pile 
of packing blankets.

EXT.  WATERFRONT AREA - NIGHT

as the convoy drives through Champion City's seedy waterfront area and 
out onto a long pier.

INT.  THE DINER - NIGHT - CLOSE ON THE TV

Dawn Wong and Don Stouffer report the night's news.

					DAWN
		...still no sign of millionaire Lance Hunt, and 
		now, in an unrelated story, another one of 
		Champion City's leading citizens has apparently 
		disappeared. Captain Amazing has not been seen 
		or heard from in a week. Authorities believe 
		that the hard working superhero may just be 
		taking a well deserved rest.

					DON
		Cancun perhaps?

					DAWN
		Sounds good to me, Don.

Mr. Furious sits in the booth drinking coffee as Monica serves him his 
burger and fries.

					FURIOUS
				   (floundering)
		Monica... I was wondering if--uh-maybe we--I 
		mean you and I--could-uh--you know--get a--I 
		mean have a...

					MONICA
		Date?

					FURIOUS
		Yeah.

					MONICA
		I get off work in fifteen minutes. Walk me 
		home?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

					MONICA
		That was easy.
				(goes back to work)

ON FURIOUS, feeling a whole lot better.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - UNKNOWN POV

from across the street.  Furious' head is clearly visible in the 
brightly illuminated window of the diner.

A Disco Boy stands in the shadows, gazing at the diner; he recognizes 
Furious.

EXT.  WATERFRONT - NIGHT

The convoy has pulled up alongside a rusty old freighter, docked at the 
pier.

Casanova's men throw the gate of the truck open, and the CAMERA MOVES 
IN.  No one is there, but we notice... two large lumps under the 
packing blankets.

Casanova holds Anabel in his arms as they watch a large wooden crate 
being lowered from the deck of the freighter.

					CASANOVA
		Honey, our ship's come in.

Casanova's cellular phone rings.

OUTSIDE THE DINER - CONTINUOUS

The Disco Boy is on his phone.  His pistol is drawn, and he's got it 
aimed right at Furious' head.

					DISCO BOY
		Just give me the word.

BACK TO THE PIER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

					CASANOVA
				   (gets an idea)
		Wait.  I'll be right there.
				(hangs up, starts off)

					ANABEL
				     (peeved)
		Where are you going?

					CASANOVA
		Head hunting.

A minute later Casanova and two or three Disco Boys drive off in one of 
the sedans... as the crate is loaded onto the truck, and the gate is 
pulled closed... and locked.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A MOMENT LATER

The engine starts up, and the truck starts to move, as Invisible Soy 
and the Spleen poke their heads out from under the packing blankets... 
They approach the crate and Invisible Boy shines his flashlight on it.  
The crate is secured with rivets and thick metal bands; there's no way 
they're going to be able to get inside it, but in the light of the 
flashlight they see...

Faded red lettering, in Russian, and the distinctive old hammer and 
sickle of the former Soviet Union.

EXT.  DIMLY LIT STREET - NIGHT

Furious walks Monica home.

					MONICA
		I admire you.

					FURIOUS
		Why?

					MONICA
		Being a superhero, wanting to save the world.  
		It's so... unselfish.

					FURIOUS
		It is?

					MONICA
		Most people just want to make money or be 
		famous or something.  But you risk everything, 
		just to help people.

					FURIOUS
				(after a moment)
		I wouldn't mind being famous.

					MONICA
		Who wouldn't?

In the shadows behind them... Casanova follows, stalking them, as 
silent as a vampire.

					MONICA
		I've never been able to figure out what to do 
		with my life, which is why I guess I'm still a 
		waitress.

					FURIOUS
		Nothing wrong with being a waitress.

					MONICA
		What's your real name?

					FURIOUS
		Roy.

					MONICA
		Have you always lived here?

He nods.

					MONICA
		Me too... I love this stupid old town.  It's 
		noisy.  It's smelly. It's falling apart.

					FURIOUS
		It's home.

					MONICA
		Yeah.

CASANOVA'S POV

Monica, smiling, looking lovely.

CLOSE 0N CASANOVA; he wants her...

BACK ON FURIOUS AND MONICA -

					MONICA
		I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or 
		New York, but...

					FURIOUS
		What have they got that we ain't got?

					MONICA
		Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to 
		be here when it does.

					FURIOUS
		Me, too.

					MONICA
		You don't seem very angry right now.

He shrugs.  And they kiss, very tenderly.

					MONICA
		You know what?  Underneath all that anger I 
		think there's just a little boy who wants 
		everyone to love him.

					FURIOUS
		I just want to be a superhero.

					MONICA
		That's what I mean... 'Night, Roy.

She turns and climbs the stairs of an old apartmnt building and goes 
inside, as Furious watches, feeling emotions hees not used to. He 
really likes her.  He starts walking back down the street, past a man 
sitting on the stoop.  The man looks up.  It's Casanova Frankenstein.

				CASANOVA
		Going my way?

Furious is caught completely by surprise--he takes a stand, ready to 
fight.

				CASANOVA
		Take it easy--take it easy.  I just want to 
		have a little chat... That was quite a number 
		you did on my car.  You've got a lot of 
		violence in you... and I like that in a guy.

Furious, silent.

					CASANOVA
		You know what the difference is between good 
		and evil, Roy?

Furious reacts to the fact that Casanova knows his real name.

					CASANOVA
		Evil is more fun.  When you want something, you 
		just take it, and if somebody gets in your way, 
		you kill them... You seem like a very 
		frustrated guy, Roy.  Unhappy. Unfulfilled.  
		What is it that you've always wanted, always 
		desired?  Because whatever it is, I can give it 
		to you... Fame?
				(snaps his fingers)
		Easy.  Fortune?  Even easier. Women?
					(laughs)
		The easiest of all.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS as, out of the corner of his eye, he catches movement 
in the alley across the street... he knows what it is.

					CASANOVA
		I'll let you in on a little secret, Roy.  In 
		two days this entire city will belong to me, 
		and there's not a damn thing your little pals 
		can do about it.  It's the perfect time to 
		switch teams... So what do you say?

					FURIOUS
				     (quietly)
		You're nuts.

					CASANOVA
					(flairs)
		They always call the great ones nuts.

					FURIOUS
		And the nuts always call themselves great.

					CASANOVA
				(his psychosis showing)
		Are you with me... or against me?

					FURIOUS
		Against.

					CASANOVA
		Too bad.  PLUG HIM!

Gunfire rings out from the alley as the Disco Bays step out, their 
pistols blazing.  But Furious has anticipated them.  He leaps right at 
Casanova, pins his arms in a bear hug and holds him in the line of 
fire.

					CASANOVA
		WAIT!

The Disco BQys stop firing... Furious drags Casanova back into an empty 
lot, using him as a shield.

					FURIOUS
				   (to Casanova)
		Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.

					CASANOVA
		You're dead.

					FURIOUS
		So are you!

Furious releases Casanova, then runs for it and leaps over the wooden 
wall at the end of the lot... as the Disco Boys open fire again, and 
their bullets punch holes through the wall...

Furious runs down a back street and escapes into the night.

EXT.  THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

The convoy drives up the hill toward an ominous looking structure (that 
we recognize from the model on the TV interview with Casanova earlier.)  
A high central tower rises up out of the half completed bulwarks of 
featureless concrete. It looks both totally modern and completely 
ancient, but a profound sense of evil connects both themes beautifully.

ANGLE ON a plaque that reads...  "Frankenstein Center for the 
Performing and Non-performing Arts".

The gates of the center open, and the convoy passes through.

INSIDE THE TRUCK - A NONENT LATER

Invisible Boy and the Spleen stand listening, waiting, as they feel the 
truck pull to a stop...

A moment later the gate is pulled opened... Anabel is there with 
several thuggy looking SECURITY GUARDS.

					ANABEL
		Be careful with my baby.

There are two lumps under the packing blankets again.

EXT.  LOADING DOCK - A FEW MINUTES LATER

The crate is being carried away by a forklift... A beat, and then 
Invisible Boy and the Spleen slip out of the empty truck...

And run down the road back toward the gates... which are still open.  
They're just about to pass safely through them, when a PAIR OF ARMED 
SECURITY GUARDS, step in their path, their guns pointed at thern.

					GUARD 1
		Freeze!

					GUARD 2
		Hands up!

They freeze, their hands held high.

					GUARD 2
		What are you two doing here?

Our heroes are mute.

					GUARD 1
		Not talking, eh?  That can be fixed.  Turn 
		around, start walking up the hill--

					GUARD 2
		And no funny business.

Invisible Boy and the Spleen turn, hands in the air, and start up the 
hill, the guards right behind them.

					SPLEEN
			(after a moment, to Invisible
				Boy, in a whisper)
		Pinch 'em.

Invisible Boy pinches his nostrils--and the Spleen lets out with a 
horrendous fart.  The guards gag and choke violently in the fumes as 
our heroes turn and run for it... escaping out the gates.

INT.  DOC KELLER'S LABORATORY/BARN - A LITTLE LATER

Invisible Boy and Spleen report to the others.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Whatever was in that crate... is from Russia.

The others consider this, then hear a familiar voice.

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Is there room in the pack for one more wolf?

They look up and see that Furious has just returned... The Sphinx moves 
to him.  For a moment they stand face to face...

					FURIOUS
		I was wrong... I need my friends.

Sphinx takes off his mask, revealing that he is the busboy from the 
Tacky Taco.

					SPHINX
		Amigo.

They embrace.

A few mimutes later.  The others are gathered around Furious, listening 
to his story.

					FURIOUS
		Casanova said that in two days the entire city 
		would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing 
		that we could do about it.

					BOWLER
		What did he mean?

					FURIOUS
		I dunno.

Through the window the moon is seen rising over the hillside, the 
Frankenstein Center silhouetted ominously against it. Raja, Shoveler, 
and Furious gaze at it.

					SHOVELER
		Maybe it's time we checked that place out.

					RAJA
		But how do we get in?

					FURIOUS
		(after a moment, sounding very Sphinx-like)
		We just become like the wolf... who wears the 
		sheep's clothing.

MONTAGE WITH MUSIC - THE NEXT DAY

CLASSIC DISCO ("Stayin' Alive" if we can get the rights)

Furious, Raja, and Shoveler (in street clothes) walk down the street 
together and step into the doorway of... the Salvation Army Thrift 
Shop...

Later.  CLOSE ON three pairs of legs, wearing polyester pants and 
vintage shoes (ala the classic shot from "Saturday Night Fever")... 
CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL our three heroes, dressed in full blown 
seventies attire (with vintage sunglasses), doing their best Travolta 
strut down the street...

MUSIC CONTINUES as our heroes strut their way through the gates of the 
art center, right past the security guards...

OUTSIDE THE CENTER - DAY

They climb the long stairs toward the center, which looms above them... 
then pass through the big wooden doors and into...

INT.  MAIN HALL - A MOMENT LATER

END MUSIC as our heroes move through a vast, but empty main hall... A 
small army of heavily armed security guards marches about.

					RAJA
		So where's the art?

					FURIOUS
		He hasn't stolen it yet.

					SHOVELER
		This place is built like a fortress.

					FURIOUS
		Because thats what it is.

They hear a WILD BURST OF DRUNKEN LAUGHTER echoing through the hall.

					RAJA
		What's that?

					FURIOUS
				(following the sound)
		Come on.

They approach a doorway.  The noise is coming from within.

INT.  BANQUET IIALL - A MOMENT LATER

as our heroes step inside and see... A big luncheon is in progress.  
Casanova, Anabel, and Tony P sit at the head table. The room is lined 
with banquet tables, which are filled with VICIOUS LOOKING CHARACTERS, 
drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		Oh my God... Every crook in the city is here.

ON A GROUP OF VICIOUS LOOKING BALD BIKER TYPES...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bone Heads from the South Side...

ON THREE INSIPIDLY EVIL LOOKING GUYS in hip suits...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Bland Boys from Downtown...

ON A DARK HAIRED WHITE GUY dressed as a rapper...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		Italian Ice...

ON A GUY with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his 
face...

					RAJA (O.S.)
		The Stapler...

ON TWO THUGS DRESSED AS ELVIS...

					RAJA (0.S.)
		The Elvis Brothers.

A more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. Furious 
recognizes one of the waitresses...   It's Monica.

Casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night 
before on the street with Furious.

ON ANABEL, noticing his interest.

Our heroes see Monica walking straight toward them. They turn away, 
lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous...

But as she passes them, not noticing them... Casanova approaches her.

					CASANOVA
		Excuse me.

She stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet 
away...

					CASANOVA
				(reading her name tag)
		Monica... Beautiful name.  It suits you.

CLOSE ON FURIOUS, getting jealous.

					CASANOVA
		I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I 
		couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead 
		ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".

					MONICA
		Really?

Furious growls.  Raja gives him an elbow.

					CASANOVA
		Are you an actress?

					MONICA
		Just a waitress.

					CASANOVA
		You underestimate yourself.

Mister Furious is fuming.  The strands of his perfectly coiffed disco-
do start to stand straight up.

					CASANOVA
		You know I'm writing a play--it's just a little 
		Broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that I 
		think you'd be perfect for.

					MONICA
		Really?

					CASANOVA
		I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick 
		around after the luncheon?

					MONICA
		Sure--I guess.

					CASANOVA
		Terrific.

She turns and walks into the kitchen.

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, watching her; his intentions are sinister...  He 
turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.

					CASANOVA
		What are you three doing here? This is invited 
		guests only.  Out.

Our heroes skulk out.

JUST OUTSIDE THE BANQUET HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief.

					RAJA
		That was too close.

					SHOVELER
		But we gotta find out what's going on in there.

					FURIOUS
		Hey.

Furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be 
wheeled into the hall.

BACK IN THE BANQUET HALL - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a CLOSER ANGLE, under the 
table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along...

A few minutes later, Monica steps up to the dessert table... Suddenly, 
she is yanked under.

UNDER THE TABLE - CONTINUOUS

Monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over 
her mouth.

					FURIOUS
		It's me.

She calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.

					MONICA
		What are you guys doing here?

				  RAJA & SHOVELER
		Shhhh!

The waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung 
closed, and the cigars are lit.  The meeting has begun. Casanova takes 
the podium.

					CASANOVA
		Thank you all for coming.  I hope you enjoy the 
		cigars.  I had to kill a dozen Cubans to get 
		them.

Tony P chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with 
the rest of the crowd.

					CASANOVA
		Twenty years ago, this town was yours!  AND I 
		WAS YOUR KING!

ON THE HOODS, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad 
old story.

					CASANOVA
				    (tragically)
		But they called me a psycho, and they put me 
		away.  For twenty years I rotted in my cell, 
		painting watercolors, writing haikus--just 
		waiting for the day I could take my revenge.  
		Well, brothers, that day has come!

ON OUR HEROES under the table, listening.  Monica begins to realize 
what's going on.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

					CASANOVA
		They thought I was crazy? Well the joke's on 
		them--because tonight at precisely midnight--on 
		the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest--
		every man, woman, and child in this city is 
		going to turn into a RAVING PSYCSOTIC!  Mothers 
		will murder their tots!  Old ladies will 
		strangle their cats!  Children will bump off 
		their babysitters!

The guests think Casanova's completely lost it.  Italian Ice speaks up.

					ITALIAN ICE
		You're outta your mind!

					CASANOVA
		I beg your pardon?

					ITALIAN ICE
		Nobody could drive a whole city crazy.

					CASANOVA
		Tell you what, Ice.  I'll mke you a friendly 
		little wager.  It I can't do it... you can blow 
		my brains out.  If I can, I'll blow out yours.

Now the hoods' interest has been perked.

					ITALIAN ICE
		Done.

					CASANOVA
			(to Anabel, with a smile)
		Honey, give the boys a taste.

Anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors, 
then presses a button on a small remote control device.

ANGLE ON A SPEAKER, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly 
filled with a weird, stridulating, HORRIFIC NOISE (somewhere between 
the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and 
everyone in the room (except Anabel) goes COMPLETELY BERSERK...

CAMERA PANS the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, 
gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other...

Under the serving table our heroes go crazy...

Casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and 
empties it into Italian Ice... who drops to the floor, dead.

Anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and 
everything returns to normal.  The entire event lasted only a few 
seconds, but the guests are dazzled.

					CROOKS
		That was great!... What the hell was that?... 
		How did you do that?

Casanova throws Anabel a kiss.

					CASANOVA
		Tonight, at midnight, that sound will be 
		amplified across this entire city.  Murder and 
		mayhem will reign supreme!  And Champion City 
		will be ours again!  This will be our castle!  
		And I will be our king!  And there's no one to 
		stop us!

Suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.

					AMAZING (O.S.)
		Not so fast, Casanova!

A pair of curtains suddenly part... and Captain Amazing (looking a bit 
singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose.

CAMERA PANS the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to 
terror.  They yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table, 
throw up their hands in surrender, etc... But Casanova just grins.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, fellas...
			(moves to Captain Amazing, and
		puts his arm chummily around him)
		I killed him... and I've had him stuffed.

Casaova reaches behind Captain Amazing's back and pulls a string (like 
the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).

					AMAZING
				(in a canned voice)
		Isn't my butt cute in these tights?
				   (pulls again)
		Blue is my color.
				   (pulls again)
		Oh, my abs are killing me!

The crooks are beside themselves with laughter.

ON OUR HEROES, under the table, stunned.

ON THE ELVIS BROTHERS -

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		The King is back!

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Long live the King!

The crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music 
fills the air and Casanova dances, basking in their adoration...

And our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their 
escape...

INT.  DOC HELLER'S BARN/LAB - LATER

Our heroes and Monica pow-wow, sobered by what they have seen.

					MONICA
		What could have made such a horrible noise?

					HELLER
			  (after a moment, gravely)
		He's got the Psychostridulator.

					ALL
		The what?

					HELLER
		Ten years ago the Kremlin's top secret 
		Psychiatric Warfare Division developed a 
		prototype for a weapon that emitted a 
		fluctuating alternative frequency noise that 
		produced a violent psychotic reaction in any 
		mammal within hearing distance.  But when the 
		old Soviet Union fell the stridulator and its 
		brilliant inventor, Doctor Kopov, disappeared.

					SHOVELER
		This Kopov, what happened to him?

					HELLER
		Not him... her.

They react to that piece of news, and then the Bowler opens up the 
newspaper.

					BOWLER
		Did she look like that?

CLOSE ON A PHOTO of Anabel and Casanova, announcing their wedding 
engagement.

					HELLER
		Yes.

Silence; this is bad.

					SPLEEN
				    (hopefully)
		Maybe it won't work.

					FURIOUS
		It works.

					HELLER
		A village in Siberia was wiped out when a 
		cleaning woman switched it on by mistake.

Another grim silence, as they realize how desperate the situation is.  
For the first time, they're really scared.

					MONICA
		We've got to warn the city.

					SHOVELER
		How?

					RAJA
		No one will believe us.

					BOWLER
		They'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.

CAMERA CUTS BETWEEN THEM as they look at each other--their frightened 
faces, their sad, faded costuznes.  Even the Sphinx looks scared.

					FURIOUS
			   (after a moment, grimly)
		We know what we gotta do.

They look at him.

					RAJA
		We're outnumbered twenty to one.

					SHOVELER
		It's suicide.

					FURIOUS
		Maybe.  But this isn't about living or dying.  
		It's about good versus evil, and we're good, 
		whether we like it or not... Maybe we look a 
		little funny...

ON THE SPLEEN...

					FURIOUS
		And smell a little funny.  We're not 
		bulletproof and we can't fly. But we're 
		superheroes--and that means doing what's right-
		-even when it's impossible... This is our city-
		-these are our friends, our famlies--and if we 
		don't save them, nobody will!  So I say we take 
		a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, 
		destroy that Psycho-whatchamabob-- and teach 
		those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!

					SPHINX
		Now you're talking.

					BOWLER
		Sounds good to me.

					RAJA
		Let's do it.

					SHOVELER
		And we'll take a bunch of 'em with us!

They're all with him.  Monica steps forward.

					MONICA
		I just want you guys to know--I may not be a 
		superhero, but I'm with you--and I want to 
		help!

					ALL
		Oh that's great... Thanks, Monica...  (Etc.)

					BOWLER
		We could really use some coffee--

					SHOVELER
		And some sandwiches--

					SPLEEN
		With mustard!

					MONICA
			(her feelings a little hurt)
		Sure.

A few minutes later, Monica serves sandwiches and coffee as our heroes 
plan...

					RAJA
		But that place is huge and we don't know where 
		this psycho thing is--

					BOWLER
		Or even what it looks like.

					HELLER
		And he must have it well hidden.

					FURIOUS
		We'll just have to get lucky.

ON MONICA as she gets an idea.  A moment later she slips a canned 
tornado into her purse... as the others put their arms around each 
other in a group huddle\embrace.

					FURIOUS
		Go do what you gotta do.  We'll meet back here 
		at sunset... Do or die.

					ALL
		Do or die.

					SPHINX
		Victoria o morte.

HEROIC MUSIC as...

EXT.  AUTO DEMOLITION YARD - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE ON

THE FRONT GRILL of the Herkimer Battle Jitney... as Mister Furious 
hooks it up to the "Sally's Auto Demolition" tow truck... A moment 
later he drives the tow truck, towing the off the lot, as Sally steps 
out of her office, pissed off...

					SALLY
		HEY!

EXT.  HELLER'S FARM - DAY

ON THE SPHINX, standing as immobile and silent as a statue... as a 
falling leaf slowly flutters down in front of him... In a flash, his 
machete slices through the air, and the leaf continues fluttering down, 
but in two pieces...

INT.  LABORATORY/BARN - DAY

Doc Heller fine tunes his Shrinker spray... as the Bowler sits quietly 
in the hayloft, studying the old dog eared photo of her father and 
herself as a little girl...

INT.  INVISIBLE BOY'S ROOM - DAY

Invisible Boy stands in front of his mirror, eyes closed, concentrating 
for all he's worth, trying to become invisible...  He suddenly pops 
opens his eyes and looks at himuself in the mirror... but he's still 
completely visible. He flops onto his bed in frustration.

INT.  THE DINER - DAY

CLOSE ON A TABLE full of food... Eggplant Parmesan, broccoli, chili... 
CAKERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Spleen sitting alone in the booth, 
stuffing his face, gassing up for battle.

INT.  THE SHOVELER'S HOUSE - DAY

The Shoveler, standing in his bedroom, has just put on his freshly 
laundered suit.  CAMERA OPENS WIDE TO REVEAL Lucille, his wife, 
standing there, holding his just polished shovel. He takes it from her, 
then takes her in his arms.

					SHOVELER
		Baby, if I don't make it... find yourself... a 
		normal guy.

					LUCILLE
		I don't want a normal guy.

And they kiss.

A few minutes later... In the living room the Shoveler's kids lie 
sprawled in front of the television.  The Shoveler, in battle array, 
steps into the room.  Be wants to say something to them, but the kids 
don't even take their eyes off the TV look at him... He turns and walks 
out in silence.

END MUSIC...

INT.  THE RAJA'S DINING ROOM - DAY

The shades are drawn.  The Raja, in full costume, quietly loads 
silverware into the secret pockets of his cape. Suddenly, the light 
switches on... It's his mother.  She's caught him red handed.

					MOTHER
		Jeffrey, YOU THIEF!

					RAJA
		Mother... it's not what you think!

					MOTHER
		And why are you wearing that silly costume?

					RAJA
				   (painfully)
		Because... I'M A SUPERHERO!

ON HIS MOTHER, shocked.

					RAJA
		Oh, Mother, I'm sorry.  I know how much you 
		wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a 
		family--but it's just not who I am!

					MOTHER
		But... the silverware?

					RAJA
		I use it... to fight evil.

					MOTHER
				(after a moment)
		Jeffrey... this is wonderful.

					RAJA
				    (stunned)
		It is?

					MOTHER
		I always knew that you were special.

					RAJA
		You did?

					MOTHER
		Ever since you were a little boy...
			(gets an idea, excited)
		Come with me.

INT.  UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER

She pulls down the stairway to the attic...

INT.  THE ATTIC - A MOMENT LATER

She switches on the light and leads the Raja to a far corner...  where 
she moves a couple of old hat boxes, REVEALING an ancient leather bound 
box with the word "Excalibur" engraved in gold on the top.

					MOTHER
		This is for you.

The Raja opens the box and registers astonisha~nt as he sees...

A FABULOUS VICTORIAN SILVER SET packed with formidable looking servers, 
cake knives, ice cream forks.

					MOTHER
		Your Great Great Grandmother's wedding silver.

The Raja lifts up and handles a large heavily engraved pie server.

					RAJA
		Bitchin'.

EXT.  OUTSIDE HELLER'S BARN/LAB - EVENING - CLOSE ON

Mister Furious, wrench in hand, covered with grease and oil, cussing to 
himself as he works under the hood of the Herkimer.

					FURIOUS
		Try it again!

Invisible Boy, sitting behind the wheel, tries the ignition of the 
Herkimer, and the old engine grinds as it turns over, but doesn't 
catch.

					FURIOUS
		Come on, baby... Come on, baby... I SAID COME 
		ON!

Mister Furious SLUGS the engine with his fist, and it sputters and 
backfires into life... shaking, rattling, leaking, exploding, but 
running... Furious kisses the Herkimer... as the Bowler calls out to 
him from the barn.

					BOWLER
		Mon Capitan, it's for you.
				(tosses him the phone)

					FURIOUS
		Hello?

EXT.  UNKNOWN LOCATION - EVENING - CLOSE ON MONICA

					MONICA
			(on a phone, speaking very softly)
		It's me.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

					FURIOUS
		Monica, where are you?

BACK TO MONICA - WIDER ANGLE

REVEALING that she is on a pay phone just outside the art center.  
She's wearing make-up and a sexy little dress; she looks she's dressed 
for a date.  Disco Boys and security guards go about their business all 
around her.

					MONICA
		At the Frankenstein Center.

CUT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THEM -

					FURIOUS
		Are you nuts?  Get out of there!

					MONICA
		I'm going inside.

					FURIOUS
		What are you talking about?

					MONICA
		Listen, Casanova may be a supervillain, but 
		he's got a weakness, and I'm it.  Maybe--just 
		maybe--I can trick him into showing me the 
		location of the whatchamathing.

					FURIOUS
		He's a psycho!  He'll kill you!

					MONICA
		Just shut up and listen.  Hold off the attack 
		as long as you can.  If I can discover the 
		location I'll call you--

					FURIOUS
		And what if you get killed?

					MONICA
		Then at least I will have died trying, right?

Furious silent, taken aback by her courage.

					MONICA
		Roy... We might never see each other again, so 
		I'd better tell you now...  I think you're 
		wonderful.

					FURIOUS
			(caught completely off guard)
		What?

					MONICA
		Bye.
				(and she hangs up)

					FURIOUS
		Monica!

INT.  LOBBY OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as Monica approaches a GUARD standing by the main door.

					MONICA
		Could you tell Mr. Frankenstein that Monica is 
		here?

					GUARD
		Sure, doll.

BACK TO THE BARN - CONTINUOUS

Furious stands by the Herkimer, phone still in hand.  He seems 
speechless, dazed.  Something inside him has changed.

					BOWLER
				(worried about him)
		Hey... you okay?

					FURIOUS
		Sure.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A FEW MINUTES LATER

Casanova steps out and sees... Monica, looking very sexy.

					MONICA
		Hi.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you'd chickened out on me.

					MONICA
		Just wanted to... powder my nose.

His eyes roam all over her; he knows she's up to something, but she 
looks yummy, and this is just the sort of cat and mouse game he loves.

					MONICA
		How 'bout giving me "the tour"?

					CASANOVA
		Why not?

EXT.  COURTYARD - A FEW MINUTES LATER

as Casanova leads Monica across an open courtyard toward... the sheer 
walls of the imposing central tower.

					CASANOVA
		Big, isn't it?

He leads her to a massive archway, the only apparent entrance to the 
tower.  But just as she is about to pass through, Monica looks up and 
sees something that makes her pull back with fear...

HER POV -

A very sinister looking SECURITY EYE gazes down at her from the top of 
the archway.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry.  It's not activated.

They pass through and into...

INT.  ROOM IN THE BASE OF TOWER - CONTINUOUS

which is filled with IMMENSE BRONZE SCULPTURES of voluptuous, scantily 
clad females in various poses of bondage.  Monica reacts; these things 
are scary.

					MONICA
		Who's the artist?

					CASANOVA
		Me.

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - NIGHT

The Bowler, Spleen, Invisible Boy, and Doc Heller load up the Herkimer 
with Heller's weaponry...

as Mister Furious lies sprawled on the hillside... breathing in the 
night air, contemplating a dandelion gone to seed, and listening to the 
sounds of the night.  The Raja, Shoveler, and Sphinx, stand nearby, 
watching, trying to figure out what's wrong with him.  A whippoorwill 
is heard singing.

					FURIOUS
		Listen.  He's lonely... and he doesn't care who 
		knows it.

Raja and Shoveler share a bewildered look.  The bird sings again.

					FURIOUS
		We're all the same really.  Our songs, our 
		dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt 
		to live forever.
			(blows the dandelion seeds into the wind)

					SPHINX
		He is in love.  His anger is gone.

					RAJA
		Oh no.

					SHOVELER
		Great timing!
	
					FURIOUS
		Has Monica called?

INT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova leads Monica into... a palatial room, filled with priceless 
objects d'art, all of which reflect Casanova's dark psyche.  A Munch 
painting.  Mayan idols.  Weird German furniture.  A huge glass 
chandelier hovers over the room.  A massive bronze sculpture of a wolf 
(done in the same style as the other sculptures) is perched in the 
balcony.  It seems to be howling out over the city which is seen in a 
spectacular view, spread out alonq the lakeshore below.

					CASANOVA
		This is where I come to... be alone.

He turns down the lights and quietly closes and locks the big door to 
the room.

CLOSE ON MONICA, sensing her danger.

					MONICA
		Oh, look at that view.

She moves out onto the balcony... as Casanova slips the gold chain from 
around his neck and follows her.

INT.  BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes have gathered around Furious, who sits in a chair, getting 
the third degree.

					HELLER
		Snap out of it!

					BOWLER
		Get on to yourself!

					SHOVELER
			(shouting right in his face)
		GET MAD!

					FURIOUS
		But I just don't feel it.

					RAJA
		He's turned into a completely normal person!

					FURIOUS
		Normal.  What's normal?  Does normal exist?  
		And if it did, how would we know it?

The Shoveler slugs him, sending him sprawling.

					FURIOUS
		You know, Eddie, that was really uncalled for.

EXT.  BALCONY ON FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - ON MONICA

gazing out onto the city, as she senses Casanova slinking up behind 
her.

					MONICA
		I'm chilly.

She turns, elegantly avoiding him, and moving back inside.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Spleen holds up Furious' favorite sunglasses.

					SPLEEN
		Look!  Your favorite sunglasses!
				(snaps them in two)

					BOWLER
		Your Roy Rogers coffee mug!
			(hurls it against the wall)

					SHOVELER
		Your Spiderman Pez dispenser!
			    (breaks the head off it)

					FURIOUS
		Okay, you win.  I'm pissed off. I'm seriously 
		peeved.

The others groan with frustration.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica moves nervously around the room as Casanova sprawls languorously 
on the bed, toying with his gold chain.

					CASANOVA
		Come here.

					MONICA
		I'm not that kind of girl.

					CASANOVA
		Then why are you here?

					MONICA
		Curiosity.

					CASANOVA
				   (with a smile)
		Remember the cat.

Suddenly, he hears high heels in the hall.  A key is put in the lock--
Casanova leaps off the bed, grabs Monica and roughly shoves her into 
the closet.  He leaps back onto the bed, just as the door opens, and 
Anabel, dressed in a lab coat (and wearing high heels) enters.  
Casanova is completely relaxed, nonchalant.

					ANABEL
		What are you doing all alone in the dark?

					CASANOVA
		Fantasizing... about you.

She crosses the room to the wolf sculpture.

					CASANOVA
		I thought you were done?

					ANABEL
		One last tweak.

She opens a secret panel on its back, REVEALNG a FLASHING HIGH TECH 
INTERIOR... and Monica, watching from the closet, realizes that she has 
found the Psychostridulator.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - CLOSE ON

a boom box... A CD jacket tells us that "Kenny G." is playing...

					RAJA
		If this doesn't do it, nothing will!

ON FURIOUS, a pair of headphones on his head.  The music is so loud 
that we can hear it even though it's being played only through the 
headphones.

ON THE OTHERS, gathered around him, waiting to see if this will work.  
And then Furious begins to respond... as his face turns into a 
contorted grimace.

					BOWLER
		It's working!

Furious groans and writhes... The others are thrilled; they've done it!

					FURIOUS
		This music is just SO BEAUTIFUL!

He starts to weep.  The others give a collective groan of defeat.

BACK AT THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - COHTINUOUS

as Anabel works on the Psychostridulator, Monica looks at a clock... 
which reads almost eleven.  Time is running out.

BACK TO THE BARN/LAB - CLOSE ON SHOVELER'S WRISTWATCH

which also reads eleven.

0N SHOVELER AND RAJA -

					SHOVELER
		It's time.

					RAJA
		With or without him, we gotta go!

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER -

as Anabel closes up the wolf... and starts to leave.

					ANABEL
		Our guests are waiting.

					CASANOVA
		I'll be down in a jiffy.

She goes out.  Casanova listens as the sound of high heels fades away, 
then he goes to the closet and lets Monica out.

					MONICA
		I'd better go.

					CASANOVA
		You're a spy.

					MONICA
				    (offguard)
		What?

					CASANOVA
		I saw him walk you home.

					MONICA
		Who?

					CASANOVA
		Roy.

She makes a sudden try for the door, but he blocks her way, a cold look 
in his eye that makes her step back in fear.

					CASANOVA
		Don't be afraid... I never hit a lady...

He lets the gold chain drop loose in his hand, then starts coming for 
her, a sadistic grin on his face.  This is the real Casanova.

Monica pulls back, then reaches into her purse and takes out A CANNED 
TORNADO, which she holds out threateningly.

					MONICA
		Stay away!

					CASANOVA
		Or you'll what?  CAN ME?

He laughs dementedly as Monica pops open the can and A SWIRLING FUNNEL 
OF AIR SHOOTS OUT OF IT and ENGULFS Casanova, throwing him across the 
room... Monica grabs the handset of a cordless phone and runs out the 
door.

ON CASANOVA, pulling himself together.

					CASANOVA
		That bitch!

INT.  CORRIDOR JUST OUTSIDE - CONTINUOUS

as Monica runs for it, dialing the phone on the fly...

INT.  TEE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS - ON THE PUONE

ringing... but no one is there...

EXT.  THE BARN/LAB - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are climbing into the Herkimar, whose noisy idling engine 
obliterates the ringing of the phone.

					FURIOUS
		But she still might call!

					SHOVELER
		Are you coming or not?

					FURIOUS
		I'll drive.

					SHOVELER
		Not a chance!

He shoves him in the back, closing the heavy steel door behind him.

BACK TO THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON MONICA

hiding behind a large planter... listening to the phone ringing on the 
other end.

					MONICA
		Come on, guys... Pick up... 

Suddenly, we hear Casanova's voice on the line.

				CASANOVA'S VOICE
		What's the matter...

BACK IN THE TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is listening in on another phone.

					CASANOVA
		Nobody home?

BACK TO M0NICA - CONTINUOUS

as she moves quickly down the hall.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The Shoveler is at the wheel.  The Raja sits in the passenger seat.  
The others are in the back.

					SHOVELER
		Here we go!

He forces the stick into gear and the Herkimer lurches forward.

					SHOVELER
		We've got lift off!

					RAJA
		May the forks be with us!

EXT.  DOC HELLER'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer--backfiring, smoking, clanging--rumbles down the 
driveway into action.

BACK IN THE HERKINER - CONTINUOUS

Shoveler tries to put the car in second gear, but it won't go. He yanks 
and pulls and struggles, until the stick comes off in his hand.

					RAJA
		First is good.

INT.  CORRIDOR IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova instructs three security guards.

					CASANOVA
		I want her alive.

					GUARDS
		Yes, Mr. Frankenstein.

CAMERA PANS UP the top of a staircase... where Monica is crouched, 
listening.

EXT.  STREETS OF CHAMPION CITY - NIGHT

VARIOUS SHOTS as the Herkimer rumbles and smokes down Champion's main 
street (in first gear) and the citizens step out of houses and bars to 
watch this bizarre sight.

ON A LITTLE BOY AND HIS FATHER -

					LITTLE BOY
		Daddy, what is that thing?

					FATHER
		I don't know, son.

A couple of GRIZZLED CHARACTERS stand in front of a bar.

					DRUNK
		A Herkimer?  Those yuppies will drive anything.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

ON FURIOUS AND THE OTHERS in the back.

					SPHINX
		Amigo, we need you.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Just GET MAD!

Furious closes his eyes and tries, but it's hopeless.

INT.  V.I.P. LOUNGE IN FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

A sumptuous, hotel-like lounge.  Anabel is holding court with all of 
top crooks from the luncheon, charrning the pants off them... Casanova 
slithers up behind her.

					CASANOVA
		Fellas, this is woman without whom I would have 
		gone sane.
				(kisses her neck)

EXT.  FRONT GATE OF THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - CONTINUOUS

A pair of security guards (the same two who got gassed by the Spleen) 
are on duty, when they see... a strange looking vehicle chugging up the 
hill straight for them.

					GUARD 1
		What the hell is that?

					GUARD 2
		Looks like... a Ford Dumpster.

They have a good laugh at it, then hold up their hands for it to 
stop...  But the Herkimer just rolls past them, hitting the iron gates 
and snapping them open as if they were made of match sticks.

					GUARDS
		HEY!

They open fire.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Bullets are heard pinging off the Herk as THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD just 
ahead we see the long stairway heading up to the front door of the art 
center.

					SHOVELER
		Hang on!

EXT.  ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

Several more guards open fire, as the Herkimer hits the stairs and 
starts bouncing up them...

BACK AT THE LOUNGE - ON CASANOVA

checking his watch.

					CASANOVA
		It's showtime.

But then they all hear... the sound of gunfire.

					TONY P
		What's that?

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer chugs and bounces... toward the entrance of the center.

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes get bounced all over the place.

INT.  JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as guards close and bolt the big wooden doors to the art center.

ON A GUARD wearing a headset.

					GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, we're being attacked.

INT.  SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova sits at a security console.  Anabel, Tony P, and the top 
crooks stand behind him, listening.

					CASANOVA
		By whom?

					VOICE OF GUARD
		We don't know!

BACK ON THE STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer climbs to the top, then rams into the doors with a 
thud.  But the doors hold.

BACK ON THE VILLAINS -

					TONY P
		They'll never get through those doors.

BACK AT THE FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS

But the plucky little Herkimer digs in its rear wheels and pushes 
against the doors like the Little Engine That Could...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes encourage the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Come on, baby!

					BOWLER
		Do it, big boy!

ON ITS WHEELS, grinding, chewing up the concrete... 

JUST INSIDE THE CENTER - CONTINUOUS

as the Herkimer comes crunching through the big wooden doors of the 
center, scattering the guards.

BACK INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

our heroes cheer, pat the Herk.

					SHOVELER
		Atta, girl!

					BOWLER
		Atta, boy!

BACK TO CASANOVA -

watching on a security monitor

					VOICE OF GUARD
		Mr. Frankenstein, they're in!

					CASANOVA
		Well kill them.

BACK IN THE HALL - CONTINUOUS

The Herkimer drives into the main hall of the center as a small army of 
security guards swarms in, guns blazing.

BACK AT THE SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS

Casanova and the crooks watch the security monitor...

INSIDE THE HERKIMER - CONTINUOUS

The bullets sound like hailstones bouncing off the armor of the Herk as 
our heroes grimly prepare themselves for battle...The Sphinxs puts on 
his mask... the Bowler unzips her bag...Doc Heller cocks his air 
cannon... Spleen and Invisible Boy load a bag with canned tornadoes... 
While Mister Furious watches anxiously.

The Shoveler drives intently, bullets splattering like bugs on the 
windshield.

					SHOVELER
		Where am I going?

					RAJA
			(pointing to an archway on the
				other side of the hall)
		Through there!

					SHOVELER
		Right.

But suddenly something under the hood blows up; the engine gives a long 
groan, and the Herkimer rolls to a dead stop...

INSIDE/OUTSIDE THE HERIKINER - CONTINUOUS

Right in the middle, in the most exposed position of the main hall.  
More guards arrive and open fire... An armored golf cart with a fifty 
caliber machine gun mounted on it comes speeding into the hall, 
blasting the Herk...

Inside, the sound of the big bullets is deafening as Shoveler tries to 
restart the engine.

					SHOVELER
		No good!  She's dead!

ON CASANOVA AND THE CROOKS, watching the monitor and laughing as 
bullets pulverize the Herk.

					TONY P
		Spam in a can!

The crooks laugh.

Butsuddenly, the Herkimer's door is thrown open, revealing our heroes--
holding down Doc Heller, his air cannon at the ready. He fires--there 
is a WHOOMPH of air--and the mounted gun and a dozen guards are sent 
tumbling...

SECURITY DESK - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA AND THE OTHERS

watching, sobered.

BACK IN THE MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS

as our heroes come charging out of the Herkimer, using their various 
skills to blow through the surprised guards.  Mr. Furious comes out 
last, not quite sure what to do with himself.

But suddenly, a withering barrage of machine gun fire is being laid 
down on them by three guards firing tommy guns from a balcony 
overlooking the floor.  Bullets splatter all around them--and several 
unlucky guards are hit--but our heroes dive for cover. The Raja tries 
to get off a fork, but the firing is too intense.  Our heroes are 
pinned down.

ON MR. FURIOUS as he sees... the bag of canned tornadoes. He's got no 
superpowers, and he's scared to death, but he grabs a canned tornado.

					FURIOUS
		Cover me!

					SHOVELER
		With what?

Bullets dancing all around him, Furious runs a desperate (but 
impressive) zig-zag pattern across the floor... He performs a wild 
somersault, comes up on his feet, pops open the can, and executes a 
perfect jump shot, lobbing it right into the balcony.  The tornado 
funnels out, and the guards are sent flying.

ON CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS watching...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
		Who are those guys?

CLOSE ON CASANOVA, who knows who they are.

WHILE BACK IN THE HALL our heroes rally around a shaken Mr. Furious.

					RAJA
		Not bad for a normal guy!

					SPHINX
		Amigos!

					ALL
		Do or die!

EXT.  COURTYARD - A MOMENT LATER - ANGLE ON

the security eye watching...

as the panicking security guards retreat under it into the main tower.

BACK TO CASANOVA -

as he types something into the security computer...

ON THE SCREEN a computerized image of the eye appears. Casanova 
highlights the word "Activate" and then presses "Enter".

BACK TO THE COURTYARD - ON THE EYE

as it comes to glowing, sinister life...

A hapless guard retreats under the arch--the Eye instantly focuses on 
him, and he is hit by a dozen nasty looking laser beams... that SIZZLE 
HIM...

A moment later our heroes arrive at the arch.  Furious is about to run 
through, but Doc Heller holds him back.

					HELLER
		Wait!  Look!

He points to... a man shaped pile of charcoal, all that remains of the 
unfortunate guard.

					HELLER
		Laser eye... and it's a humdinger.

					RAJA
		No problem.

The Raja takes out a butter knife, aims, and hurls it straight at the 
eye, but laser beams intercept the knife and instantly melt it into... 
a formless blob of silver.

BACK TO CASANOVA AND THE TOP CROOKS -

					TONY P
		We'll take care of these clowns.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Piece a cake.

					BONE HEAD LEADER
		No sweat.

CORRIDOR - A MOMENT LATER

as Tony P, the top crooks, and the Disco Boys march en masse TOWARD THE 
CAMAERA... They are an ugly, formidable looking bunch.

EXT.  COURTYARD - CONTINUOUS

Our heroes are blocked by the eye.

					SHOVELER
		Doc, there's got to be a way.

But the Doc is stymied... Suddenly they hear a woman's voice calling 
down to them.

					MONICA'S VOICE
		It's up here!  It's up here!

					FURIOUS
				     (looks up)
		Monica!

EXT.  TOP OF THE FRANKENSTEIN TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Monica leans over the edge of the balcony, the wolf sculpture looming 
over her, shouting down at them.

					MONICA
		ROY!  THE PSYCHO THING IS--!

But strong hands suddenly grab her.  It's Casanova.

BACK TO FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as high above he hears Monica scream.

BACK TO THE BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

Casanova, hand held tightly across Monica's mouth, shouts down 
tauntingly to Furious.

					CASANOVA
		Thanks, Roy!  She's just my type. You can have 
		her back... when I'm done!

BACK T0 FURIOUS - CONTINUOUS

as he hears Casanova's evil laugh and Monica's scream.  He is desperate 
to find a way up, but the wall is completely sheer. He feels helpless-
frantic, near tears...

FLASH TO the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' 
car, crying, pounding on the windows...

And then... Mr. Furious' hands clench into fists--his hair stands up--
and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. His button has 
finally been pressed.  Be's MAD!  He reaches up as high as he can...

CLOSE ON HIS HAND -

as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he 
pulls himself up.

BACK AT THE TOP 0F THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova throws Monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and 
strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength.

BACK TO FURIOUS -

Fifty feet up and climbing.  He pulls himself up, one hand, then 
another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny 
cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.

					HELLER
		He'll never make it.

					BOWLER
		Think positive.

Meanwhile, Invisible Boy stands staring at the security eye, a look of 
fierce determination on his face.  This is his moment.

					INVISIBLE BOY
					(to himself)
		I can do it.

He takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates...

ON FURIOUS as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold 
gives way... For a desperate moment, Furious is dangling off the wall 
by the tips of the fingers of one hand. Only his incredible rage keeps 
his fingertips taut.

Suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in 
the concrete not far from his head.  Furious grabs hold of it, and 
throws a grateful look down to the Raja...

Who salaams up at him...

As Invisible Boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly, 
hands at his sides, in an almost Egyptian pose... toward the eye... 
which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim...

we notice that Invisible Boy has become... just slightly transparent.

AT THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles Monica.  Her resistance 
fades.  Her hands fall away.  She is pale, beautiful, almost gone, a 
picture of exquisite death.

					CASANOVA
				   (admiring her)
		Some girls just know how to die.

Suddenly, we hear someone cursing Casanova in Russian. He turns and 
sees... Anabel standing there, pistol in hand.

					ANABEL
		You two timing psychotic bastard.

					CASANOVA
		Darling, you've got the wrong idea.

					ANABEL
				(aiming at his heart)
		Do I?

					CASANOVA
		I was only strangling her... I've killed hundreds of women.  
		It doesn't mean a thing.
				(moving toward her, turning on
				that old Frankenstein Charm)
		Pootchkie, you're over-reacting. This is our 
		night.  It's what we've lied for... cheated 
		for... murdered for.  She's just a plaything, a 
		trifle... You're the only woman who's ever 
		meant anything to me. I adore you.  I worship 
		you.  I want to make you my bride.

She succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her 
hand.

					CASANOVA
		There's just one thing...
				(with a psychotic smile)
		I don't need you anymore.

A look of terror comes across her face as she sees the murder in his 
eyes.

					CASANOVA
		Don't worry, Darling.  I never hit a lady.

EXT.  ON THE WALL - A MOMENT LATER - ON FURIOUS

still climbing as he hears a scream, looks up... and sees Anabel go 
plummeting past him.

ON OUR HEROES down below.

					BOWLER
		Heads up!

CAMERA HOLDS ON OUR HEROES, wincing as Anabel hits with an ugly thud.

Suddenly they hear Invisible Boy calling to them.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Guys, I did it! I did it!  I'm invisible!

They all turn and see... Invisible Boy, totally visible, but standing 
on the other side of the arch.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Can you see me?

					ALL
		Yes!

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Nuts.

					SHOVELER
		Kid, turn that thing off!

Invisible Boy turns and sees... a computer screen built into the wall 
(with the same image of the eye on it that was on Casanova's computer), 
but he doesn't have a clue how to turn it off.  Suddenly, he hears 
running feet, turns and sees...

The top crooks and the Disco Boys rushing towards him through the giant 
sculptures.  He gets an idea... and stands right in front of the 
computer screen.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		HEY! CREEPS!

He makes a face at them--and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him.  
He jumps clear behind a pillar--as the bullets smash into the wall... 
one of them demolishing the computer screen.

CLOSE ON THE EYE -

as it goes dead.

ON INVISIBLE BOY, hiding behind the pillar... realizing he's been shot 
in the shoulder.

BACK ON OUR HEROES -

					SHOVELER
		This is it!  DO OR DIE!

The villains form a line, bristling with pistols... as our heroes, led 
by Sphinx, Shoveler, and Bowler come running through the arch.  The 
threesome go shoulder to shoulder (with our other heroes right behind 
them) as the villains open fire, laying down a deadly fusillade...

ON SHOVELER, BOWLER, AND SPHINX, standing together, deflecting their 
bullets with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... (as they practiced 
with pebbles at the farm)... with the Raja right behind them, hurling 
silverware...

ON THE VILLAINS, rapid firing... but their own bullets ricochet back 
into them, dropping them... They start to fall back.

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Casanova is about to finish Monica.

					CASANOVA
		And the light goes out...

					FURIOUS (0.S.)
		Frankenstein!

Casanova turns and sees... Furious, standing on the balcony.

					CASANOVA
		Roy... What took you so long?

Furious starts at Casanova, who aims Anabel's pistol at him. Furious 
hesitates.

					CASANOVA
		Let me guess... Bullets don't hurt you.

					FURIOUS
		They hurt... BUT THEY DON'T STOP ME!

Furious lunges at Casanova--who gets off a shot before Furious grabs 
the gun out of his hand.  Casanova ducks clear.  Furious tosses the 
pistol away... then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.

					CASANOVA
		Smarts, doesn't it?... Shall we dance?

He turns on his stereo and the sound of DISCO MUSIC fills the air...

INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO FIGHTS - CONTINUOUS

Downstairs, the villains have regrouped.

					TONY P
		Let's rush 'em!

They charge en mass at our heroes... who are waiting for them... 
pinching their noses closed, the Spleen bent over at their forefront...

While Casanova dances around Furious like a cat... Furious, fighting 
the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and Casanova neatly 
sidesteps him...

The crooks and Disco Boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious 
fumes...

As Casanova attacks...

Advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield 
machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the 
villains back...

Casanova comes at Furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning...  and 
Furious gets the worst of it.

Suddenly, a squad of Disco Boys comes charging at our heroes from the 
flank... but Doc Heller turns to face them, shrinker spray held Rambo-
style on his hip.  He lets them have it, blasting them with a DENSE 
BLUE SPRAY...

When the spray clears, the D Boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners 
in their now child sized disco suits...

					DISCO BOYS
		Help!... Get me out of this!
				        (Etc.)

Upstairs, Casanova pummels Furious...

While, downstairs, the Shoveler dispatches the Elvis Brothers with some 
nifty shovel work... But suddenly, the Bland Boys, pistols blazing, are 
advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture.  
But the Raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.

					RAJA (0.S.)
		Gentlemen!

The Bland Boys look up and see... the Raja, both hands filled with 
silverware... which he HURLS...

A beat later the Bland Boys, bristling with forks and grapefruit 
spoons, run screaming through the sculptures... as Tony P, pistol in 
hand, skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots... the Bowler.

Upstairs, Furious goes flying against a wall...

					CASANOVA
		Roy, you're making this too easy.

As Tony P takes a careful bead on the Bowler.

					TONY P
		Say hello to Daddy for me!

He opens fire, but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy... 
He fires, missing--she's too fast to keep a bead on... Finally, his gun 
clicks empty.  She turns and faces him.

					BOWLER
				     (grimly)
		Daddy says hello.

She HURLS the ball at him--like a fiery softball pitch.

BALL'S POV -

going straight for Tony P's SCREAMING head...

ON THE BOWLER, watching--as Tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose 
thud.

Back upstairs Casanova cornmes at Furious again... but Furious ducks 
the kick, pops back up and smashes Casanova with his good arm... 
sending him flying across the room... Casanova recovers.

					CASANOVA
		Let's change the tune.

He reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device (that Anabel 
used at the luncheon).  He presses a button...

ON THE WOLF SCULPTURE as the jaws open, its eyes glow red... and the 
dreadful sound of the Psychostridulator grinds up and FILLS THE NIGHT 
AIR LIKE A SIREN.

Downstairs, the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the 
villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode... The villains 
start shooting and stabbing each other.

SERIES OF SHOTS - AROUND THE CITY - CONTINUOUS

On Main Street cars slam into each other.  Pedestrians start screaming 
and fightinq... A man and his dog snarl and snap at each other...

The Customers at the Lakeside Diner go insane, hurling plates and 
food...

At the Shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the 
television...

ANGLE ON A TYPICAL SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD -

as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be 
heard coming from all the houses...

LONG ANGLE OF CHAMPION CITY -

as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS - ON CASANOVA

in full psychotic ecstasy...

					CASANOVA
		WHAT A RUSH!
			(tosses the remote off the balcony)

ON MONICA, still motionless on the bed...

Casanova and Furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a 
contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... Casanova gets 
his hands around Furious's throat and crushes it... Furious drops to 
his knees, and Casanova thinks he's got him.  But Furious, grimacing 
with rage, looks him right in the eye.

					FURIOUS
				   (raspy voiced)
		Is... that... all you got?

Furious grabs Casanova's wrists... and crushes them.  Casanova howls 
with pain, loses his grip.  Furious slugs him, again and again... then 
he grabs Casanova by the belt, swings him around, and HURLS him into 
the air...

Casanova CRASHES into the huge crystal chandelier--there is an 
explosion of crystal and glass.  Furious averts his eyes as cut glass 
rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees...

Casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier.  
Casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own 
gold chain...

Furious moves to the wolf sculpture.  Be PLUNGES HIS HAND through its 
bronze casing, and RIPS OUT the heart of the Psychostridulator, a 
flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but 
higher pitched and more irritating sound...

Furious HURLS the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a 
thousand pieces...

CLOSE ON ONE OF THE PIECES -

In insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more 
disorienting sound.  This is the very nerve center of the 
Psychostridulator...

Furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...

SILENCE...

Furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... He looks up... at 
Casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...

					FURIOUS
		Nice dancing with you.

SERIES OF SHOTS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - CONTINUOUS

as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished 
crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it. Things also 
return to normal...

On the street...

At the Lakeside Diner...

And at the Shoveler's house...

BACK TO THE TOP OF THE TOWER - CONTINUOUS

Furious moves to the bed, where Monica lies motionless and pale...

					FURIOUS
		Monica...

He touches her face, her eyes open, and she looks at him.

					MONICA
		You're beautiful when you're angry.

He takes her tenderly in his arm... as the Raja, the Shoveler and the 
others rush into the room and see... Furious and Monica embracing.

EXT.  OUTSIDE THE FRANKENSTEIN CENTER - A LITTLE LATER

Police cars and news vans arrive... as our heroes, battered, wounded, 
but victorious walk proudly down the long stairs...

Furious and Monica hold each other up.  Wounded Invisible Boy has his 
arm around the Spleen... while policemen and news people run up the 
stairs past them into the center, ignoring them as always...

But this time our heroes could care less.  They are superheroes, and 
they don't give a damn who knows it.

INT.  THE RAJA'S HOUSE - NIGHT

as the Raja opens the door and enters...

					RAJA
		Mama!

She is there, waiting up for him.

					RAJA
		I'm home.

They embrace.

INT. SHOVELER'S DOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN

Don Stouffer is reporting.

					DON
		Few details have emerged...

ON THE SHOVELER'S KIDS, on the couch, still rattled by their psychotic 
episode, glued to the TV -

					DON (0.S.)
		...but the Dawn Patrol got this exclusive 
		interview vith two of the suspects.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong interviews the battered, handcuffed Elvis Brothers as they 
are led away...

					ELVIS BROTHER I
		I don't know who those guys were--but I never 
		want to see 'em again.

					ELVIS BROTHER 2
		Especially that big dude with the shovel...

					ELVIS BROTHER 1
					 (near tears)
		He was the worst!

ON THE KIDS' COLLECTIVE REACTION as they realize who it was... and then 
they hear the front door open...

In the front hall the Shoveler enters wearily; his shoulder hurts, his 
back is killing him... as his kids come running to him.

					KIDS
		Dad!... Dad!... You okay?... You hurt?

					SHOVELER
			   (shocked by this welcome)
		I'm okay--I'm all right.

					EDDIE JR.
		Lean on me, Dad.

					LENORE
		I'll hold your shovel, Dad.

They lead him back into the living room, and give him the prime spot on 
the couch.

					BUTCH
		You want a soda, Dad?

					SHOVELER
					(stunned)
		Okay.

He runs to get it as Eddie Jr. slides a footstool under his feet and 
Tracy puts a pillow behind his back.  Roland, the little one, cuddles 
up next to him, puts his arm around him.

					ROLAND
		Nice work. Dad.

					SHOVELER
		Thanks, Roland.

					ROLAND
		You really are a superhero, aren't you?

The Shoveler nods.  A few minutes later... The Shoveler sits on the 
couch, feet up, soda in hand. The television is off. His kids all 
huddled around him, hanging on his every word.

					SHOVELER
		And that's when the engine blew up.

					KIDS
		Whoa...

					BUTCH
		What did you do?

					SHOVELER
		Well...

ON LUCILLE as she comes in and sees... her husband surrounded by his 
kids, a happy man at last.

EXT.  LAKESIDE DINER - THE NEXT NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

INT. THE DINER - CONTINUOUS - ON THE SPLEEN

sitting between the Bowler and a bandaged Invisible Boy. The Bowler has 
her arm chummily around the Spleen's shoulder. The Spleen finally has 
real friends. Doc Heller discusses the art of fork throwing with the 
Raja as the Shoveler listens in. The Sphinx sits at the end of the 
table, silent.

					DOC HELLER
		So you're never actually conscious of range or 
		trajectory?

					RAJA
		Heck no.  I just chuck 'em.

Monica (in her waitress outfit) sits close to a bandaged Mister 
Furious.

ON THE TV -

Dawn Wong reports.

					DAWN
		It's been twenty-four hours since the deadly 
		psycho-sonic attack and bloody shoot-out that 
		left Casanova Frankenstein and dozen of the 
		city's top hoodlums dead... But tonight the 
		question remains... Who were these heroic 
		mystery men who saved our city?...

ON OUR HEROES -

					BOWLER
		Could have been anybody.

They laugh.

					RAJA
		Wait a minute... That's it.  That's our name.  
		We're... the Mystery Men.

They all like it, except for the Bowler.

					BOWLER
		Hey, do I look like a Man?

					SHOVELER
		Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.

					SPLEEN
			(singing, ala "Macho Man")
		Mystery, Mystery Man... I want to be a Mystery 
		Man...

		  		  SHOVELER & RAJA
		Shut up.

					BOWLER
		Eat your mustard.

					FURIOUS
		It doesn't matter what we call ourselves.  We 
		know who we are.

					RAJA
		Yes, Obie-wan.

					INVISIBLE BOY
		Hey... he's gone.

The others see... that the Sphinx's chair is empty.  Raja spots a 
crumpled napkin on the table, opens it up, and reads.

					RAJA
		"Until you need me again... Adios."

A silence... Reactions from our heroes as they realize that the Sphinx 
is gone...

					SHOVELER
		I miss him already.

Suddenly, somewhere in the night, a burst of gunfire and screams are 
heard.  THE FINAL MUSIC BEGINS...

					FURIOUS
		Amigos, duty calls.

The Mystery Men wolf their burgers, then stand and start for the 
street...

As Monica watches them leave, a PATRON asks her:

					PATRON
		Miss... who are those guys?

					MONICA
				(after a moment)
		I don't know.

JUST OUTSIDE THE DINER - A MOMENT LATER

HEROIC GROUP SHOT as the Mystery Men merch down the middle of street, 
toward the sound of the gunfire... and into the night.

          ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT FROM THE BACK.
          
          A PERVERT in a trench coat runs along the edge of the
          mall. A group of OLD WOMEN is coming toward the MAIN
          ENTRANCE. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          the old women. They SCREAM!
          
          The Pervert ducks behind the bushes and runs with the
          skill of a Navy SEAL. A FAMILY is walking down the
          sidewalk. The Pervert opens his trench coat and flashes
          them.
          
          The Pervert ducks behind a dumpster. He keeps running
          and sees a car driving by. The Pervert flashes the CAR.
          
          The Pervert takes a two-step run, sees ANOTHER LADY,
          flashes her. He dives behind a car. Then pops up and
          flashes ANOTHER GIRL.
          
          It's an all-out Pervert assault!
          
          The Pervert then runs across the parking lot, jumps a
          fence, and darts from the property -- vanishing as
          quickly as a Ninja who just perfectly executed an
          assassination.

          complain loudly.                                           
                                                                     
                                   MARK
                     Ladies, please, we're doing                     
                     everything we can to handle the
                     situation. Nothing is more                      
                     important to us than the safety of              
                     our shoppers. Now in the                        
                     meantime, feel free to check out
                     some of our wonderful back-to-
                     school sales. Excuse me for a                   
                     minute.
          
          Mark walks down the hallway that houses all of the         
          business affair offices. He stops at the RECEPTIONIST'S    
          desk.

          The Mall Manager quickly walks off.    On the way, he          
          passes a JANITOR.

                       No, senor.
                                                                         
          The Mall Manager keeps walking.
          
          
          INT. SECURITY OFFICE - DAY
          
          The Mall Manager comes into the surveillance room. It's
          a small office with monitors that show the different
          security cameras around the mall. DENNIS, a Mall
          Security guard with sunglasses who will not utter a word
          ever, turns around in the chair.
          
                                     MARK
                       Where is Ronnie?                                  
          
          Dennis shrugs.
          
                                                         CUT TO:
          
          
          INT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          Blackness. White shafts of light sporadically shoot
          through the dark and we see IMAGES. A GIANT FLASHLIGHT
          is inserted into a UTILITY BELT. MACE is inserted in the
          other side. A WALKIE-TALKIE is turned on. A TASER is
          sparked. MIRRORED SUNGLASSES are pushed over the nose.
          
          A garage door raises and bright light spills in...
          
          
          EXT. GARAGE - DAY
          
          A garage door opens slowly and reveals a souped-up ORANGE
          GOLF CART. There's a siren on top that spins around.
          The man driving is RONNIE BARNHARDT (28), a stocky mall
          security guard whose expression reads all business.
          Ronnie pulls out of the garage...
          
          SUPERIMPOSE:    OBSERVE AND REPORT
          
                                                               3.
          
          EXT. MALL - DAY
          
          HEAVY METAL MUSIC. A group of anarchist SKATERS rages
          through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they
          see. A couple of them smoke cigarettes. One skater
          grinds over a bench. One kid ollies onto the hood of a
          car. Another slams into an old man and knocks him over.
          
          Meanwhile, Ronnie sits in his golf cart -- waiting. He
          looks eerily like Mel Gibson at the beginning of Mad Max.
          
          The skaters ride past a set of construction cones. One
          skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking
          lot.
          
          The skaters soar past Ronnie, who flips on the silent
          orange siren and gives chase.
          
          As the skaters ride through the parking lot, Ronnie pulls
          up and drives alongside of them.
          
                                  RONNIE
                            (cop authority voice)
                    Pull over to the sidewalk, NOW!
          
          STEVIE, the leader of the skaters, yells back.
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Fuck off, Ronnie, it's just a                      
                    parking lot.                                       
          
                                  RONNIE
                    Sir, pull over to the sidewalk,
                    NOW!
          
          HECTOR, another skater, joins in.
          
                                  HECTOR
                    Leave us alone.                                    
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.
          
                                  RONNIE
                    Skateboarding is not allowed on
                    mall premises. Pull over now!
          
                                  STEVIE
                    We're not leaving.
          
                                  HECTOR
                    Yeah, fuck you!
          
          The skateboarders flip Ronnie off and push hard to get       
          away from him. Ronnie guns it and an all out chase
          ensues.
          
                                                      (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED:
          
          Ronnie pulls up alongside of a SLOW SKATER. Ronnie side-
          swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash
          can and fall.
          
          Ronnie catches up to ANOTHER SKATER. This time, Ronnie
          tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too
          fast. Ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges
          and ducks. Ronnie hits the brake. The skater thinks he
          has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his
          way. The skater nails the car and is thrown over the
          hood.
          
          Ronnie is back in the chase and only Hector and Stevie
          are left. Ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely
          behind the two kids.
          
          Ronnie rams Hector over and over from behind. Hector
          wobbles. Ronnie rams him again. Hector goes swerving
          off and falls down hard.
          
          Ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward Stevie.
          
          Stevie is good. He turns and rides through cars, ollies
          over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. Ronnie
          burns down the lane beside him.
          
          Stevie looks behind and Ronnie is nowhere in sight.    He's
          in the clear.
          
          Stevie turns back around and sees Ronnie, driving in
          reverse straight towards him. Ronnie rams into the
          skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.                     
          
                                     STEVIE

                       I was driving in reverse and

                       What?                                             
          
                                     RONNIE
                       That way I could handcuff you                     
                       smoothly and take you in. You                     
                       know, never mind, just get in the                 
                       goddamn golf cart.                                
          
          Stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the          
          golf cart.

          INT. MALL - SECURITY OFFICE - MORNING
          
          Ronnie is in the room with the monitors. The skaters sit
          across from him. There's a poster on the wall with the
          security guard motto: OBSERVE AND REPORT.
          
          Ronnie fiddles with his walkie-talkie.                      
          
                                  RONNIE
                    It seems like we go through this                  
                    every day. What's it going to                     
                    take for you all to realize that I                
                    won't tolerate this horseplay and                 
                    just do whatever you want to and                  
                    don't worry about the rules                       
                    attitude?                                         
          
                                  STEVIE
                    Ronnie, I hear what you're saying                 
                    and I just want you to know that                  
                    personally, it pains me to see you                
                    all worked up and I just want you                 
                    to know that I'm really sorry                     
                    because you can't do shit and you                 
                    can take your little rules and

          The Skaters all start cracking up.                          
          
                                  HECTOR

          The Skaters start laughing louder.                          
          
                                  RONNIE

                    and I phone it in. And that's                     
                    what I'm getting ready to do right

          Ronnie picks up the walkie-talkie and turns it on.   He     
          speaks into it.

                       Who gives a shit? Dennis, in                    
                       time, you'll come to accept                     
                       answering to me. Remember, there                
                       aren't any leaders in friendship.

          Dennis and Ronnie shake hands.    They walk out and lock     
          the doors behind them.

                       beer or something?
          
          Dennis doesn't say anything and just walks to his car.
          Ronnie follows.
          
                                     RONNIE
                       Yeah, you're right. You're
                       probably in no mood to party after
                       that news. Well, try not to take
                       it too hard. See you later,                     
                       buddy.
          
          Ronnie leaves Dennis and walks to his car.
          
          
          EXT. TRAILER - NIGHT
          
          Ronnie's home is a shitty double-wide at the very end of
          the shittiest trailer park in town.
          
                                                                 17.
          
          INT. RONNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
          
          Ronnie lives in a boy's room. There's all kind of
          posters up with instructions on how to execute choke
          holds, wrist locks, and other assorted death blows.
          However, the biggest decoration is a large diagram of the
          mall.
          
          Ronnie stands in the middle of his room with his MOM
          across from him. She's an old, thick boozer, with the
          strength of a father and the love of a mother. She downs
          a full beer and throws it against the wall.
          
                                  MOM
                    You think you're ready for a shot
                    at the title, motherfucker?!
          
                                  RONNIE
                    I'm ready, Mom.

                    Ding ding.
          
          Ronnie and his Mom take to fighting. Ronnie's Mom is
          surprisingly good and she lands the first blows to
          Ronnie's cranium.
          
                                  RONNIE

          Ronnie attacks his Mom. He manages to scoop her and body
          slam her to the ground. Ronnie's Mom flips out of it on
          the ground. However, Ronnie holds onto her wrist and          
          stands up, thus locking in the submission hold.
          
                                  MOM
                    Ah!

          Ronnie flips the wrist lock tighter!
          
                                  MOM

          Ronnie lets his Mom go.     She shakes off the pain.
          
                                     MOM

          Ronnie's Mom rubs her arm. Ronnie drops his guard and
          comes over to tend to his Mom's wounds. However, she's
          only playing possum. Ronnie's Mom sees an opening and
          attacks Ronnie at his legs. Ronnie goes down and the two         
          start wrestling again.

                       Yeah, man. I mean, I'm kind of on                   
                       extended vacation from college and

                       parents said I have to work if I                    
                       want to live at home, but I just                    
                       don't feel like doing anything.

                       find, I mean, what the hell could

          LOUD ROCK SCORE FADES TO LOUD ROCK SOURCE. A tricked-out
          Toyota pulls up to the parking lot. The car comes to a
          stop and out steps Brandi, the makeup counter girl.            
          
          Brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. As          
          she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door,
          the Pervert pops out. This time, he's upped his attack
          and beats off staring right at her.
          
          The horrendous sight stops Brandi dead in her tracks.          
          She SCREAMS bloody murder...

          It looks like a RAPE SCENE. Brandi cries in the makeup         
          chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall
          employees. Her makeup runs down her face as her
          effeminate coworker BRUCE consoles her. Mark is working        
          crowd control.

                       Okay, Brandi. Did you get a look                    
                       at the suspect?

                       Thank you. Brandi, can you                          
                       remember anything specifically?
                       What color was his hair? Was he
                       tall or short?

                       He was tall and skinny and he had
                       brown hair and it was real greasy.
          
          Detective Harrison begins writing in his note pad as
          Brandi speaks. Ronnie notices this and picks up some             
          paper and begins to write as well.

                       This is what I got so far.
          
          Ronnie holds up his paper. Ronnie has drawn a crude
          sketch of the Pervert that Brandi described, but it's           
          basically a long-haired stick figure with a penis.

          Ronnie puts his sketch away.

                       Okay, Brandi, I think that's good                  
                       for now. I think the best thing
                       at this point is to just follow up
                       with the other ladies who saw the
                       perpetrator yesterday and see if
                       they remember anything.

                       What if he comes back?

                       That's highly unlikely. These                      
                       incidents are usually random and                   
                       unpredictable. I'm sure you'll be                  
                       safe.

                       pretty clear that Brandi's been                     
                       targeted.

                       Well, how about the fact that she
                       was the first employee to get                       
                       assaulted? Not to mention the
                       fact that she is the prettiest
                       girl who works at this mall. To
                       me it seems obvious that this is
                       some sort of methodical villain
                       that plans on returning to finish
                       what he started by murdering
                       Brandi.

          The living room is dark. Ronnie and Nell are on the              
          couch making out. Ronnie is starting to get frisky. His          
          hands go to Nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt.

                       Someone must have broken in here                     
                       and turned them off.

                       My team just checked all the doors
                       and there are no signs of forced                     
                       entry. I've also checked out the                     
                       crime scene, but we didn't see any
                       fingerprints on the glass. The
                       suspect was probably wearing
                       gloves.

                       anything out of ordinary.
          
          A SEXY WORKER comes up to them holding a scandalous pair
          of undies.

          The Sexy Worker holds the undies up to her crotch.
          Ronnie looks and his tongue almost drops out of his

          Ronnie tacks up pictures of all of the      robbery "suspects"    
          on a bulletin board. It's pictures of       Saddamn and the       
          Devil Worshipper guy. Beside him is a       sketch of the         
          Pervert. The images are on the bottom       points of a           
          Pyramid.                                                          
          
          On top of the Pyramid is a combination drawing/picture of         
          Ronnie. The body is drawn with his arms folded across             
          his chest and a photo of his face is tacked on top. The           
          whole thing adds up to nonsense, with the only clear idea         
          is that he defeats them all. Ronnie sits back in his

                       Look, I got to talk to you about                   
                       something. I'm not really sure                     
                       how to put this. Let's see. If                     
                       you drove a Toyota.

                       I know, but let's just pretend you                 
                       drove a Toyota. Now, this Toyota                   
                       runs really good. It always                        
                       starts when you need it to and it                  
                       gets good gas mileage and you                      
                       don't have to do much to maintain                  
                       it. Then you get a really                          
                       important job like Astronaut, no                   
                       that won't work, you get a job as                  
                       the head of Wall Street. Well,                     
                       you may really like that Toyota,                   
                       but you're going to feel weird                     
                       about driving it to work every                     
                       day, right? Now let's say that                     
                       somebody offers you a chance to                    
                       get rid of that Toyota and instead                 
                       you get a Ferrari. It may be more                  
                       expensive and harder to drive, but                 
                       I mean, it just looks good as                      
                       hell. What would you do?

          Ronnie comes out of the closet and he's wearing a

          up, with a pair of black parachute pants. There's two
          belts for some DOUBLE BELT action. He's got no socks on
          and a pair of white shoes. He looks like a goddamn fool.

                       I'm serious, Dennis. A gentleman                  
                       never kisses and tells. So, just                  
                       stop with all the pressure because                
                       it's just not gonna happen.

                       details. I had sex with Brandi                    
                       last night.

                       much better. You know how many

          Nell, who looks like she's been crying nonstop, stuffs a       
          whole Cinnabon into her face. As it fills her cheeks,          
          she looks over to Ronnie's table and sees Ronnie making        
          thrusting motions at the table. Nell swallows, stuffs          
          another Cinnabon in, then storms out of the Food Court.

                       was steamy and sexy, but more than                
                       anything, I should tell you that                  
                       it's her soul that I fell for the                 
                       most. She got pretty tanked, but                  
                       I could just really tell that                     
                       she's a good person. The kind of                  
                       person that I could see myself

                       Okay, Mr. Barnhardt, there are
                       several steps you have to complete
                       in order to be eligible for the
                       police academy. Physical
                       evaluation, psychological test,
                       background check.

                       Now, I like to tell all new
                       recruits that they should complete
                       a ride along before making this
                       decision. It's where you actually
                       ride along with a real police
                       officer during a routine patrol.
                       It helps give you an idea of the
                       kind of situations you'll be
                       dealing with. Sound good?

                       Well, it's a low income area,
                       Ronnie. You're being kind of
                       prejudiced.

                       Oh, yeah, I can see that it's
                       basically a fine neighborhood.                       
          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON
                       That's right, but it hasn't been
                       easy. We still patrol this area
                       every night just to keep our
                       presence up.

                       patrols myself, but because I like
                       you, I'm going to let you do it
                       tonight.

                       about   department policy, so I'm
                       going   to need you to keep quiet

          Ronnie   opens the door and gets out of the car. As he
          exits,   a car drives by BLARING RAP MUSIC. The passenger
          throws   a beer bottle at Ronnie. He dodges it and the
          bottle   shatters on the ground.
          
          Ronnie is shaken, but he waves to Detective Harrison like
          he's okay. Detective Harrison waves back, then PEELS OUT
          OF THERE. Ronnie is confused.

          Ronnie looks petrified as he stands guard.       A BUM stands
          off to the side staring Ronnie down.
          
          Ronnie waves to the bum. The bum runs his finger under
          his throat. Ronnie tries to ignore him.
          
          A group of KIDS walk by Ronnie talking loudly.

          Ronnie grabs the little Kid by the shoulders to restrain
          him.

          Unbeknownst to Ronnie, Gang Members start walking up
          behind him. It's like that scene in Training Day where
          all the gangsters are hanging out right across the street

          Ronnie turns around to look for Harrison's return, but
          instead he sees that he is surrounded by a large group of
          pissed-off GANG MEMBERS.

          The Gang Members all pull out their guns and point them
          at Ronnie.

          Ronnie reaches into his boot and pulls out a small rod.
          He flips his wrist and it extends into a night stick.
          Ronnie's begging was a trap. Ronnie pops up and begins
          dropping all those motherfuckers with lightning-fast
          precision.
          
          Ronnie breaks arms and busts heads like a fucking ninja.
          Gang Member #1 comes in and hits Ronnie with a sucker
          punch, busting his nose wide open.
          
          Ronnie stands up and goes mano y mano in a fist fight
          with Gang Member #1. He starts kicking Ronnie's ass.
          Ronnie goes down again and Gang Member #1 starts stomping
          Ronnie.
          
          Ronnie grabs Gang Member #1's leg and twists it. He
          takes him down. Ronnie jumps on top of him and begins
          beating him senseless.
          
          SLOW MOTION: Ronnie stands up and looks around at the
          pool of beaten bodies. This is Ronnie at his most primal
          and also at his best.

                       You don't have to say anything.
                       Your actions speak for themselves.

          BAD-ASS PHYSICAL EXAM MONTAGE - INT. TRAINING FIELD -
          DAY
          
          SPRINT: The TESTING OFFICER blows a whistle and starts
          the 100 meter dash. Ronnie jumps off the starting line
          and hauls ass down the track. The other Trainees fall
          behind Ronnie as he smokes their asses.
          
          PULL-UPS: Ronnie jumps on the bar and begins to do pull-
          up after pull-up.
          
          SIDE SLIDE: The Testing Officer blows a whistle and
          Ronnie begins to shuffle side to side like an ice skater
          that never moves forward.
          
          SIT-UPS:     Ronnie goes hard on the sit-ups.
          
          OBSTACLE COURSE: Ronnie sprints up a wall and flips to
          the other side. He charges a body of water, then jumps
          onto the rope and swings safely to the other side.

          INT. MALL - NIGHT
          
          All the lights are off and we see the dark shadow creep
          through the darkness.
          
          The shadow breaks into the SHOE STORE and grabs as many           
          pairs of sneakers that it can carry. The shadow opens             
          the sliding cage and closes it from the other side. Then          
          bends down and locks it.

                    is getting butchered in the press.

                    the place off. The cops don't                      
                    have any leads. I'm getting shit

          Ronnie sits down on one of the benches in the mall.      He     
          watches a couple walk by, their little kid swinging             
          between their arms.

          ON THE TELEVISION: There's an update on the CAROLINA

          girls.
          
          As the TV blares the headline, Ronnie lays in his bed and    
          watches. The images shine COLOR on him, but Ronnie is in     
          his own world.

          Ronnie has the Special Elite Task Force assembled.

                    Hey, Ronnie, that's crazy talk.                    
                    Are you cool?

                    No, I'm not cool, Charles. In
                    fact, shit is seriously fucked up.
                    I've got to protect the whole mall
                    by myself. Now, I got you this
                    fucking job, when are you going to
                    stop being a little baby and do
                    something for a change.

                    college.' Grow a fucking pair,

                    I'm gonna go check the parking
                    lot.

                    You know, Dennis, for the longest
                    time I made this job my whole
                    life. I looked at this mall as a
                    kingdom and I looked at Mark as
                    the King. I thought of myself as
                    the first Knight and the
                    customers, well, they were the
                    peasants. I lived by an old code
                    where one was bound by duty and
                    honor. But now I don't know if I
                    believe in that code anymore.
                    I've lost my way. Now I just feel
                    like it's one big kingdom of shit.
                    Right now, I got half a mind just                  
                    to let this whole place burn.                      
                    Burn it to the fucking ground!

          Dennis stares down at the desk. Dennis takes off his hat
          and reveals that he has bleached white Eminem hair
          underneath. Next, he reaches under his collar and flips
          out a thin gold necklace. He kicks up his shoes and
          reveals the newest and freshest basketball kicks.

                       look at this mall as a Kingdom?!
                       Shit! I look at this place like a
                       motherfucking jail sentence. You
                       put on that uniform every morning,

                       a fucking outlaw and I'm going to
                       live that until the day I die. Now,
                       I can show you the way, but you've
                       got to be willing to accept it. So
                       I'm gonna ask you now, Ronnie. Are
                       you ready for a trip to the other side?

                       So, yeah, usually I take a joint
                       straight to the head before I
                       start work in this motherfucker,
                       but on really stressful days, I
                       like to get drunk too.
          
          Dennis pulls out a flask and gulps it down. Ronnie is
          still staring at the joint. Finally he takes a puff and
          begins violently coughing. He finally stops.

                       chick and the other was this mom.

                       Dressing rooms are a great place
                       to hide out, because nobody is
                       really going to think of looking
                       for me here. You can nap or just
                       kind of hang out and just really
                       have some personal time. Hey,
                       hand me that camera.
          
          Ronnie picks up a shitty camera and hands it to Dennis.

          Ronnie turns to walk, but Dennis grabs the hand of one of

          cracks Ronnie over the head with it. Ronnie goes down on
          his knees.

          Ronnie stops and begins to cry.     Then he runs out of the

          Ronnie lies in his bed and we...
          
          TIME LAPSE: The sun rises and sets three times through
          the window of his bedroom, signifying that three days
          have passed. The whole time, Ronnie doesn't move from
          his bed.
          
          Until...
          
          Ronnie gets on his "nice" clothes, but they're a far cry
          from his Security Guard uniform. Ronnie's Mom comes up
          to him.

                       Ronnie, you may not be smart or
                       handsome, but you've got dreams
                       inside of you and dreams make you
                       special. No matter what this
                       world tries to throw at you, they
                       can never take those dreams away.

                       know that mothers are supposed to

                       Alright, I'll tell you. Man, that                    
                       gig was one of the best jobs I                       
                       ever had. I got to wear a                            
                       uniform, I could smoke weed                          
                       whenever I wanted. For once in my                    
                       life, I felt like I was actually                     
                       somebody. I know most people                         
                       don't think it's shit, but I                         
                       really loved it. Then, all of a                      
                       sudden, I find out that your ass                     
                       got promoted over me.

          Ronnie realizes that this is his duty and his alone.
          Ronnie rises from the table slowly. He looks at Nell and
          nods acceptance. Then, Ronnie runs after the Pervert.
          
          
          INT. MALL - DAY
          
          The Pervert is in a full blown run through the mall. His
          trench coat is wide open and his wienie is flapping for
          the world to see. In a way, it's his greatest
          accomplishment. People scream! Mothers grab their
          daughters! No one is safe!

          Ronnie comes ripping out of the food court. He's got a
          fierce look of determination in his eyes. He runs hard
          to catch up with the Perv.

          There's a crowd surrounding the Cell Phone Kiosk. The
          Pervert bursts through the crowd and knocks people out of
          the way.

          The crowd totally clears a path for Ronnie, but Ronnie
          stops running and SUCKER PUNCHES SADDAMN. Saddamn goes            
          down hard and Ronnie rejoins the chase.

          Stevie slides his skateboard out for Ronnie to jump on.
          Ronnie jumps like he is going to land on the skateboard           
          and sail to the finish line. However, when Ronnie's feet          
          touch the board, it goes shooting out from under him.             
          Ronnie slams onto the ground. All of the skaters start            
          laughing.

          Ronnie picks himself up and starts to run again. He only
          makes it a little ways before he hits something slippery.         
          Ronnie falls onto the ground and cracks his head.

          getting closer.
          
          BOOM! Ronnie comes in from the side and nails the
          Pervert with the flashlight. Ronnie jumps on top of the
          Perv and beats the ever-living shit out of him. This is
          a vision of a man leaving all out on the field.
          
          Ronnie stops pounding and looks up. He sees Brandi              
          staring at him. Ronnie is overcome by anger and beats on
          the Pervert harder than ever before. Finally, Charles           
          comes in and pulls Ronnie off of him.
          
          A huge crowd has gathered around. Ronnie has blood all

          Detective Harrison is at the top of the stairs.      Ronnie
          walks right up to him.

                       I caught the Pervert.

                       I see that. Well, you better turn
                       him over to me and I'll take him
                       inside and book him.

                       Since you're a real Cop, right?                      
          
                                     DETECTIVE HARRISON
                       Hey, Ronnie, you may not be an                       
                       officer of the law, but you're the                   
                       law's right hand. Good job.                          
          
          Ronnie lets go of the Pervert. He nods to Harrison, then          
          turns his back and walks back down the steps. Ronnie
          gets into his golf cart and drives away.

          EXT. CAROLINA MALL - MORNING
          
          Ronnie stands in front of the Mall with Nell beside him.          
          Ronnie looks nervous, but Nell looks down at her yellow           
          ring with pride. She looks at Ronnie, sees a loose                
          eyelash and brushes it off of him.

          Ronnie takes a deep breath and walks over to where the

                       Good evening. We're here today                       
                       with Ronnie Barnhardt, head of                       
                       Mall Security here at Carolina                       
                       Mall. Last week, Ronnie was able                     
                       to catch The CAROLINA MALL FLASHER                   
                       single-handed and bring him to                       
                       justice. Ronnie, how did you                         
                       manage to find the identity of The                   
                       Pervert and take him down?
          
                                     RONNIE
                       Well, being a mall security guard
                       basically requires the same skill
                       set that someone in say the FBI
                       has. You have to use logic and
                       evidence and old-fashioned common
                       sense as well as the latest
                       technology to deduce the criminal
                       mind. It's what I do.
          
          All of a sudden, STEVIE AND THE SKATERS come up behind            
          Ronnie. They look into the camera lens and start                  
          smiling. Ronnie turns around and sees them, but tries to          
          focus on the reporter.

                                     RONNIE
                       Yeah, I'd just like to say that
                       Carolina Mall is back on track and
                       safer than ever...
          
          The Skaters start flipping off the camera.       Ronnie keeps     
          getting distracted.

                       In fact, there are some wonderful
                       sales taking place right now.                        
          
          Stevie walks up behind Ronnie and pretends to hump him.

          Ronnie turns around angrily.

          THE SKATERS jump on their skateboards and skate off.            
          Ronnie runs after them. He jumps into his GOLF CART and         
          gives chase.

                             VOICE (O.S.)
               Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose
               of this meeting is to determine
               whether, if released, you are
               likely to break the law again.
               While this was your first
               conviction, you have been
               implicated, though never charged,
               in over a dozen other confidence
               schemes and frauds. What can you
               tell us about this?

                             DANNY
               As you say, ma'am, I was never
               charged.


2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2

    Three PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a
    table.

                             BOARD MEMBER #2
               Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to
               find out is: was there a reason
               you chose to commit this crime, or
               was there a reason why you simply
               got caught this time?

                             DANNY
               My wife left me. I was upset.    I
               got into a self-destructive
               pattern.

                 If released, is it likely you
                 would fall back into a similar
                 pattern?

                               DANNY
                 She already left me once. I don't
                 think she'll do it again just for
                 kicks.

    Glances dart between the Board Members.

                               BOARD MEMBER #1
                 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you
                 would do if released?

    Danny considers.

    Danny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions
    and a form certifying their return to Danny.

    He opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers
    within, he smirks just a little.

                  I'm a free man.


4    INT. CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4

     Danny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare
     thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The
     old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver
     wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on?


5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5

     A sign reads: "NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY
     CORRECTIONAL FACILITY." Someone has graffitied below it:
     "If you were in prison, you'd be home now."

     The great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its
     frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you
     notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.)

     He hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of
     freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of
     the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New
     Jersey):    Life is hard out there.

     But Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step
     into free America...


A6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6

     Any empty wintery boardwalk.


6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6

     ... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red
     carpeting.

     As we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we
     hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of
     CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK
     from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS.

     And to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair
     and a snifter of brandy. He's home.


     ON DANNY'S WALLET

     As he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on
     green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of
     chips.

                                                             4.

7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7

    Danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for
    someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but
    without success. He turns his attention back to his
    cards, and the cards of the dealer.

    Nine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins.
    King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts.
    Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again.

    A second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes
    him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was
    scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar
    face is welcome.

                               DANNY
              Hello, Frank.

    The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and
    his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
    dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He
    quickly hides his astonishment.

                            FRANK
              I beg your pardon, sir. You must
              have me confused with someone
              else. My name is Ramon. See?

    He taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is
    the most African-looking Ramon you've ever seen. A pit
    boss circles close by and glares at them both.

                            DANNY
              My mistake...
                     (collecting his chips,
                      doubled)
              Table's cold anyway.

                            FRANK
              You might try the lounge at the
              Grand, sir. It gets busy around
              one.

                               DANNY
                        (as he goes)
              Thanks.


8   INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND                                          8

    Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around
    him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon,
    folds back the New York Times and scans.

    His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --
    "Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces
    Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...

    The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of
    the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely
    visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former
    owner, Reuben Tishkoff.

                               FRANK (O.S.)
                 Catching up on current events?

    Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him,
    changed out of his dealer's threads.

                               DANNY
                 Ramon?

                               DANNY
                 This afternoon.

                               FRANK
                        (re: Danny's drink
                         and whereabouts)
                 And already turning over a new
                 leaf.

    Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.

                               DANNY
                        (directly, this is
                         why he's here)
                 You seen him?

                               FRANK
                 Last I heard he was in L.A.
                 Teaching movie stars how to
                 play cards.
                        (beat)
                 Why? You don't have something
                 planned already?

                                DANNY
                 You kidding? I just became a
                 citizen again.

    Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye,
    and Danny can't help but grin: of course he has.

     MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.

                                FRANK
                  It's tough now, our line of work.
                  Everybody so serious. Too many
                  guns, too many computers. Whadda
                  you gonna do? Steal from ordinary
                  people?

                                DANNY
                  That would be criminal.

                                FRANK
                  So what's left? Banks? Hah.
                  Banks got no money. It's all
                  electronic. Only place that still

     Frank smiles.    Danny has his answer.

     phone again, and dials the card's number.

A11   EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT                A11

      PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP Rusty
      (tall, angular, ebony) leaning against his Ford Falcon.

                                  TOPHER (O.S.)
                   Hey!   Hey, Rusty!

                   Hey, I don't know if you're, uh,
                   you know, incorporated or anything,
                   like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know,
                   incorporated, but you should think
                   about it, really, 'cause I was
                   talking to my manager yesterday --

                   that Bernie, my business manager,
                   he's also Bernie, he was telling
                   me that since this, what we do,
                   could be considered research for,
                   you know, a future gig, that I
                   should be able to write it off as
                   a business expense. So he suggested
                   that it'd be better if I wrote you
                   a check, and thereby --

      Rusty looks at him:     are you stoned?

                   Josh is here. Seth is here.
                   David couldn't make it. He's got
                   two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania
                   because somebody just figured out
                   forty percent of the budget is
                   coming from Germany.

                                 RUSTY

                   Good evening, guys. Let's play

      A glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players
      are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry
      Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. (One
      star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also
      a known actress, to observe.)

      A glance back at Rusty reveals:     he's in for a long
      night.

                                 RUSTY
                   ... and let's play some cards.

                   You're showing. Yeah, I know she's
                   your girlfriend, Barry, but you
                   can't... Thank you.

                   Josh.   Deal to your left.


      SAME SCENE - LATER

      A WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with
      her. As she distributes a fresh round:

                                 WAITRESS
                   One McCallum neat. And four
                   bottled waters.

      Rusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a
      poker table.

                                 SETH
                          (triumphantly)
                   Two pair -- nines and twos.

      Rusty checks his hand:     a full-house full of face cards.

A14   INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT                              A14

      At the bar, Rusty orders a double.     He needs it.

                                 BARTENDER
                          (shouting over music)
                   How's the game going?!!

                                 RUSTY
                   It's been the longest hour of
                   my life.

                                 BARTENDER
                   What?!

                                 RUSTY
                          (at the same volume)
                   I'm running away with your wife.

      The Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes
      a thumbs-up before moving away.

                                 BARTENDER
                   Cool, man!

      Behind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light-
      district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued
      expression in their reflection. Then, out the corner
      of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through
      the pulsating crowd. Someone familiar to him. He
      follows.

                   Hey, Rusty, we got another player,
                   if that's alright.

      Topher indicates the new arrival: Danny.       Rusty looks
      as if there's a bad smell in the room.

                                  RUSTY
                   What's this?

                                  DANNY
                   The bouncer mentioned there was
                   a game in progress. I hope I'm
                   not intruding.

                                 TOPHER
                   No intrusion at all --

                                 RUSTY
                   What was his name, the bouncer's?

                                 DANNY
                   I don't remember.

                                  RUSTY
                   A card player with amnesia.    This
                   should be fun.


      AT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER

      Rusty deals the next hand.

                                 TOPHER
                   What do you do for a living,
                   Mr. Ocean? If you don't mind
                   my asking.

                                 DANNY
                   Why should I mind? Two cards,
                   please...
                          (long beat)
                   I just got out of prison.

                                  TOPHER
                   Really?

                   I stole things.

                   Incan matrimonial headmasks.

                   Don't let him fool you, Seth.
                   There's boatloads. If you can
                   move the things...
                          (finishing his deal)
                   One card to me.
                          (to Danny, pointedly)
                   ... but you can't.

                                 DANNY
                   My fence seemed confident enough.

                                 RUSTY
                   If you're dealing with cash, you
                   don't need a fence.

                                 DANNY
                   Some people just lack vision.

      Now the other players realize. These guys have a
      relationship. In fact, a criminal one. And, judging
      from their steely glares across the table, not a happy
      one.

                                 DANNY
                   Well, that's all behind us now.

                                 RUSTY
                   I should hope so.

      Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls
      out his wallet.

                                 DANNY
                   I raise you five hundred dollars.

      A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet.
      He and Rusty hold each other's stares.

                                  RUSTY
                   Guys: Day One: what's the first
                   rule of poker?

                BARRY                      TOPHER
        Um, never bet on, uh, on           'Leave emotion at the
        a --                               door.'

                   That's right. My friend here just
                   raised me out of pique.
                          (beat)
                   Today's lesson. How to draw out
                   a bluff. This early in the game,
                   that much money, I'm thinking he's
                   holding nothing better than a pair
                   of face cards.
                          (beat)
                   Seth, raise him.

                                SETH
                   Okay. Uh, your five hundred and...
                   another two?

      Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips.

                                  RUSTY
                   Tophe...

                   push him too high too fast. Want
                   to keep him on the leash. I call.

      It's Josh's turn.       He hesitates...

                                 JOSH
                   What's that to me? A thousand?

                   All you have to do is call.

                   What? Your girlfriend holding
                   your purse?

      That does it. Josh is in. The bet's to Danny. He
      checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.

                                 DANNY
                   Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say,
                   Seth, I always check my cards
                   before I make a bet. But be
                   cafeful. I could tell from your
                   face you're holding three of a
                   kind or better.
                          (digging his wallet
                           out)
                   Five hundred to call. And two
                   grand more.

      Danny stares Rusty down.      The others look a little pale.

                                 RUSTY
                   Guys, you're free to do what you
                   like. It's a lot of money. But
                   I'm staying in. He's trying to
                   buy his way out of his bluff.

      Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to
      leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth
      ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.

                                   RUSTY
                   We call.

      Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It's a winner.
      The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the
      first time tonight, Rusty blanches.

      As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys
      around him, Danny rakes in his pot.

                   Thanks for the game, fellas.

      A queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and
      company exit, and they begin signing autographs. Danny
      and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit
      about them.


16    INT. RUSTY'S FALCON - MOVING - NIGHT                             16

      Danny and Rusty ride silently, staring out opposite
      windows at Sunset Boulevard.

                                 RUSTY

                   Unprofessional.

      Rusty agrees.

                                 RUSTY
                   How was the clink? You get the

      Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off
      half, and hands it to Rusty.

                  You barge into my new workplace,
                  ruin my professional reputation,
                  least you could do is tell me
                  you've got something better for

17   INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT                                        17

     They're sitting in a booth over coffee.

                                    RUSTY
                  How's Tess?

     Danny stares at him:       next subject, please.

                                 RUSTY
                  Alright.   Tell me.

                               DANNY
                  It's tricky. No one's ever done
                  it before. Needs planning, a
                  large crew.

                                    RUSTY
                  Guns?

                                DANNY
                  Not loaded ones. It has to be
                  very precise. There's a lot of
                  security. But the take...

                                RUSTY
                  What's the target?

                                DANNY
                  Eight figures each.

                                    RUSTY
                  What's.    The.    Target.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                              13.

                                DANNY
                         (deep breath, then)
                  When's the last time you were in
                  Vegas?

                               RUSTY
                  What? You wanna knock over a
                  casino?

     Danny puts down his coffee. And shakes his head. And
     lifts three fingers: three casinos. Rusty must put down
     his coffee, too.


18   EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT                                     18

     It's after hours downtown.    Dark, empty, dead...


19   INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT               19

     Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces:     J.A.
     KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS.

     Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant
     offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance.
     As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty
     passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to
     its out box.

     At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and
     drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.

                                DANNY
                  The vault at the Bellagio.

     A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another
     underneath it.

                                RUSTY
                  If I'm reading these right -- and
                  I think that I am -- this is
                  probably the least accessible
                  vault ever designed.
                         (beat)
                  Oops. Actually, you know what,
                  I'm wrong. It's definitely the
                  least accessible vault ever
                  designed.

                                DANNY
                  Yep.

     Rusty's brow furrows just a little.

                                RUSTY
                  You said three casinos...

                  These feed into the cages at both
                  the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand.
                         (tapping vault)
                  But every dime ends up here.

                                RUSTY
                  The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These
                  are Terry Benedict's places.

                                   DANNY
                  Yes, they are.     Think he'll mind?

                                RUSTY
                  More than somewhat.


20   AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY                                        20

     No ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to
     reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a
     large fellow, he has to duck to exit.


21   BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY                                         21

     As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers
     the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him).

                                RUSTY
                  You'd need at least a dozen guys,
                  doing a combination of cons.

                                DANNY
                  Like what, you think?

                                RUSTY
                  Well, off the top of my head, I'd
                  say you're looking at a Boesky, a
                  Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two
                  Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh,
                  and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald
                  ever.
                         (beat)
                  Where do you think you're gonna get
                  the money to back this?

                                DANNY
                  As long as we're hitting these
                  three casinos, we'll get our
                  bankroll. Terry Benedict has a
                  list of enemies.

                                RUSTY
                  But does he have enemies with
                  loose cash and nothing to lose...
                         (smiles, realizing)
                  Aha.

                  Aha.

22   MOVING WITH SECURITY GUARD                                      22

     as he approaches Danny's and Rusty's voices...

23   BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY                                       23

                                   DANNY
                  So...

                                RUSTY
                  So, here's what I think: You
                  should take this plan, kick it
                  around for a week or two. Sleep
                  on it. Turn it over in your head.
                  Then: never bring it up to me
                  again.

                                  DANNY
                  Uh-huh.    So what are you saying?

                                RUSTY
                  I'm saying: this is like trying
                  to build a house of cards on the
                  deck of a speeding boat.

                                DANNY
                  Really? I thought it was much
                  harder than that --

     Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them
     square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up
     to block the light.

                                DANNY
                  Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little,

                  You two done up here?    Find what
                  you wanted?

                                DANNY
                  Yeah, thanks. You mind if we
                  borrow a couple drawings for the
                  night? Make some copies.

                                SECURITY GUARD
                  Whatever you need.

     Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple
     hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand.

                                   DANNY
                  'Preciate it.


24   AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY                                      24

     Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator. When its doors
     open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding.

                                RUSTY
                  I need a reason. And don't say
                  money.
                         (beat)
                  Why do this?

                                   DANNY
                  Why not do it?

     Rusty stares at him:    enough bullshitting around.

                                DANNY
                  Because yesterday I walked out of
                  the joint wearing my entire
                  wardrobe and you're colddecking
                  TeenBeat coverboys.
                         (beat)
                  Because the house always wins.
                  You play long enough, never
                  changing stakes, the house takes
                  you. Unless, when that special
                  hand comes around, you bet big.
                  And then you take the house.

     A beat.   Rusty smiles.

                                DANNY
                  A little. Did I rush it?   It felt

                                RUSTY
                  No, it was good.

     They step aboard the elevator.     As the door closes:

                  I wonder what Reuben will say?

25   EXT. TISHKOFF'S OPULENT BACK YARD (LAS VEGAS) - DAY             25

     REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement,
     forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch
     guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.

                                 TISHKOFF
                  Are you listening to me? You are,
                  both of you, nuts. I know more
                  about casino security than any man
                  alive. I invented it, and it
                  cannot be beaten. They got
                  cameras, they got watchers, they
                  got locks, they got timers, they
                  got vaults. They got enough armed
                  personnel to occupy Paris. Okay,
                  bad example...

                                DANNY
                  It's never been tried.

                                 TISHKOFF
                  Oh, it's been tried. A few guys
                  even came close. You know the
                  three most successful robberies in
                  Vegas history?


26   FLASHBACK - INT. SANDS CASINO FLOOR (1965)                      26

     An Adlai Stevenson-lookalike approaches a lockbox carrier
     from behind and snatches the box.

     He takes almost three steps before five security men leap
     at him and -- FREEZE FRAME on his wide-eyed expression of
     horror...

                                TISHKOFF (V.O.)
                  Number three. The bronze medal.
                  Pencilneck grabs a lockbox at the
                  Sands. He got two steps closer to
                  the door than any living soul
                  before him.

     RESUME ACTION: Adlai Stevenson gets a taste of what NFL
     quarterbacks experience every Sunday... five fold.


27   INT. FLAMINGO CASINO FLOOR (1971)                               27

     A hippie races toward the electronic sliding doors,
     clutching a tray full of chips, and as the doors begin to
     part for him -- FREEZE FRAME: A billy club appears out
     of nowhere...

                  Second most successful robbery.
                  The Flamingo '71. This guy
                  actually smelled fresh oxygen
                  before they got him.

     RESUME ACTION: The billy club comes down -- whap! --
     across the hippie's skull and it's Chicago '68 all over
     again.

                                TISHKOFF (V.O.)
                  Course, he was breathing out of a
                  hose the next three weeks, goddamn
                  hippie.

                  And the closest any man has gotten
                  to robbing a Las Vegas casino...


29   FLASHBACK - EXT. CAESAR'S PALACE ENTRANCE (1987)                29

     Tourists and valets scatter as a Euro-thief (pastel
     T-shirt beneath a white linen suit) bursts from the
     casino and takes five steps before -- FREEZE FRAME:
     GLASS EXPLODES from three different doors behind him and
     he arches his back in agony...

                                TISHKOFF
                  Outside of Caesar's in '87.   He
                  came, he grabbed, he got
                  conquered.

     RESUME ACTION: BULLETS rip the man to shreds and he
     collapses on Caesar's steps a bloody pulp.

                                TISHKOFF
                  But what am I saying? You guys
                  are pros, the best. I'm sure you
                  can make it out of the casino. Of
                  course, lest we forget, once
                  you're out the front door, you're
                  still in the middle of the fucking
                  desert!

     Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.

                                RUSTY
                  You're right.
                         (to Danny)
                  He's right.

                                DANNY
                  Reuben, you're right. Our eyes
                  are bigger than our stomachs.

                                RUSTY
                  That's exactly it. Pure ego.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Yeah yeah blah blah.

                                DANNY
                  Thank you so much for setting us
                  straight. Sorry we bothered you.

     They both rise to go.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Look, we all go way back. I owe
                  you from that thing with the guy
                  in the place, and I'll never
                  forget it.

                                DANNY
                  It was our pleasure.

                  I'd never been to Belize.

                  some remaindered furniture I wanna
                  send you.

     Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave.
     Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.

                                TISHKOFF
                  Just out of curiosity, which
                  casinos did you geniuses pick to
                  rob?

     Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this
     question, which of course he has.

                                DANNY
                  The Bellagio, Mirage, and the
                  M.G.M. Grand.

                  Those are Terry Benedict's

                                RUSTY
                  Say, you know, he's right.

     Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed
     cocktail.

                                TISHKOFF
                  You guys... Whadda you got against
                  Terry Benedict?

                                DANNY
                  What do you have against him?
                  That's the real question.

                                TISHKOFF
                  He torpedoed my casino, muscled me
                  out, now he's gonna blow it up
                  next month to make way for another
                  fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I
                  don't see what you're doin'.

                  Who do you have in mind?

     Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish.
     And so it begins...

                                 RUSTY (V.O.)
                  Alright.   Who's in?

                  Frank C. is in.


31   INT. CASINO OFFICE (ATLANTIC CITY)                             31

     Frank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief.   Across
     a desk, his boss fills out paperwork.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
                  Frank C. has developed a bad case
                  of bronchitis and is putting in
                  for a transfer to warmer climates.

     Frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay. He stops to
     light a cigarette, inhales with deep satisfaction before
     a banner: "WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS."

                  What about drivers?

33   EXT. VACANT, WEEDY DRAG RACETRACK - DAY                      33

     CLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its
     ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross
     it. Now take a step back...

     That souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off
     the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper.
     It's a remote-controlled toy.

     The ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an
     actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track
     at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race.

     The drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the
     wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote
     control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really.
     Peckerwoods, sure, but nice.

                             RUSTY (V.O.)
               I talked to the Malloys yesterday.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
               The Mormon twins?

                             RUSTY (V.O.)
               They're both in Salt Lake City,
               six months off the job. I got the
               sense they're having trouble
               filling the hours.

     Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK
     COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
     It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he
     jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his
     brother's vehicle.

     Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.

                                DANNY (V.O.)

     no one is watching them. Little do they know...

     ... LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a

     joystick in his left hand. He is flanked by FBI MEN.

     between the two. As he struggles to untangle himself from
     the leash...

     BANG! Wood shards and SPLINTERS of GLASS fly all around;
     Basher merely ducks his head and whistles. As the dust
     settles, three men move quickly past Basher and into
     (what the settling fog now reveals to be) a dynamited
     bank vault. ALARMS begin to sound: this is bad news.

     chock full of instructions.

                                COP
                  And that's all you used during the
                  event? Nothing else?

                                BASHER
                  Are you accusing me of booby-
                  trapping?

                                COP
                  Well, how 'bout it?

                                VOICE (O.S.)
                  Booby traps aren't Mr. Tarr's style.

     The Cop turns; standing behind him, stone-faced, is
     Rusty, in a dark suit and shades.

                                RUSTY
                  Isn't that right, Basher?

                                  BASHER
                  That's right.

                                RUSTY
                         (flashing badge,
                          briefly)
                  Peck, A.T.F. Let me venture a
                  guess. A simple G4 mainliner,
                  double-coil, backwound, quick
                  fuse with a drag under 20 feet.
                         (off Cop's reaction)
                  That's our man. Tell me something
                  else. Have you checked him for
                  booby traps on his person? I mean
                  really checked, not just for
                  weapons...

     The Cop looks bewildered. Rusty steps forward, yanks
     Basher onto his feet, spins him around. He moves his
     hands up and down Basher's legs, around his waist, under
     his arms.

                                RUSTY
                  Will you go find Griggs and tell
                  him I need to see him?

                                  COP
                  Who?

                  Just go find him, will you?
                         (as Cop stalks off;
                          under his breath)
                  How fast can you put something
                  together with what I passed you?

                                 BASHER
                  Done.   Thirty seconds all right?

                                 RUSTY
                  From when?

                                 BASHER

                           SNAP from behind his
                           back)
                  Now.


40   MOVING WITH RUSTY AND BASHER                                40

     They're hurrying; ahead of them is a wall of squad cars,
     a police cordon, and a crowd of onlookers.

                                 RUSTY
                  Ten seconds?

                                 BASHER
                  Not quite.   Is Danny here?

                                RUSTY
                  Around the corner.

                                BASHER
                  Be good working with professionals
                  again.
                         (beat)
                  Okay: go.

     And they both start running.

                                RUSTY
                  Everyone down! Get down!      There's
                  a bomb in the...

     And behind them the SQUAD CAR ERUPTS with a BANG! A
     collective SCREAM rises from the crowd, everyone ducks,
     cops hit the ground and cover their heads. Rusty and
     Basher move briskly past them, dodging their splayed legs
     like tires on an obstacle course. By the time the
     Explosives Cop thinks to look around for Basher, they've
     both disappeared.

42   INT. UNDER BIG TOP - DAY                                    42

     The Chinese National Circus, currently on tour in the
     Western United States. Trapeze artists, gymnastic teams,
     and trampoline daredevils fly, somersault, spin, and
     swing through the air.

     A full house applauds every feat. Danny and Rusty sit in
     the bleachers, surrounded by parents and kids munching on
     spindles of cotton candy. Tough guys in toyland.

                             ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                      (in Chinese, then
                       English)
               Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing
               Yen.

     A funambulist (YEN) begins his high-wire act...

                             DANNY
               So he can walk on a rope.

                             RUSTY
               More than that.

                             DANNY
               So he can juggle. We need a
               grease man, not an acrobat. Who
               else is on the list?

                             RUSTY
               He is the list.

                  Watch.

     Halfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very
     slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into
     a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is
     impressed.

                                RUSTY
                  There's your grease man.


43   EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PARKING LOT - DAY                     43

     Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car.

                                  DANNY
                  We need Saul.

                                RUSTY
                  He won't come. He swore off the
                  game a year ago.

                                DANNY

                  You can ask him.

     Rusty stops, stares at Danny, sighs.

44   EXT. DOG TRACK/BETTING WINDOW (MIAMI, FLA) - DAY                44

     SAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket
     patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out
     money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his
     tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves
     off...


45   THROUGH TRACK LOBBY                                             45

     Rusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as
     Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul
     disappears into the tunnel, he moves.


46   IN INFIELD                                                      46

     Saul sits on one of the long, general admission steps
     under the box seats. He produces an orange from his
     pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes
     appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but
     doesn't turn around.

                                SAUL
                  I saw you in the paddock before
                  the second race, outside the men's
                  room, when I placed my bet. I saw
                  you before you even got up this
                  morning.

                                RUSTY
                  How ya been, Saul?

                                  SAUL
                  Never better.

                                RUSTY
                  What's with the orange?

                                SAUL
                  My doctor says I need vitamins.

                                RUSTY
                  So why don't you take vitamins?

     For the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a
     look up at Rusty.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                  I got a box seat. Come on.


47   EXT. BOX SEATS - LATER                                         47

     A waiter serves coffee to Rusty and Saul.

                                RUSTY
                  I thought you drank bloody Mary's
                  at the track, Saul.

                                SAUL
                  A man shouldn't drink on the job.

                                 SAUL
                  Number four.

     There's the BELL; the electronic rabbit is released and
     the dogs break out of the gate. From this point on
     Saul's eyes never leave the race.

                                SAUL
                  You gonna ask me? Or should I
                  just say no and get it over with?

                                RUSTY
                  Saul, you're the best there is.
                  You're in Cooperstown. What do
                  you want?

                                SAUL
                  Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I
                  got wall-to-wall and a goldfish,
                  I'm seeing a nice lady, she works
                  the unmentionables counter at
                  Macy's. I've changed.

                                RUSTY
                  Guys like us don't change, Saul.
                  We stay sharp or we get sloppy,
                  but we don't change.

                                SAUL
                  Quit connin' me.

     They watch the race.

                                RUSTY
                  That your hound way in the back
                  there?

                                SAUL
                  He breaks late. Everyone knows
                  this.

     On the track: The dogs are now coming around the back
     stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering.

                                SAUL
                  You gonna treat me like a grownup
                  at least? Tell me what the scam
                  is?

     Under the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's
     ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around
     him people are standing and shouting.

     Rusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and
     walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish
     line... last by several lengths.

     Saul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of
     losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a
     ticket to Las Vegas.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
                  And Saul makes ten.


48   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                              48

     Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment.   A
     nearby TV with the sound off plays a promo for an
     upcoming Tyson fight.

                                DANNY
                  Ten should do it, don't you think?
                         (as Rusty shrugs)
                  You think we need one more?
                         (as Rusty shrugs)
                  You think we need one more.
                         (as Rusty shrugs)
                  Okay. We'll get one more.


49   INT. CROWDED SUBWAY CAR (CHICAGO)                             49

     Native Chicagoans demonstrate their indigenous sixth
     sense -- L-car balance -- as the TRAIN bends and SHAKES
     at a corner.

     One passenger in particular keeps his footing, a young
     man in a frayed jacket: LINUS.

     Two overgroomed STOCKBROKERS stand with their backs to
     the young man, yammering about high interest yields, and
     consequently they don't notice (and neither do we, not at
     first) that Linus is slowly picking one of their pockets.

     The thievery is glacier-paced: Linus, his face always
     forward and inscrutable, gingerly raises one tail of his
     target's Brooks Brothers jacket and then, with
     incomparable dexterity, unbuttons his wallet pocket with
     a flick of his thumb and forefinger.

     From halfway down the train car, nothing appears amiss,
     and no passenger looks the wiser. Or so it seems...

     A copy of the Chicago Sun-Times, opened and upheld,
     lowers just enough to allow its reader a peek at Linus.
     It is Danny, smirk on his lips: He (and he alone) is
     aware of the ongoing heist.

     Back to Linus, his spoils (a Gucci wallet) now in sight,
     but he waits for just the right moment, and then, when
     the train hits another curve...

     ... he stumbles forward, his left hand finding support on
     the Stockbroker's shoulder as his right relieves the man
     of his wallet.

                                LINUS
                  Sorry 'bout that.

                                STOCKBROKER
                  No problem, guy.

     The Stockbroker resumes his yacketing, oblivious, as
     Linus tucks his prize into his own jacket pocket, face
     betraying nothing. Only Danny appreciates the artistry
     performed here today. He folds the Sun-Times under his
     arm as...


50   INT. UNION STATION - SUBWAY STATION                            50

     ... The SUBWAY SQUEALS to a stop. Linus jumps out,
     leaving his prey aboard, and a few moments later, Danny
     steps off, too.


51   INT. UNION STATION - EVENING                                   51

     The hurly-burly of rush hour in Union Station.

     Commuters zig and zag, this way and that, all on furious
     schedules, and Linus slips blithely through them, in no
     hurry, a man who's pulled this job a thousand times
     before.

     He dodges and sidesteps crazed commuters, and except for
     a brief brush with one well-dressed man (the Sun-Times
     tucked under his arm), he escapes the station without
     incident.


52   EXT. UNION STATION - EVENING                                     52

     Linus exits, casually reaching into his jacket to count
     his winnings. And his face falls.

     All he finds where the stolen wallet once resided is a
     calling card. On one side, in engraved printing:
     "DANIEL OCEAN." On the flip side, in handwriting: "Nice
     pull. Murphy's Bar, Rush & Division."


53   INT. MURPHY'S BAR - FIVE MINUTES LATER                           53

     On a tabletop: the Gucci wallet beside a half-drunk
     Guinness. Linus enters the front door, cases the joint,
     spots the wallet on the table, and Danny behind it.

                                 DANNY
                  Hi, Linus.   Sit down.

                                 LINUS
                  Who are you?

                                DANNY
                  A friend of Bobby Caldwell's.   Sit
                  down.

     Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he
     sits.

                                DANNY
                  Bobby told me about you. Said you
                  were the best set of hands he ever
                  saw. Didn't expect to find you
                  working wallets on the subway.

                                LINUS
                  That wasn't work, that was
                  practice.

     Danny reaches into his jacket and sets a plane ticket on
     the table. He keeps his hand over it.

                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               34.

53   CONTINUED:                                                      53

                                DANNY
                  You're either in or out, right
                  now.

                                LINUS
                  What is it?

                                DANNY
                  A plane ticket. A job offer.

                                LINUS
                  You're pretty trusting pretty
                  fast.

                                DANNY
                  Bobby has every faith in you.

                                LINUS
                  Fathers are like that.
                         (off Danny's reaction)
                  He didn't tell you?
                         (as Danny shakes
                          his head)
                  He doesn't like me trading on his
                  name.

                                DANNY
                  You do this job, he'll be trading
                  on yours.

                                LINUS
                  What if I say no?

                                DANNY
                  We'll get someone else who won't
                  be quite as good. You can go back
                  to feeling up stockbrokers.

     Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at
     the wallet. It's one or the other.

     A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill.
     When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet
     remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone.
     Linus is reading it.

                                DANNY
                  That's the best lift I've seen you
                  make yet.

                                LINUS
                  Las Vegas, huh?

54   LAS VEGAS - AERIAL VIEW - ESTABLISHING - DUSK                     54

     The city looms out of the desert like an infernal
     machine, lights flashing, skyline pulsing, a neon
     fortress.

     One thing in particular catches our eye: an enormous
     billboard with an ad for the upcoming boxing match
     between Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis. Below it, a
     promoter hands out fliers for strip joints and call
     girls.

56   INT. REUBEN TISHKOFF'S MANSION (LAS VEGAS) - NIGHT                56

     Frank Catton is already here, mixing a drink, when --
     DING DONG -- the DOORBELL CHIMES. Tishkoff shuffles
     toward the front (he's given the help the night off) and
     opens his door to find...

                                LIVINGSTON
                  Trick or treat.

     ... Livingston, Basher, Yen, the Malloys, Saul and Linus
     crowding his doormat. A taxi-van pulls away behind them.

                                TISHKOFF
                  What, you guys get a group rate or
                  something?


57   INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - LATER                               57

     Along one wall, a buffet table has been set up, and while
     Virgil and Turk pile shrimp onto plates, Saul pockets an
     orange for later.

                                TURK
                  You make it out to Utah much,
                  Saul?

                          in the Tabernacle)
                  Not as much as I'd like.

                                 TURK
                  You should.   You'd like it.   You'd
                  like Provo.

                  Anybody see the salsa goes with
                  this?

     At the wet bar, Basher mixes a drink for Livingston; on a
     couch, Yen balances coffee-table ornaments into a
     skyscraper, to Frank's astonishment. In a corner, off on
     his own, Linus watches the company, his eyes narrowing,
     wary. Until...

                                  DANNY (O.S.)
                  Gentlemen:    welcome to Las Vegas.

     Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the
     room, flanked by Rusty and Tishkoff. He starts down...

                                 DANNY
                  Everybody eaten? Good. Everybody
                  sober? Close enough. Most of you
                  know each other already. You
                  probably haven't met Linus
                  Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid
                  outta Chicago.

     Linus trades nods around the room.

                                DANNY
                  Okay. Before we start, nobody's
                  on the line here yet. What I'm
                  about to propose to you happens to
                  be both highly lucrative and
                  highly dangerous. If that doesn't
                  sound like your particular brand
                  of vodka, help yourself to as
                  much food as you like and safe
                  journey. No hard feelings.
                         (pauses, soberly)
                  Otherwise, come with me.

     He turns and walks out of the living room, into another.
     Rusty is close behind; he turns briefly, casts an eye
     over the assembled and keeps going. The guys look each
     other over, sizing things up.

                  What the hell.

     And he follows, along with Frank and Livingston. Then
     Virgil, Turk and Yen. Then Saul. That leaves Linus,
     watching the line of men disappear. He turns to find
     Tishkoff by his side, staring at him.

                                   LINUS
                  Hi.

58   INT. GAME ROOM                                                 58

     A tournament-level pool table holds center stage here.
     Atop its green felt sits a raised, elaborate miniature of
     Terry Benedict's Las Vegas: three casinos and hotels
     with the Strip running between them.

     As the eleven surround the table and the model...

                  the M.G.M. Grand. Together,
                  they're the three most profitable
                  casinos in Las Vegas...

     Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath
     is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each
     leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator
     shaft which descends into an enormous vault.

                                DANNY
                  Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault.
                  Located below the Strip, beneath
                  two hundred feet of solid earth.
                  It safeguards every dime that
                  comes through each of the three
                  casinos above it.
                         (beat)
                  And we're going to rob it.

     Everyone takes a breath, awed.

                                LINUS
                  Smash-and-grab job, huh?

                                RUSTY
                  It's a little more complicated
                  than that.

     Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of
     Tvs.

                  security tapes from the three
                  casinos.

     On the monitors: three montages of black-and-white
     security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages,
     moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their
     images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the
     vault.

     As the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV
     to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a
     POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself...

                  Okay.    Bad news first. This place
                  houses   a security system which
                  rivals   most nuclear missile silos.
                  First:    we have to get within the
                  casino   cages --

                                RUSTY

                  -- which anyone knows takes more
                  than a smile. Next: through
                  these doors, each of which
                  requires a different six-digit
                  code changed every twelve hours.
                  Past those lies the elevator, and
                  this is where it gets tricky: the
                  elevator won't move without
                  authorized fingerprint
                  identifications --

                  the Bellagio and the vault below - -

                  Furthermore, the elevator shaft is
                  rigged with motion detectors --

                                RUSTY
                  -- meaning if we manually override
                  the lift, the shaft's exit will
                  lock down automatically and we'll
                  be trapped.

                                DANNY
                  Once we've gotten down the shaft,
                  though, then it's a walk in the
                  park: just three more guards with
                  Uzis and predilections toward not
                  being robbed, and the most
                  elaborate vault door conceived by
                  man. Any questions?

     Silence. For a moment, each man keeps his two dozen
     questions or more to himself. At last, one speaks up...

     The Amazing Yen.    In Cantonese.   Of course, no one
     understands him.    Except Rusty.

                                RUSTY
                         (in response)
                  No. Tunneling is out. There are
                  Richter scales monitoring the
                  ground for one hundred yards in
                  every direction. If a groundhog
                  tried to nest there, they'd know
                  about it. Anyone else?

     Another silence. Either the guys are too dumbfounded by
     that bilingual exchange or too numbed by the task ahead
     of them to speak.

                                TURK
                  You said something about good
                  news...

                                DANNY
                         (smiles, happy
                          someone asked)
                  The Nevada Gaming Commission
                  stipulates: a casino must hold in
                  reserve enough cash to cover every
                  chip at play on its floor. As I
                  mentioned, this vault services
                  each of the three casinos above
                  it. That means: during the week,
                  by law, it must hold anywhere from
                  sixty to seventy million dollars
                  in cash and coin. On a weekend,
                  between eighty and ninety million.
                  On a fight night, like the one two
                  weeks from tonight, the night
                  we're going to rob it, at least a
                  hundred and fifty million. Without
                  breaking a sweat.
                         (gazing about room)
                  Now there are eleven of us. Each
                  with an equal share. You do the
                  math.

     MOVING AROUND the table ON ten faces, as everyone does
     precisely that, in their heads, except for Virgil who
     does it on his fingers. He whistles.

                                RUSTY
                  That's what I said.

                                 SAUL
                  I have a question.
                          (as Danny turns
                           to him)
                  Say we do get into the cage, and
                  through the security doors there,
                  and down the elevator we can't
                  move, and past the guards with
                  guns, and into the vault we can't
                  open...

                                RUSTY
                  Without being seen by the cameras.

                                DANNY
                         (off everyone's
                          astonishment)
                  Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to
                  mention that.

                                SAUL
                  Say we do all that. We're just
                  supposed to walk outta there with
                  a hundred million dollars in cash
                  on us without getting stopped?

     Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one
     Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny
     now.

                                 DANNY
                  Yeah.

     Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has
     flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.

                                 DANNY
                  Alright.   Here's how we'll begin.

     MOVING WITH a cash cart as security guards push it past
     tourists, past cocktail waitresses, past Linus sitting at
     a blackjack table.

                  First task: reconnaissance. I
                  want to know everything that's
                  going on in all three casinos.
                  From the rotation of the dealers
                  to the path of every cash cart...


61   INT. BELLAGIO - BREAK ROOM - DAY                              61

     Two security TECHNICIANS on a smoke break grumble about
     their sex lives. Across the room, Frank sits innocently
     doing a crossword.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
                  I wanna know everything about
                  every guard, every watcher, anyone
                  with a security pass. I wanna
                  know where they're from, what
                  their nicknames are, how they take
                  their coffee...


     BETTER VIEW

     REVEALS: On his crossword, Frank has scribbled a
     transcript of the Technicians' conversation. As he
     glances up at an electronic keycard clipped to one
     Technician's belt...


62   INT. MIRAGE CASINO - DAY                                      62

     ... an identical keycard is swiped through a keypad, its
     light flashing red to green, admitting a guard into an
     "Employees Only" doorway.

     The Malloys, who've shadowed the guard here, note a
     sentry standing watch by the door as well as a security
     camera embedded in the ceiling above: No one walks
     through that portal unchecked.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
                  Most of all, I want you guys to
                  know these casinos. They were
                  built as labyrinths, to keep
                  people in. I want you guys to
                  know the quick routes out.

     Their job done, the Malloys start toward the casino's
     exit... in different directions. They begin to argue:
     The exit's that way -- no, it's that way.

                                                              45.

63   EXT. LAS VEGAS BOULEVARD - OUTSIDE THREE CASINOS - DAY          63

     With two dozen other tourists, Basher crosses the street
     and when he meets a manhole cover he stops and,
     extracting a small metal hook from his jacket, removes it
     from its perch, so casual about the action that no
     passerby looks twice at him.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
               Second task: power. On the night
               of the fight, we're gonna throw
               the switch on sin city. Basher,
               it's your show.

     Basher drops into the hole, pulling the cover over him,
     as we PULL UP OVER the Bellagio and...

     Dozens of monitors manned by dozens of watchers canvas
     dozens of casino tables; only NASA's control rooms house
     more technology.

     Apart from the fray, another bank of monitors manned by
     two watchers (let's call them, for no particular reason,
     FAT and SLIM) oversee a different section of the casino:
     the cage, its tunnels, the elevator, and the vault it
     leads to; everything, in fact, which our team saw in the
     game room.

                             DANNY (V.O.)
               Third task: surveillance. Casino
               security has an eye and ear on
               everything, so we'll want an eye
               and ear on them. Livingston...

               Well, it's not the least
               accessible system I've seen, but
               it's close. I don't suppose they
               have a closed-circuit feed I could

     Danny shakes his head:     no such luck.

                                LIVINGSTON
                  Then this is definitely a black
                  bag job. Do they employ an in-
                  house technician?

     Danny looks to Rusty who, behind them, tampers with
     Livingston's audio-video setup: several portable
     monitors, a laptop and modem, telephone headset, etc.

     DANCE MUSIC overwhelms the SOUNDTRACK...


66   INT. OLYMPIC GARDENS STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                        66

     ... as we join a lap dance already in progress. A
     security Technician (one of the two Frank eavesdropped on
     in the break room) shells out twenty bucks every three
     minutes for a DANCER to grind her pelvis against his
     chest...

     ... and while the Technician grins not-very-soberly and
     ogles her perfect breasts and paws at her midriff, the
     Dancer secretly removes the keycard from his belt.

                                 DANCER
                  I'll be right back, honey.    Don't

     She pouts, flirtingly, as she does for every idiot who
     drops a line like that, then makes her way to...


67   EXT. OLYMPIC GARDENS STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                        67

     ... where Rusty waits for her, and when she slips him the
     keycard, he slips her a c-note.

                                RUSTY
                  Thanks, Charmaine. I'll have it

     "Happy Anniversary!" -- as a delivery boy carries them
     through the casino, and just as he's passing an
     "Employees Only" door (complete with sentry and embedded
     ceiling camera)...

     ... he bumps into a TOURIST, and the balloons drift out
     of his hand and into the camera...

70   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - NIGHT                  70

     The SENTRY (#433) hears this and spots the balloons
     covering the embedded camera and approaches the delivery
     boy (who by freak accident happens to be Virgil
     Malloy)...

                             SENTRY
               Excuse me, sir: You're going to
               have to move your balloons.

     ... but Virgil's too busy picking a fight with the
     Tourist (surprise, surprise: Turk Malloy) to listen.

     And with the Sentry out of position...

     ... Livingston (dressed now in a technician's uniform,
     don't worry about how he got it) goes quickly to the door
     and swipes the newly-acquired keycard and when it flashes
     red-to-green, he enters...

     (he's in the lions' den now), then checks his palm:
     drawn there in ballpoint is a diagram of the cage
     corridors.

     Livingston's work here is almost done: he clips a small
     mechanism (known in his industry as a "spider" -- it's
     small, black, antenna-less and hides in dark places) to a
     main conduit, then verifies a tiny receiver he holds is
     picking up the spider's feed.

     One last click into place...

     appearance.

               Why do they paint hallways that
               color?

     Livingston steps outside. His job done, he exhales and
     wipes the sweat from his brow and checks his palm for
     directions and...

     Whoops. His sweat just smeared the ballpoint. He's
     flying blind. He looks left down a corridor, then right,
     trying to remember which way he came from. No idea.

     MOVING WITH Livingston as he tries to find his way out.
     He takes a left...

     Whoops again: here comes Fat, dead ahead.    Livingston
     has no recourse but to march right by him.

                  Fine, thanks.

     Livingston continues on, and maybe for a second he thinks
     he's in the clear, especially when he sees the exit
     looming ahead, but then Fat turns behind him and hails
     him back...

                                  FAT
                  Hey...

     At last, the Sentry outmaneuvers Virgil and Turk and
     grabs the balloons himself. Virgil quickly snatches them
     back...

                                VIRGIL
                  Hey... get your own balloons.

     Livingston approaches the exit's keypad and swipes his
     keycard: the light does not flash red-to-green.

                                  FAT
                           (on his tail)
                  Hey...

     Livingston looks: he swiped the wrong side of his
     keycard. He tries again. Red flashes to green. He
     pulls the door...

     ... but Fat blocks it.       Livingston peers up, certain he's
     had it.

                  You dropped this.

     Fat holds out Livingston's receiver and drops it in his
     hand.

     The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools,
     paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share,
     carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus
     act in a hardware store.

                                DANNY (V.O.)
                  We need to build an exact, working

88   EXT. BILLY TIM'S VAN AND TRUCK DEALERSHIP - OFFICE - DAY         88

     Outside a window: Turk and Virgil jump up and down on
     opposite bumpers of a van, testing its durability.

     Inside, Frank negotiates with BILLY TIM, a Cal-
     Worthingtonesque redneck car dealer, who half-pays
     attention to him, half-frets over the Malloys outside.

                                BILLY TIM
                  I'm sorry: eighteen-five each is
                  the best offer I can make you.

                                FRANK
                         (playing a bit of
                          a dandy)
                  Oh, I understand perfectly. They
                  are beautiful vans. Well, I thank
                  you for your time, Mister...?

                                 BILLY TIM
                  Denham.   Billy Tim Denham.

                                FRANK
                  Yes, Denham, like a jean.
                         (they shake)
                  You know: you have lovely hands
                  -- do you moisturize?

     Frank's not letting go of the man's hand, the object now
     is to force Billy Tim into lowering his price just to get
     Frank out of his office.

                                FRANK
                  I swear by it. I try all sorts of
                  lotions. I went through a
                  fragrance-free period last year,
                  but now I'm liking this new brand
                  fortified with rose hip. My
                  sister, you know, she uses the
                  aloe vera with the sun screen
                  built in...

                                BILLY TIM
                         (just can't get
                          his hand back)
                  Uh-huh. You said you'd be willing
                  to pay in cash?

                                FRANK
                  I did. You know: they say
                  cinnamon is wonderful for your
                  pores. Read that on the internet.
                  And that ideally you should be
                  wearing gloves to bed, but I find
                  that would interfere with my
                  social agenda. Problem is: I get
                  a reaction to camphor so I can't
                  use traditional remedies...

                                BILLY TIM
                  If you could pay cash, I could
                  probably drop the price a little.
                  To, say, seventeen...
                         (as Frank squeezes
                          a little)
                  ... sixteen each.

                                FRANK
                         (big smile)
                  That would be lovely.

     dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he
     missed.

                                DANNY

90   INT. HABERDASHERY                                              90

     A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money
     can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...

                                SAUL
                  This is nice material.

                                DANNY
                  It's Armani, Saul.

                                SAUL
                  It's very nice.

     Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to
     his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a
     moment."

                                DANNY
                  Saul, you sure you're ready to do
                  this?

     Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his
     entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes
     icicles.

                                SAUL
                  If you ever question me again,
                  Daniel, you won't wake up the
                  following morning.

     They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never
     waver.

                                  DANNY
                  You're ready.

     Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately
     slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...

                                SAUL
                  Hello.  My name is Lyman Zerga...

91   INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY                                         91

     Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in
     Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on
     his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge
     of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even
     deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could
     be Scottish, could be Israeli...

                             SAUL
               My name is Lyman Zerga... My name
               is Lyman Zerga...

     Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.

                             DANNY
               There's a little over twenty grand
               there, Saul. Try to make it last.

     Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...

                                SAUL
               You seen my...

                             DANNY
                      (handing him Rolaids)
               Bought you a fresh roll.

     The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry
     of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and
     Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for
     him.

                             VIRGIL
               Mr. Zerga, we're here.

                             DANNY
               Good luck, Lyman.

                             SAUL

     Saul, as Lyman Zerga, makes as low-profile an entrance
     into the Bellagio as he can with bodyguards preceding and
     trailing him. He approaches a V.I.P CONCIERGE...

                   My name is Lyman Zerga.   I'd like

                   I don't make reservations.

      A longer glance at Lyman's bodyguards tells the Concierge
      this is not a man to be denied. As he jumps to it...


A93   INT. OUTSIDE RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE - DAY                        A93

      Outside a restaurant's entrance, Rusty and Linus sit
      before two slot machines, idly dropping in quarters as
      they watch Saul receive the royal treatment.

                                  RUSTY
                   Okay.   Tell me about Benedict.

                                 LINUS
                   The guy is a machine.


93    EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - DAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                  93

      TERRY BENEDICT emerges from a Town Car and, from his
      haircut to his smile to his pant-cuffs, he is effortless
      perfection. He is Vegas royalty, yet he denies eye
      contact to no man. He strides into his casino and,
      appearing behind a pillar, Linus follows him in.

                                 LINUS (V.O.)
                   He arrives at the Bellagio every
                   day at two p.m. Same Town Car,
                   same driver. Remembers every
                   valet's name on the way in. Not
                   bad for a guy worth three-quarters
                   of a billion.


94    INT. BELLAGIO - ELEVATOR BAY (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                94

      The doors open, and Terry Benedict steps out.     Linus
      watches from a craps table.

                                 LINUS (V.O.)
                   Offices are upstairs. He works
                   hard, hits the lobby floor at
                   seven on the nose.

95   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (SUPER SLOW MOTION)               95

     From a balcony, Benedict stands overlooking the casino
     floor. His CASINO MANAGER approaches and they confer.

                             LINUS (V.O.)
               Spends three minutes on the floor
               with his casino manager.

                             RUSTY (V.O.)
               What do they talk about?

                             LINUS (V.O.)
               All business. Benedict likes to
               know what's going on in his
               casinos. There's rarely an
               incident he doesn't know about
               or handle personally.


96   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM (SUPER SLOW MOTION)                    96

     Benedict works the room. He speaks to a Japanese High
     Roller in Japanese, to a Swiss in German, etc.

                             LINUS (V.O.)
               He spends a few minutes
               gladhanding the high rollers.
               He's fluent in Spanish, German and
               Italian, and he's taking Japanese
               lessons, getting pretty good at
               it. He's out by seven-thirty,
               when an assistant hands him a
               black portfolio. Contents: the
               day's take and new security codes.
               Then he heads to the restaurant.

     Indeed, as Benedict makes his exit, an assistant hands
     him a black portfolio.

97   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - OUTSIDE RESTAURANT                      97

     Rusty and Linus watch the entrance:    No one enters.

                             LINUS
               Give him another ten seconds.

     Around the corner comes Benedict, carrying his black
     portfolio.

                              LINUS
               As I said:   a machine.

                             RUSTY
               And that portfolio contains the
               codes to all the cage doors?

                  last guy caught cheating here,
                  Benedict not only sent him up for
                  ten years, he got the bank to
                  seize the guy's home and
                  bankrupted --

                  He doesn't just go after your
                  knees, he goes after your
                  livelihood. And everyone-you-
                  ever-met's livelihood.

                  Now what?

                  Now comes the girl... if she comes
                  in after he does, that means
                  they're in a snit.

                                RUSTY
                  Where's she come from?

                                LINUS
                  The museum downstairs. She's the
                  curator there. Wait... here she
                  is. You'll like this.

     Rusty looks up as...

     ... a beautiful woman (the one Danny saw on Benedict's
     arm in the New York Times photo) appears. Elegantly
     dressed, a knockout, she moves very much in her own
     private space. And Rusty's face just about drops at the
     sight of her.

98    EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         98

      Construction continues into the wee hours.


99    INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         99

      A facsimile of the Bellagio vault sprouts into shape.
      Livingston fixes a security camera in a corner, then
      matches its image (of Frank staple-gunning floorboard
      into place) to a security tape of the real McCoy.

      On the other side of the garage, Turk and Virgil go to
      work on their newly-purchased vans, with wrenches and
      blow torches. Tishkoff recognizes a gasket Virgil
      handles.

                              TISHKOFF
                This looks familiar. Where'd you
                get this?

                              VIRGIL
                Off your Rolls.

                               TISHKOFF
                Danny!   Tell 'em not to touch the
                Rolls!

      Overlooking the whole enterprise is Danny, grinning from
      ear to ear, happy in his work. He checks a stopwatch in
      his hand as...

      ... the false top to the cash cart before him flies open,
      revealing Yen within, his arms, legs and torso folded
      into a three-by-four foot space. He whips an air hose
      from his mouth and inhales deeply. Danny checks his
      watch.

                               DANNY
                29:47.   Everything okay in there?

      Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him.
      But Rusty does, appearing behind him.

                              RUSTY
                But what doesn't beat the shit out
                of being a circus performer?

      Danny turns to Rusty:    he looks very, very serious.

                   You said you needed a reason.

                   When we started in this business,

                   gonna steal from anybody didn't
                   have it coming. And we were gonna
                   play the game like we had nothing
                   to lose. Well, I lost something.
                   Someone. That's why I'm here.

                   Here's the problem: we're
                   stealing two things now. And when
                   push comes to shove, if you can't
                   have both, which are you gonna
                   choose? And remember: Tess
                   doesn't divide eleven ways.

                   the one who has to make that
                   choice.

      The two men stand quietly for a moment.

      The painting hangs under a portrait lamp on a wall
      between a van Gogh and a Monet.

      At a distance, admiring it, are Tess, the SELLER and the
      seller's AIDE-DE-CAMP. A staff photographer and other
      personnel mill nearby.

      Off to the side, in a sharp blazer, Tess stands
      transfixed by the painting.

                                 TESS
                   You can see the conflict. He
                   makes her both erotic and
                   grotesque. He's hopelessly drawn
                   to her, and yet she drives him
                   crazy.

                          (to Seller)
                   Mr. Santaniello, I apologize if I
                   kept you. I had to iron out a few
                   issues with my fight promoter. I
                   gave him an unlimited budget, and
                   he exceeded it.

                                 SELLER
                   I understand it's going to be a
                   hell of a fight.

                                  BENEDICT
                   We hope.

      Tess angles Benedict toward the painting.

                                  TESS
                   Here it is.

      Benedict moves toward the painting, and as he does he
      catches Tess in his glance, and his smile deepens. Then:

                                 BENEDICT
                   Magnificent! I've been following
                   her for fifteen years now. At
                   last I've made her a home.
                          (to Tess)
                   All the arrangements and so
                   forth...

                                  SELLER
                   Done.   She's yours.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Not mine. She belongs to everyone
                   who comes into my hotel. Isn't
                   that right, Ms. Ocean?

                   Yes, Mr. Benedict.

                                 BENEDICT
                   She's lovely, isn't she?
                          (as the Seller is
                           confused; Benedict
                           specifies painting)
                   I can't be the only one who was
                   after her.

                                 SELLER
                   You're the only one who met my
                   price.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Ah, but this... You can't put a
                   price on beauty. But I shouldn't
                   philosophize. I own casinos,
                   after all.

                                 AIDE-DE-CAMP
                   Can we get a quick shot? Mr.
                   Santaniello has a plane to catch.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Of course, of course.

      Tess understands: she is not to be part of the photo.
      Benedict and the Seller pose together and...

      The Seller exits with the Aide-De-Camp in tow. Benedict
      remains, enthralled by the painting. Tess appears beside
      him.

                                  TESS
                   You like it?

                                 BENEDICT

                   I have some bad news from the
                   world of high fashion. It seems
                   Mike Tyson will be wearing red on
                   Saturday night. Red trunks with a
                   white stripe.

                                  TESS
                   Oh?

                   And you, as I recall, will be
                   wearing a red Donna Karan? And
                   when the TV cameras pick us up in
                   the front row, that red dress...

                                   TESS
                   I see.

                                 BENEDICT
                   He's a charming man, but no one's
                   going to be watching him when they
                   can make a study of you. I've
                   asked Paolo to find three or four
                   things for you to try. I hope
                   you're not too disappointed.

      She is, but she buries it.

                                   BENEDICT
                   Are you sure?

      She nods, smiles faintly.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I'll see you tonight.

      Instinctively she leans in to kiss him.        He recoils ever
      so slightly.

                                   TESS
                   What?    We're alone.

      He lets his eyes wander along the length of the ceiling,
      over all the eye-in-the-sky cameras hidden there. She
      follows his look.

                                 BENEDICT
                   In my hotels, there's always
                   someone watching.

      But he kisses her anyway.

                                 TESS
                   I'll see you tonight.

      He glances once more on the Picasso as he moves away.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Actually, I do like it.

      And Tess remains, thinking:         he's rich, he's handsome and
      wooing, but is she happy?

       Quiet, elegant, tense. One table is operating only, in
       the corner, and at it Saul, as Lyman Zerga, furtively
       peels at the roll of Rolaids and slips one in his mouth.

                               HIGH ROLLER #1
                 Weak stomach, Mr. Zerga?

                               SAUL
                 I don't believe in weakness. It
                 costs too much. I don't believe
                 in questions, either.

      This shuts the High Roller up fast. Saul looks up from
      the table, just perceptibly, to spot Terry Benedict, on
      his way in, right on schedule. He approaches the PIT
      BOSS by the entrance.

                                   BENEDICT

                   the third position. Wishes to
                   speak with you privately.

                                   BENEDICT
                   Who is he?

                                 PIT BOSS
                   Businessman of some kind, working
                   mostly in Europe. He's very
                   vague, but I asked around. Word
                   is he deals primarily in arms.
                   One of the biggest.

                                   BENEDICT
                   Zerga?    Never heard of him.

                                   PIT BOSS
                   Yessir.    That's why I don't doubt
                   it.

                                 BENEDICT
                   He's staying here?

                                 PIT BOSS
                   Checked in two nights ago, sir.
                   He's in the Mirador suite.

                   How's he doing?

                                  PIT BOSS
                   Up.   Almost forty grand.

                                TESS
                   I sold it. And I don't have a

      Danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but

                           apart)
                   -- whiskey.

                   You're doing a great job curating

      She sighs, exasperated.

                                 DANNY
                   The Vermeer is quite good. Simple
                   but vibrant. Although his work
                   definitely fell off as he got
                   older.

                   And I still get Monet and Manet
                   confused. Which one married his
                   mistress?

                                  TESS
                   Monet.

                                  DANNY
                   Right.   Manet had syphilis.

                   played this conversation out in my
                   head the last two years.

                                 TESS
                   Did it always go this poorly?

                   Yes.

                   Sounds frustrating.

                                 DANNY
                   You were never easy.
                          (as she shrugs)
                   Okay. I'll make this quick. I came
                   here for you. I'm gonna get on with
                   my life, and I want you with me.

                                 TESS
                   You're a thief and a liar.

                                 DANNY
                   I only lied about being a thief.
                   But I don't do that anymore.

                                  TESS

                                  TESS
                   Nice.   Work on that for two years, too?

108   INT. HIGH ROLLERS' ROOM - SAME TIME                               108

      At the table, Saul bets heavily for the bank. Benedict
      approaches, stands off to the right, watching.

                                 HIGH ROLLER
                          (to Saul, noticing his
                           heavy bet)
                   You don't want to get in the hole
                   too heavy to this Benedict. A
                   friend of mine once borrowed a
                   hundred g's from the guy. Two
                   months went by, Benedict hadn't
                   heard from him, he calls my friend
                   up, asks 'Where's my money?' I'll
                   get to it when I get to it,' my
                   friend says. Half hour later
                   Benedict's in my friend's hotel
                   room, dangling him off his 10th
                   floor balcony by his feet. 'You
                   gonna get to it now?'

      High Roller turns over a nine.     Saul wins.

                   And I have to impose on your
                   hospitality. Can you sit in for a
                   hand?

                   I'd love to, Mr. Zerga, but the
                   gaming board would feed me to my
                   white tigers.

                                 SAUL
                   That's a shame. You're the king
                   of Vegas and you have to play
                   craps in the alley.

                                 BENEDICT
                   No shame at all. Reminds me of my
                   youth.


      CORNER - MOMENT LATER

      Benedict and Saul are huddled in a corner.

                                 SAUL
                   The fight is Saturday, is it not?

                                  BENEDICT
                   Yes.   I can get you seats...

                                 SAUL
                   No, no. Hand-to-hand combat
                   doesn't interest me. I have a
                   package arriving here Saturday
                   evening. A black briefcase,
                   standard size, the contents of
                   which are very valuable to me.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I'd be happy to put it in the
                   house safe for you.

                                 SAUL
                   The house safe is for brandy and
                   grandmother's pearls. I'm afraid
                   I need something more secure.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I can assure you, the house safe
                   is utterly...

                          (his looks stops
                           Benedict)
                   I can assure you, Mr. Benedict,
                   your generosity in this matter
                   will not go overlooked. Now:
                   what can you offer me besides the
                   safe?

      Saul's eyes are pure steel: he is not a man familiar
      with being denied. And Benedict recognizes that fact.

                   whole again. I had to leave New

                   About the same. Everything you
                   want is still on the other side.

                                 BENEDICT
                   There's the human condition for
                   you.

                                 TESS
                   Terry, Danny was just about to...

                                 DANNY
                   I just wanted to say hello.   For
                   old time's sake.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Stay for a drink, if you like.

                                 TESS
                   He can't --

                          (simultaneously)
                   -- I can't.

      An awkward silence.    Benedict takes Tess's hand in his.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Well, then I don't imagine we'll
                   be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.

                                 DANNY
                   You never know.

                                 BENEDICT
                   I know everything that happens in
                   my hotels.

                                 DANNY
                   So I should put those towels back.

                                 BENEDICT
                   The towels you can keep.

      MOVING WITH Danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he
      saw the mist in Tess's eyes just now, he knows he's got a
      fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is...

      ... Linus is tailing him, ten steps back. He stops,
      glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then
      continues following Danny.


111   INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                            111

      Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg.
      Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles,
      whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an
      emerald shape. There's a KNOCK at the door...

                                 MAID (O.S.)
                   House cleaning.

                                 BASHER
                          (eyes never leave

                   Just jumping into the shower, can
                   you come back later?

      The maid moves on, on TV:     A Reporter broadcasts live...

                   We're here at the historic
                   Paradiso Hotel and Casino, once
                   the prize resort of Las Vegas, now
                   seconds away from demolition...

112   EXT. PARADISO HOTEL (ON STRIP) - DAY                        112

      Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity
      stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the
      Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino.

      A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry
      Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face
      in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her
      man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on
      his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny.

                              REPORTER
                ... and here's Reuben Tishkoff,
                former owner of the Paradiso, come
                to bid farewell to his fabled
                resort and wish Terry Benedict all
                the best with his future plans for
                the property...

      Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper
      reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but
      behind those smiles and under their breaths...

                              BENEDICT
                Good to see you.

                              REUBEN
                Go shit in your mouth.

      Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring
      back at her: Danny's. She holds his glance a moment --
      long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice --
      before turning away, to...

      ... Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps
      up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and
      together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and
      Benedict leans into a microphone...

                              BENEDICT
                I hope there's as much dynamite in
                the Paradiso as there will be in
                this Saturday's fight.

      ... and -- WHOOMPH -- the PLUNGER comes down and -- write
      your own onomatopoeia here -- the PARADISO IMPLODES.
      Reuben wipes a tear from his eye.

                              REUBEN
                G'bye, honey...


113   INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME                   113

      As the Paradiso crumbles outside his window, the lights
      and TV in his room flicker and go out.

                   Shit.

      FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING: Ten of our eleven (Basher
      is missing) surround the model of the three casinos.
      Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist...

                                 RUSTY
                   Call is at five-thirty. Makeup
                   and costume. Saul's package
                   arrives at seven-fifteen, and
                   Linus grabs our codes. All goes
                   well there and we're a go. Seven-
                   thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen
                   and we're committed. From that
                   point, we have thirty minutes to
                   blow the power or he suffocates.

      We DESCEND ONTO the miniature of the vault, then --

      FROM ABOVE, DESCENDING STILL: This is the Real Deal.
      The Bellagio vault. A clock reads: 8:03.

                                 RUSTY (V.O.)
                   Once the electricity goes, all
                   entry points to the vault and its
                   elevator will automatically lock
                   down for two minutes. That's when
                   we make our move...

      Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the
      vault's center and march out again, closing the thick
      metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK...

      ... We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There
      is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then...

      ... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen
      within, folded neatly.

      He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the
      cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes
      in the room: vacant and silent.

      Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously.

                                 RUSTY
                   Okay: they've put you in the
                   middle of the room, far from
                   everything. You have to get from
                   here to the door without touching
                   the floor. What do you do?

      A WIDER ANGLE reveals we're...


116   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         116

      The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and
      what we've been watching has been a trial run. Ten of
      the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is
      still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew
      watching a dress rehearsal.

                                 FRANK
                   Fin says he shorts it.

                                 LIVINGSTON
                   Make it a sawbuck.

      From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash
      cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with
      both hands without touching the floor. From this
      position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the
      door...

      Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to
      see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes
      -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage.

                                 BASHER
                          (and he's not happy)
                   We're in deep shit.


117   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         117

      Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he

      nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay...

                   Basher. What happened?


118   FLASHBACK - INT. VEGAS SEWERS - THAT AFTERNOON                  118

      A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse
      boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of
      effluent.

                                 BASHER (V.O.)
                   They did exactly what I planned to
                   do. Only they did it by accident.
                   Now they know their weakness. And
                   they're fixing it.

      An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city
      engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.


119   INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT)                   119

      Basher towels off his hair...

                   So unless we decide to do this job
                   in Reno, we're screwed.

      Danny rises and paces, frustrated.      He's come too far for
      things to go awry now.

                    We could use a pinch.

                    What -- is a pinch?

       Scientists demonstrate the pinch, a lithium wire in a
       glass vacuum tube the size of a small refrigerator.

                                  BASHER (V.O.)
                    A pinch is the equivalent of a
                    cardiac arrest for any broad-band
                    electrical circuitry. Or better
                    yet: A pinch is a bomb... but
                    without the bomb. Every time a
                    nuclear weapon detonates, it
                    unleashes an electromagnetic pulse
                    which shuts down any power source
                    within its vicinity. That tends
                    not to matter in most cases
                    because the nuclear weapon
                    destroys everything you might need
                    power for anyway. Now a pinch
                    creates a similar electromagnetic
                    pulse, but without the headache of
                    mass destruction and death. So
                    instead of Hiroshima, you get the
                    Seventeenth Century.

                    Could a pinch take out the power
                    of an entire city? Like, I

                    world big enough to handle it.

       Danny and Rusty trade a look:        They have their answer.

                                    DANNY

       Headlights hit a sign: "Cal Tech. HIGH-SECURITY AREA.
       KEEP OUT." A white VAN SHOOTS PAST it.

122    INT. WHITE VAN - NIGHT                                               122

       Turk and Virgil man the front seats as Danny, Basher, Yen
       and Linus huddle in the back. Basher and Yen both
       prepare equipment for their raid: hooks and a rope for
       Yen, a small blowtorch and a drill for Basher.

                                   DANNY
                           (to Basher and Yen)
                    You two ready?

       They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door.
       Linus starts to follow but...

                                  DANNY
                    What are you doing?

      Linus twiddles his thumbs, tired of being seated at the
      kids' table. Meanwhile, up front, another Mensa meeting
      has been called to order...

                   Mom told me she loves me more.

                   She told me she was going to tell
                   you that.

                                  TURK (O.S.)
                   Stop it.

                                  VIRGIL (O.S.)
                   Make me.

                                  VIRGIL (O.S.)
                   Make me.

      They can be heard WRESTLING. Linus has had enough.     He
      sneaks out the van's back door without the Malloys
      hearing him.


125   AT PERIMETER DOOR                                              125

      Linus sulks along the laboratory's perimeter, finds the
      door Danny pick-locked, and disappears inside.

      A moment passes.

      A moment passes.

      And the next door opens, and Danny, Basher, and Yen
      appear, pinch in hand -- they've succeeded. They weave a
      path to the van...


126   INT. VAN                                                       126

      Turk and Virgil are still wrestling as the trio appears.
      Danny, Basher and Yen pile in the back...

                                  DANNY
                   We got it.   Let's go.

      Turk floors it, and they're off.

      Turk brakes, and they're not.

                                    DANNY
                   Where's Linus?

      Everyone realizes:    he's not here.   Just then:

      SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life.      Uh-oh.

      Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by
      his side. His eyes scan the compound, then:

                                    DANNY
                   There he is.


      DANNY'S POV

      of the lab, and its beveled-glass stairwell. Linus
      scrambles up its steps, a flight ahead of a duo of chasing
      guards. As he ascends out of sight...

      Danny shifts his focus to -


      DANNY'S POV

      The other side of the building, and two more guards
      arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase:
      Linus will be trapped.


      BACK TO SCENE

      Danny, Basher, and Yen squat side-by-side-by-side,
      watching all this. Yen makes a colorful observation about
      Linus's predicament; of course, no one understands it.

                                 VIRGIL (O.S.)
                   One of us should help him.

       Both sets of guards appear on the rooftop, and find no
       Linus between them -- he's disappeared.

                    Where'd he go?


       BACK TO SCENE

       Danny and Basher slowly turn: Turk and Virgil crouch
       inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.

                                   TURK

       through it, followed shortly by Linus who leaps onto a
       steel-mesh overhang running alongside the building.

       does so before the rear doors are closed, and one of them

      Lost in the luxury his role dictates, Saul floats in a
      full-sized Jacuzzi and chews on a hundred dollar cigar;
      Reuben, meanwhile, paces the floor, nervously.

                Where are they? That's what I

      Punching up a new set of views from the Eye In The Sky,
      Livingston thrusts forward, alarmed by one.

      He glances at his watch, then outside again as the white
      van arrives, dropping off only Linus and Danny, who slaps
      the van's roof before it pulls away.

      As Danny and Linus enter the lobby, Rusty falls into step
      with them, exchanging a smile with Danny but not Linus,
      he still looks chastised from the car-trailer.

                   You boys have a nice trip?

      Rusty, smiling, looks to Linus, glowering, then to Danny.
      Before Danny can explain the doors part at the Mirador
      Suite, where Livingston greets them urgently.

                                 LIVINGSTON
                   We have a problem.

      A mug-shot of Danny, complete with vital information:
      height, weight, criminal history.

                                 LIVINGSTON
                   You've been red-flagged. It means
                   the moment you step on the casino
                   floor, they'll be watching you.
                   Like hawks. Hawks with video

                                 DANNY
                   This is a problem.

      A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem,
      this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise,
      HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.

                                  RUSTY
                   Saul:   time to get out.

                   I do. He's been chasing
                   Benedict's woman. Got into a real
                   snarl with him two nights ago.
                          (off Danny's look)
                   I was tailing you.

                   It's that or we shut down right
                   now. His involvement puts us all
                   at risk.

      Danny and Rusty face off, furious with each other.

                                 DANNY
                   This isn't your call.

                                 RUSTY
                   You made it my call. When you put
                   her ahead of us. You made it mine.

                                 DANNY
                   This is my job.

                                  RUSTY
                   Not anymore.

      Danny stares daggers at Rusty. But he can see: everyone
      in the room is on Rusty's side. Defeated, he stalks out
      of the room, onto a balcony, but not without staring down
      Linus.

                                 TISHKOFF
                   But, but... he can't just be out.
                   Who's gonna take his place?

      Rusty turns to Linus.

                                 RUSTY
                   Kid, you up for it?

      Linus's eyes drift to Danny outside -- whatever acrimony
      he felt before, he never meant to kick Danny off the job.
      He nods, half-cocksure/half-scared-pissless: he's up for
      it.

                                 RUSTY
                          (to Livingston)
                   Find everyone else. Let 'em know
                   the change in plan. Curtain goes
                   up at seven.

      Livingston exits. Everyone else in the room staggers
      about, like witnesses after an execution. Rusty steps
      out onto the balcony, perhaps to console Danny, but (as
      Linus watches them from inside) their words cannot be
      heard.

      Tess, readying herself for the big evening, meets her own
      glance in a dressing mirror, then spots Benedict in its
      reflection, pacing the bedroom behind her.

      From behind, Terry Benedict approaches, two security
      guards walking half a pace behind him. Saul spots him in

      A white, unmarked van pulls in from the street and races
      up to the curb where Saul and Benedict wait.

      Turk Malloy gets out the passenger's side, a briefcase
      handcuffed to his wrist, as Virgil comes around from the
      driver's side, both of them dressed in their bodyguard
      suits.

                               TURK
                Mr. Zerga.   A gift from Mr. Hesse.

      Turk extends the briefcase to Saul, so that they both
      clasp the handle, as Virgil produces a key, unlocks the
      cuff on Turk's wrist, transfers it to Saul's, clamps it
      shut, and hands Saul the key.

                              SAUL

      He turns, nods to Benedict, and they retreat into the
      hotel, the security guards and Malloys flanking them.

                   Of course not.

      Saul turns to dismiss Virgil and Turk when...

      ... passing by, on his way to a sports betting window, an
      old RACETRACK DENIZEN happens past this cabal and, worse
      yet, happens to recognize Saul.

                                  RACETRACK DENIZEN
                   Saul?   Saul Bloom, is that you?

      Saul does his best to ignore the man. But even Benedict
      notices: this guy seems to know Lyman Zerga.

                                 RACETRACK DENIZEN
                   Saul, it's me. Bucky Buchanan,
                   remember? From Saratoga.

      At last Saul turns to face this man, with shark's eyes.

                                 SAUL
                   Friedrich, Gunther.

      An order: dispose of this man. Virgil and Turk pick up
      the Denizen by his elbows and haul him away.

                                 SAUL
                   Mr. Benedict...

       Linus stands dressed in a sharp, conservative suit -- a
       far cry from the threadbare thief in Chicago. Rusty
       circles him, inspecting.

                                  RUSTY
                    Where you gonna put your hands?

                    No...

       Linus goes for his pockets.

                                  RUSTY
                    Not the pockets, either. And

       Linus does.

                    That how you gonna stand?

       Linus shifts his balance.

                                  RUSTY
                    Wrong again. I ask you a

       Of which, importantly, we never see the exterior, just an
       air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror...

       The white VAN SCREECHES to a halt inches from Basher who
       stands ready beside the pinch (and the now-gutted and
       dismantled mockup of the Bellagio vault) and faster than
       a NASCAR pit crew Basher, Turk and Virgil load the pinch
       into the white van's rear and before you can say
       "electromagnetic pulse" the VAN SCREECHES back out of the
       warehouse fully loaded.

       The room is empty save for a large table. Saul places
       his briefcase on it, adjusts its numbered combination
       locks, and opens it.

       Inside the case:    five rows of glittering emeralds.

                   They're very beautiful.   A gift.

      Saul stares at him:     none of your fucking business.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Can you lift them out, please?

      Saul lifts the velvet tray out of the case, and Benedict
      pats down the case's interior. Saul replaces the tray.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Alright, Mr. Zerga. I acknowledge
                   that the case does not contain any
                   dangerous or illicit material. I

      There is a KNOCK at the door, and Walsh the casino
      manager enters. He speaks low in Benedict's ear.

                                 WALSH (MANAGER)
                   I put two plainclothes on Ocean.
                   He's at the keno bar now.

      Walsh nods, and Benedict turns back to Saul.

                   Mr. Zerga, this is Mr. Walsh, my
                   casino manager. If you will allow,
                   he will arrange for your briefcase
                   to be stored inside our vault while
                   you watch on a security monitor.
                          (beat)
                   Those are my terms. Yes or no?

      Saul and Benedict eyeball each other.

                   You leave me no choice.

      Saul unlocks the cuff from his wrist.

      clothed room service cart inside as Basher pulls away.

      side, OVER hands flexing and stretching, UP TO Linus
      Caldwell. He keeps an eye on the cage door, waiting for
      Benedict to appear, as he tries anything to shake out his
      nerves. Then, from a discreet earpiece he wears, comes:

      Rusty checks through the peephole, then ushers in Turk
      and Virgil in costume with their room service cart.

                                 TURK
                   Who ordered the penne?

      Livingston raises a hand, and as Turk serves him his
      plate, Virgil whips off the cart's tablecloth:
      underneath it's the false-lid cash cart. Rusty turns to
      a corner.

                                   RUSTY

      Fat and Slim sit before their monitors, feet kicked up,

      Walsh, finding Fat and Slim as they are, coughs; the two

      his watch.

      a tug: it's shut tight. As Virgil redresses it with the
      tablecloth, Turk snatches back Livingston's penne on the
      way to the door.

      Pit Boss's station.
                              LINUS
                It only came to our attention this
                morning, Mr. Benedict. Apparently
                he has a record longer than my
                arm.

                                 BENEDICT
                   If he is who you say he is.

                   Certainly, Mr. Benedict.

      Benedict and Linus wait, side-by-side. While Linus does
      his best to play it cool, Benedict dips into his
      portfolio.

      An overhead view of Benedict as he pulls out the
      combination to the vault, reads it, then buries it in his
      jacket pocket.

                          (into his microphone)
                   We missed it, Linus. You gotta
                   grab the combination yourself.

      Linus half-nods in response, and Benedict notices.
      Suspicious of the young man, he decides to test him.

                                 BENEDICT
                   You new at the commission?

                   I know Hal Lindley over there.
                   You work with him at all?

                           pass?)
                   Not since he died last year.

      He passes.    The Pit Boss returns with Frank in tow.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Mr. Escalante. Would you come
                   with us, please?

                   I think it's better if we talked
                   off the floor.

      Linus and Benedict lead Frank away.       As they pass an
      elevator...

      ... its doors open, revealing Turk and Virgil, dressed
      now as security guards, pushing out the false-lid cash
      cart. They leave behind a pile of dishes, waiter
      uniforms, a tablecloth.

      and counting. A MAITRE D' scours his reservations list,
      then peers up to find Reuben Tishkoff approaching, on
      either side of him two gorgeous young women, all blonde
      hair and breasts and legs, women who wouldn't give Hefner
      the time of day.

                                 MAITRE D'
                   Good evening, Mr. Tishkoff.

                                 TISHKOFF
                   Good evening, Marcel. My nieces
                   and I would like a table.
                   Something quiet before the fight.

                                 MAITRE D'
                   I can put you at 19 in just a
                   couple minutes.

                                 TISHKOFF
                   Quick as you can.
                          (re: the girls)
                   The meter's running here.

      The Maitre d' turns to his next customer:         Tess.   She, of
      course, merits a table instantly.

                                 MAITRE D'
                   Good evening, Miss Ocean.    Right
                   this way...

      Reuben can't help but stare as Tess passes by. His eyes
      linger a little too long and a little too low...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Hey...

      Reuben pivots; it's Danny, and he strolls past Reuben and
      his lady friends and into the restaurant...

      Just as she's sitting, Danny approaches.       She goes
      straight at him, apoplectic.

                                   TESS
                   Danny:    No.

                                 DANNY
                   I'll just be a moment.

                                 TESS
                   I'm having you thrown out of
                   here.

      She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and
      she wheels on him.

                                 TESS
                   You're up to something, Danny.
                   What? And don't say you came here
                   for me. You're pulling a job,
                   aren't you?

                                   DANNY

                                 TESS
                   Well, know this: no matter what
                   it is, you won't win me back. I
                   can't afford it.

                                 DANNY
                   I just came to say good-bye.

      This surprises Tess, and, truth be told, saddens her; she
      studies him a moment, unsure of what to say.

                                 TESS
                   Oh... then... good-bye.

                                   DANNY
                   Good-bye.

      Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
      with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then
      gently kisses it...

                                   DANNY
                   Be good.

      Danny leaves her.       Tess watches him go.

                          (already missing him)
                   Good-bye, Danny.

                                 PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1
                   Mr. Ocean. Mr. Benedict would

                          (resignedly, these men
                           are much too big to
                           tangle with)
                   I thought he might.

      The Plainclothes Goons escort Danny away, right past
      Reuben who frowns, concerned.

                   race has anything to do with this.

                   Virgil, Turk: deliver your
                   package.


172   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - BY CAGE DOOR - 14:05                     172

      Two guards stand sentry outside the cage door. Virgil
      and Turk move up with their cash cart, and when Virgil
      reaches for his keycard... it's gone.

                                 VIRGIL
                   Aw, I think... Jesus.    I lost my
                   card.

      The guards frown at him.     A SECURITY OFFICER approaches.

                                 SECURITY OFFICER
                   What's going on here?

                                 VIRGIL
                   I think... Jesus! I lost my
                   keycard.

                                  SECURITY OFFICER
                           (and this, he knows, will
                            get this guard fired)
                   Okay.   Leave the cart. Go find
                   it.
                          (to one of the
                           sentries)
                   Take this cart inside.

      The sentry nods, swipes his keycard, and enters with the
      cash cart. Turk and Virgil hesitate a moment to watch it
      enter, then hurry off.

      corridor. On another: Saul's briefcase is escorted by
      another guard to the vault elevator. On another: Danny
      is escorted inside the cage by the Plainclothes Goons.

                              WALSH

      The yen-filled cash cart joins Saul's briefcase on the
      elevator. PULL OUT to...

      and counting. Benedict exits the casino Manager's office
      with Linus and Frank. Benedict hails two GUARDS...

                              BENEDICT
                Please show this man off the
                premises.
                       (to Frank)
                Don't step foot in my casino
                again.

                               FRANK
                       (as he's led away,
                         over his shoulder,
                         to Linus)
                Cracker.

      Benedict checks his watch again:    he's really running
      late.

                              BENEDICT
                Mr. Wills, if you don't mind...
                       (as Linus forgets
                        to respond)
                Mr. Wills?

                               LINUS
                Of course.

      They start toward the exit.   But halfway there...

                               LINUS
                My beeper.   I'm sorry.   I forgot
                it.

      Benedict hesitates: He's in an enormous hurry now, he's
      behind schedule -- he hates being behind schedule -- but
      leaving even a member of the Gaming Commission alone in
      his cage is a security risk. One glace at the cameras
      all about and he decides to risk it.

                              BENEDICT
                You know how to get back out?

                               LINUS
                Of course.   Enjoy the fight.

                              BENEDICT
                       (shaking his hand,
                        then hurrying away)
                Thank you.

      Linus smiles after him, withdrawing the page of
      combinations he lifted off the man.

      to tip them...

                              FRANK
                Thanks, fellas.

      ... but they snarl at him before returning inside.   Frank
      smiles and goes on his way, his job complete.


178   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - 06:36                                   178

      Danny sits opposite two Plainclothes Goons in absolute
      silence, waiting.

                              DANNY
                How much longer do you think Mr.
                Benedict will be?

                              GOON #1
                Just a few minutes more.

      He scans the room.

                              DANNY
                No cameras in this room, huh?
                Don't want anyone seeing what
                happens here?

      The Goons say nothing.   Danny checks his watch.

                              DANNY
                He's not coming, is he?

      The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their
      bluff.

                               DANNY
                Who is?

      There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile:
      Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher
      in...

      ... the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of Danny
      Ocean. The guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds,
      but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his
      teeth...

      ... or the lack thereof; the Bruiser doesn't hold a
      single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. Gum
      city. And there's something really terrifying about the
      sight.

                                 DANNY
                   I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like
                   me talking to his girl.

      The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the
      Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those
      gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a
      hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.

                                 GOON #1
                   We're gonna step outside now.
                   Leave you two alone to talk things
                   over.

      The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as
      Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes
      out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little
      blood from his lip.

                                 DANNY
                   Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.

                                   BRUISER
                   Sorry, Danny.    I -- I forgot.

                                   DANNY
                   S'okay.
                          (shaking it off)
                   How's the wife?

                                 BRUISER
                   Pregnant again.

                                 DANNY
                   Then we better get to work.

      through the ceiling rafters, groaning every time Bruiser
      slaps his fist into his hand.

       A guard wheels in the Yen-filled cash cart, parks it in
       a station next to its twin, then -- as an afterthought --
       plants Saul's briefcase right on top if it -- clunk -- an

       Saul witnesses this, too, and stifles a reaction.

                                  WALSH
                    Does that satisfy you, Mr. Zerga?

                    Close it up.

       On the monitor, the vault door closes, but Saul looks
       anything but satisfied. He's sweaty, his mouth's so dry
       he can't swallow, and he keeps patting down his pockets
       for his Rolaids, without finding them.

      Linus immediately reaches up to the elevator's ceiling,
      rips down its panel to reveal a trap door. As he starts
      to push it open...

      ... a hand yanks it free from above.    It's Danny.

                              DANNY
                You didn't really think I was

                 Hell, I think Reuben bought it,

                 Bobby Caldwell threw me into the
                 pool first time. Least I could do
                 is give his kid a push.

                 Why'd you make me go through all

       Danny leads Linus down and around the elevator and side-
       by-side they crawl onto the bottom of the elevator,
       gripping the undercarriage of the lift to keep from
       falling. Meanwhile, we DESCEND QUICKLY DOWN the shaft,
       just to illustrate how very high up they are.


192    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - 00:53                              192

       Rusty, playing doctor, inspects Saul. At the same time,
       he inspects a monitor: the vault door closing with the
       Yen-filled cash cart and Saul's briefcase inside.

       Rusty stops, listens to Saul's chest, then drops his
       head...

                                  RUSTY
                    He's gone.

       Walsh, Fat and Slim all bow their heads.     At the door,
       two paramedics arrive with a stretcher.

                                  WALSH
                    You're too late, guys.   He's dead.

       The first paramedic turns to his partner and admonishes
       him:

                                  VIRGIL
                           (to Turk)

                                    DANNY
                    A buck it is.

       And they're ready, poised at the top, looking into the
       abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared
       sensors.

      The opening BELL RINGS -- round one. The fighters break
      from their corners, feinting, jabbing...

      Sitting ringside: Benedict looks at Tess and smiles as
      she winces at the first sharp blow.


197   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - BELOW ELEVATOR - 00:05                   197

      Peering down into blackness, Danny and Linus prepare to

                                 LINUS
                   You ever rappelled before?

      reach back, both going for the lights-out power cut to

203   HURTLING WITH DANNY AND LINUS                                 203

      DOWN the elevator shaft.

      Upside down, heads curled, and all we hear is the WHOOSH
      of their bodies in motion and the WHIRL of their CORDS
      UNCOILING.

      Coming to a rest about ten feet from the floor, Danny
      quickly pulls a slim blade and slashes the two coils
      straight across. He and Linus go tumbling to the floor
      as their drop lines recoil lightning fast to their
      elevator anchors, just before...

      ... the infrared lights go back on-line.

      The lights suddenly flash back on, revealing...

      ... both fighters standing, and Tyson takes advantage of
      Lewis's disorientation and throws a sucker punch to his
      jaw. Down goes Lewis, and up goes the crowd, roaring.

      his empire: he smells a rat. His eyes fall on Reuben
      behind him, but Reuben just shrugs: "I didn't pull the

      Linus and Danny arise from where they've fallen,
      clutching their heads and rubbing bruises. Danny doesn't
      recover as quickly.

      ... the false lid of the cash cart thrust upward
      slightly. It's Yen trying to get out, out of air and
      only now alert to Saul's heavy case resting atop him.

      Livingston watches this on his monitors, just coming

      and Livingston presses play.


      ON MONITOR A

      Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the
      three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty. And of the vault
      itself: Yen trying to get out of the cash cart.


      ON MONITOR B

      Overhead security-cam view of the vault corridor: the
      three Uzi guards stand idly, on duty... and in totally
      different positions. Of the vault: no cash cart, but no
      Zerga briefcase, no Yen.

      unnoticed.

       Yen continues to push up on the cash cart lid, and the
       more he pushes, the more Saul's briefcase slides off.
       Yen stretches his hand out to grab it, but it's slid
       beyond his reach, to the edge of falling.


B215   INT. CORRIDOR/OUTSIDE VAULT                                     B215

       The Uzi-Carrying Guards turn their backs to the elevator
       shaft...

       ... and Linus and Danny appear in the doorway; they both
       snap gas pellets and slide them into the corridor.

                                  UZI-CARRYING GUARD #1

                    Jesus, Ron, was that you?


215    OUTSIDE VAULT CORRIDOR                                          215

       Linus and Danny wait, Danny silently mouthing a three-
       count before... THUD, THUD, THUD. They peer around the
       corridor to find...

       All three Uzi-carrying guards lie unconscious on the
       ground. Linus starts in, Danny holds him back...

                                   DANNY
                    Not yet.

216    INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                             216

       Danny and Linus enter, waving the faint remnants of the
       gas from their noses, tiptoeing past the guards' bodies.

                                  LINUS
                    You think Yen made it out okay?

                                  DANNY
                    I'm sure he's fine.

A217   INT. VAULT                                                  A217

       Saul's briefcase inches closer to falling off the cash cart,
       which of course would trigger the floor sensor and terminate
       this heist here and now. Yen's hand stretches farther out to
       grab it, pushing up just a little more on the false lid
       until...

       ... the briefcase tumbles toward the floor...

       ... but not before Yen snags the handcuff chain attached to
       it and swings it round. He's got it. That threat over, he
       throws open the cash cart lid and takes the biggest breath
       of his life.


B217   INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                         B217

       Linus punches in the code for the door to the vault
       anteroom (the one he stole from Benedict). He steps back
       as it slides open, revealing --

       -- the vault door:     it is sleek and immense and
       impregnable.

                                  LINUS
                           (jaw dropping)
                    Jesus...

                                  DANNY
                    There's a Chinese man with a
                    hundred sixty million dollars
                    behind that door. Let's get him
                    out.

       Danny takes a flat hand and slaps the door hard.

       Yen now sits perched atop the cash cart, Saul's briefcase
       opened beside him (he has removed half of Lyman's
       "emeralds"). He hears the muffled Danny's slaps and he
       knows: it's time for his leap. It's the same distance
       as the leap he made in the practice session, but this
       time he's only got one good hand.

      Yen prepares for his leap, then springs...

      ... across the room, to the ledge he must grab...

      ... and he grabs it, but with only one hand he's slipping
      right away, and in a second he'll hit the sensored
      floor...

      ... but, in a flash, he spins and splits his legs,
      propping himself up between two walls, inches above the
      floor. An acrobatic wonder.


220   INT. MIRADOR SUITE                                           220

      Frank and Livingston exhale.

      Danny, oblivious to this close call, slaps the door
      again. A moment passes, then: Yen responds with a slap,
      too.

                                  DANNY
                   Okay.


222   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   222

      As Basher enters, Livingston and Frank watch on a monitor
      Linus punching in the combination he stole from Benedict
      as Danny unravels a thin electrical wire connected to a
      detonator.

                                  FRANK
                   That's it?

                                 LIVINGSTON
                   There's still the five pins and
                   the floor sensor. Not much we can
                   do about that from this side of
                   the door. But from this side...

      He punches up the image of Yen in the vault.

                                 BASHER
                   ... a little bit of Semtex should

       Yen sets the last of Lyman's emeralds against the vault
       door like a plastic explosive... which, of course, it is.
       He affixes a detonator receiver (the size of a golf ball
       pencil) to it, then slaps the door twice: all set.


A224   OUTSIDE VAULT                                                  A224

       Danny responds with two slaps of his own. He steps
       back, detonator in hand, its wires attached to the vault
       door.

                                   DANNY
                    Counting down from twenty --

                    -- now.

       Yen starts his retreat from the door, but gets yanked
       back.

       His hand's bandage is caught on the door.

       Yen tries to free himself, but he can't use his other
       hand lest he drop to the floor. He tries gnawing at
       his bandage, which brings his face within inches of a
       plastic explosive.

        Yen, still on the door, remains frozen.       Trembling.

        A beat.

        Then, he starts to creep back, leaping onto a money
        shelf, then another, as far from the explosives as he
        can get.

       disbelief...

       Saul enters, alive and dressed as himself again.      His
       job is complete.

                    Everything going okay?


225    INT. VAULT CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE VAULT                              225

       As Danny checks his batteries (the types with built-in
       power meters: both at zero percent), Linus ransacks the
       Uzi-carrying Guards' gear for replacements. He finds
       AA's in their flashlights.

                                  LINUS
                    You know, you lose focus for one
                    second in this game --

                                  DANNY
                    -- and someone gets hurt, yeah
                    yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining.

       He takes the batteries, inserts them in his detonator,
       then slaps the door twice more.

       Yen catches his breath on the far end of the room. He
       hears the slap, rolls his eyes, and ducks out of the
       line of fire.

       pauses...

       Danny and Linus enter. Silence. The cash carts have
       crumpled, and the vault gratings, blackened, have held.

       Yen pops up from within, his hair on end, looking like he
       just dropped out of a cyclone.

      MOVING WITH Benedict and Tess, pushing their way out
      through the crowd. A PHONE is RINGING nearby... again
      and again...

                               BENEDICT
                 You gonna answer it?

                 I don't have a cell phone.

      They keep moving, but the RING pursues them. Finally,
      Benedict stops, pulls Tess's purse from her shoulder and
      opens it: inside, he finds a CELL PHONE, RINGING.

                                  TESS
                 It isn't mine.

                               BENEDICT
                 See who's on the other end.

      She takes the phone, activates it.

                 It's for you.

      Benedict takes the phone.

                 Who the hell is this?

230   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               230

      Benedict enters, and fear enters with him. And, of
      course, Tess. As the room buzzes with activity, he keeps
      the cell phone pressed to his ear.

                              BENEDICT
                What the hell is going on down
                there in the vault?

                                FAT
                Nothing, sir.    All normal.

                                BENEDICT
                Show me.

      Fat points to the security-cam view of the vault corridor
      and vault -- Livingston's tape.

                                FAT
                All quiet.

                              BENEDICT
                       (on phone,
                        venomously)
                I'm afraid you're mistaken.


231   INT. MIRADOR SUITE - NIGHT                                   231

      Frank, Basher and Saul watch over Livingston's shoulder
      as this phone conversation is broadcast over a small
      speaker.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                You're watching your monitor?
                Okay, keep watching.

      Livingston punches in numbers...


232   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY -             232
      ON FAT'S MONITOR

      New images suddenly appear. Three masked men in the
      vault throw stacks of money onto the floor; the three Uzi
      Guards lie bound and unconscious in the corridor.

      The security center, understandably, erupts in activity.

                              BENEDICT

233    INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                   233

       Rusty strolls so casually there's no reason anyone
       passing would suspect he was doing more than ordering a
       pizza.

                               RUSTY (V.O.)
                 In this town, your luck can change
                 just that quickly.


234    INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER                                  234

                               BENEDICT
                        (close to apoplectic,
                         takes a breath and
                         cups the phone, then
                         barks at Walsh)
                 Find out how much money we have
                 down there.

       Tess, amid all this chaos, is still curious: how did
       that cell phone get into her handbag? And suddenly it
       hits her...


A235   FLASHBACK - INT. RESTAURANT - EARLIER THAT EVENING             A235

                               DANNY
                 Good-bye.

       Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
       with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then
       gently kisses it...

       ... as he slips the cell phone into her handbag,
       unnoticed.

                               BENEDICT
                        (on phone)
                 Alright. You've proved your
                 point. You've broken into my
                 vault. Congratulations: you're a
                 dead man.

       Tess leaves.

                               RUSTY (V.O.)
                 Maybe.

                               BENEDICT
                 May I ask: how do you expect to
                 leave here, hmm?

       INTERCUT WITH:


235    INT. CASINO FLOOR                                              235

                        BENEDICT
          Do you believe I'll simply allow
          you to parade bags full of my
          money out my casino doors?

A distance beyond Rusty, Tess exits the cages. She
stops, puzzling over what to do, happens to spot him.

                         RUSTY
          No.   You're gonna carry it out for
          us.

                        BENEDICT
                 (has to laugh)
          And why would I do that?

                        RUSTY
          Take a closer look at your
          monitor...

      OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                              128A.

236   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                         236

      Benedict does. As the three masked men stuff money into
      large canvas bags and mark the bags with X's, another
      portion of cash remains untouched, booby-trapped.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                As your manager's probably
                reporting to you by now, you have
                a little over a hundred sixty
                million in your vault tonight.

      And, as if Rusty was in the room watching, Walsh
      approaches with the night's cash count: $163,156,759.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                You may notice: we're only
                packing up about half that. The
                other half we're leaving in your
                vault, booby-trapped, as a
                hostage.


237   INT. CASINO FLOOR                                            237

                              RUSTY
                You let our eighty million go, and
                you get to keep your eighty.
                That's the deal. You try and stop
                us, we'll blow both cash loads.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              129.

237   CONTINUED:                                                     237

      He spins and -- gasp -- comes face-to-face with Tess.
      She stares at him directly: she knows.

                                  RUSTY
                          (holding her glance)
                   Mr. Benedict: you can lose eighty
                   million dollars secretly tonight
                   or you can lose a hundred sixty
                   million dollars publicly. It's
                   your decision.

      He cups the phone.

                                   RUSTY
                   Hi.


238   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                           238

      Benedict cups his phone, too, and vents his rage. He
      knows what he should do -- let the money go -- and he
      knows what he wants to do -- stop these sonsabitches.   He
      makes his choice...

                                  BENEDICT
                          (to Walsh)
                   Make the call.

      Walsh grabs a phone, punches numbers...

      Livingston listens in on the call...

                                 WALSH (V.O.)
                   Hello, this is Mr. Walsh at the

                            phone)
                   Okay.   You have a deal.

      Tess and Rusty hold a stare as Rusty holds the phone.

                                 TESS
                Where's Danny?

                              RUSTY
                He's fine. He wants you to go
                upstairs, and watch TV.

                              TESS
                       (a little pissed)
                He does?

                              BENEDICT (V.O.)
                You have a deal.

                              RUSTY
                It's alright, Tess. I promise.
                       (back on phone)
                Good. Here's what you do. Five
                minutes from now, the men in the
                vault are going to deposit six
                bags in the vault elevator.

      Tess isn't sure what to do. As Rusty continues on the
      phone, she backs off, debating: can she blow the whistle
      on her ex?


242   INT. VAULT ELEVATOR - CLOSE ON SIX CANVAS BAGS                 242

      each sealed tight, each marked with an X, loaded onto
      the vault elevator.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                If they meet anyone, we'll blow
                the money in the bags and the
                money in the vault.


243   INT. CAGE - OUTSIDE VAULT ELEVATOR                             243

      A small cadre of guards await the arrival of the vault
      elevator. Its doors open to reveal the six large canvas
      bags, each sealed tight, marked with an X.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                One minute after that, the
                elevator will rise to your cages.
                Six of your guards will pick up
                the bags and carry them out into
                the casino.

      Six guards do precisely that.

                                                               131.

244   INT. CASINO - NIGHT                                             244

      MOVING WITH Rusty PAST slot machines...

                              RUSTY
                If they take more than twenty
                seconds to reach the casino floor
                or if there's any indication a
                switch has been made, we'll blow
                the money in the vault and the
                money in the bags.

      A SLOT MACHINE RINGS behind him...


245   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  245

      ... and Benedict hears it.

                              BENEDICT
                       (to Walsh)
                He's in the casino right now.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                Of course, I'm in the casino. In
                fact, I'm staying in your hotel.
                And I have two words for you:
                mini-bar.
                       (back to business)
                Now as soon as your guards hit the
                casino floor...


246   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    246

      The six guards appear from the cage door, carrying six
      canvas bags marked with X's; Bellagio security escorts
      them from the building.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                ... a white unmarked van is going
                to pull up in your valet station.


247   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT                                    247

      The white VAN (now clean of the "Nevada Telecom" sign)
      IDLES before the Bellagio, its windows tinted, the
      driver's identity inscrutable. It is swarmed by
      security, but they maintain a wide perimeter.

                              RUSTY (V.O.)
                Your guards will load the bags
                into the van's rear. If anyone so
                much as approaches the driver's
                door, we blow everything.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

247   CONTINUED:                                                   247

      The guards carry out the money and load it into the van's
      rear. There, they find a video camera mounted within the
      back seat of the van monitoring them. Still they cannot
      catch a glimpse of the driver. They close the van doors.


248   BELLAGIO - FROM HIGH ABOVE                                   248

      The white van departs the valet station in front,
      clandestinely shadowed by five sedans. Meanwhile, behind
      the casino, a SWAT van arrives and unloads its squad.

                                  BENEDICT (V.O.)
                   Now what?

                                 RUSTY (V.O.)
                   Now, when I get word that the van
                   hasn't been followed, that the
                   money is secure, my men will exit
                   the building, and once their
                   safety is confirmed, you'll get
                   your vault back.

249   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               249

      Walsh mouths to Benedict: "SWAT team is here."   Benedict
      nods and throws him a thumbs-up.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Sir, I have complied with your
                   every request, would you agree?

                                  RUSTY (V.O.)
                   I would.

                                  BENEDICT
                   Good.   Now I have one of my own.

                                  RUSTY (V.O.)
                   Yes?

                                 BENEDICT
                          (at last, his venom
                           released)
                   Run and hide. If you get picked
                   up next week buying a $100,000
                   sports car in Newport Beach, I'll
                   be supremely disappointed.
                   Because I want my people to find
                   you. And rest assured: when they
                   do, they won't hand you over to
                   the police.
                          (beat)
                   Run and hide. That's all I ask.

      And during the above rant by Benedict, we view...

       now empty, Livingston's monitors still displaying the
       masked men in the vault.


251    WHITE VAN                                                       251

       navigating the streets of Las Vegas.


252    FIVE SEDANS                                                     252

       tailing the van, security goons piled into each, and
       maybe we NOTICE (or maybe not) the Rolls-Royce tailing
       them.


253    TESS                                                            253

       pacing in Benedict's suite, biting her nails, debating
       whether to blow the whistle on Danny. ON TV: a newscast
       of the contentious aftermath of the prize fight.


A254   UZI GUARDS,                                                     A254

       bound and unarmed, unconscious to the activity within the
       vault.


254    RUSTY'S CELL PHONE                                              254

       listens -- the line has gone dead.   He hangs up.

                                 WALSH
                   Our guys say the van is headed
                   toward McCarren Airport.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Get everyone in position. I want
                   my vault back before that van hits
                   the tarmac.


       LONGER MONTAGE now, CUTTING BETWEEN:

       (six in all) hustling through the cage corridors, armed
       to the teeth, with body armor and helmets and vision
       guards: they're as faceless as storm troopers.

257    MONITORS OF THE VAULT                                          257

                           inspection)
                   Where's Zerga?
                          (off Walsh's sheepish
                           look)
                   Mr. Zerga? With the briefcase?

                                 WALSH
                   He's -- he died.

       Benedict shoots him a slow, sideways glance.

       rappelling down the elevator shaft -- its ultraviolet
       sensors turned off by Walsh -- then moving into
       position...

                   Ready when you are.

       Benedict scours the monitors: The masked men continue to
       pace on one screen. The SWAT team prepares to invade on
       another.

                                    BENEDICT
                   Do it.

                                    SWAT LEADER (V.O.)
                             (over radio)
                   Cut it.

      Livingston's monitors all go black.


261   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY                  261

      The monitors here go black as well.   Benedict listens
      closely to the SWAT frequency.

                              SWAT FREQUENCY (V.O.)
                       (Leader's voice)

                        PANTING, then Linus's
                        voice, distant and
                        panicked)
                Guys, someone's here!
                       (Leader's voice)
                Take him down! Now!

      A brief SPURT of GUNFIRE, then... BARRROOOOOOM!

      Dead silence in the Eye in the Sky. Slim stares deep
      into a monitor's dark pitch. Then...

                       (Leader's voice)

      Fat flips the power back on, and on the monitors...

      ... visions of destruction down below... smoke fills the
      vault as two SWAT members push through it... other SWAT
      members help evacuate the unconscious guards...

                              BENEDICT
                       (into intercom)
                What's the situation down there?

                              SWAT LEADER (V.O.)
                They blew it. They blew the...
                Oh, Jesus... If there was anyone
                in there, they're not in one piece
                anymore.

                       (to Walsh, soberly)
                Tell them to take the van. I'm
                going down there.

262   EXT. McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT                               262

      As the white van arrives at a charter airline's entrance,
      the five sedans converge upon it, TIRES SCREECHING, Goons
      emerging, weapons drawn.

                              HEAD GOON
                Get out of the van, now!   Now!

      No response within the van. The Head Goon signals and
      the others SHOOT the van's tires.

                                                               136.

      Slim investigates the Eye in the Sky's wiring.    Reaching
      deep into a mesh, he finds a foreign object:
      Livingston's "spider."


264   INT. VAULT CORRIDOR                                             264

      The vault elevator doors open and Terry Benedict makes
      his way into his smoke-filled vault corridor. He passes
      the Uzi Guards, awake now and stumbling to the elevator
      with SWAT members' assistance, then arrives before his
      decimated vault: Anything within -- people, money, Lyman
      Zerga's emeralds -- could only have been destroyed.


      OVER SWAT LEADER'S SHOULDER

      as he approaches Benedict.

                              SWAT LEADER
                Mr. Benedict...

                              BENEDICT
                Yes.

                              SWAT LEADER
                We couldn't find any survivors.
                Or, I'm afraid, any of your money.
                I'm sorry, sir.

                              BENEDICT
                       (doesn't want to hear
                        anymore; the SWAT
                        team failed him)
                Take your men out now.

      HOLD ON Benedict, seething, as the SWAT Leader steps
      away...

                              SWAT LEADER
                Okay, guys, grab your gear and
                clear out.

                              BENEDICT
                       (into walkie-talkie he
                        has with him)
                Walsh: How are we with the van?


265   EXT. McCARREN AIRPORT - NIGHT                                   265

      The stalemate with the van continues.    Still no movement
      from inside.

                                 HEAD GOON
                   Out of the van now! Hands up!

      An EMPLOYEE from the charter airline sticks his head out
      of his office door.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                          (innocently)
                   Hey, what's going on here?

      Half-a-dozen firearms turn and point in his direction.
      The Employee disappears back inside his office.

      The Head Goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for
      the driver's door, and yanks it open...

      Inside: There is no driver. Just a video camera mounted
      at eye-level. The Head Goon cranes back his head,
      befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe
      we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's
      rear bumper.

      The van suddenly lurches.


266   SHORT DISTANCE AWAY - CLOSE ON REMOTE CONTROL                   266

      complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van
      driver's POV) and a steering mechanism -- it's a near-
      replica of the one Virgil Malloy used in the monster
      truck drag race against his brother.

      And Virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to Reuben
      Tishkoff in one of Reuben's Rolls and watches the Goons
      scramble back from the flat-tired van.

                                 TISHKOFF
                   Enough monkey business.

      Virgil brings the van to a stop, then readies a
      distinctive red button on his remote.


267   BACK WITH VAN                                                   267

      As the Head Goon reaches for the rear door, his hand
      inches away when...

      ... BARROOOOM!    The door EXPLODES open!

      Knocked on his ass, the Head Goon watches as the canvas
      "X" bags within burn to cinders. He does, however,
      happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged
      from a bag: It's a promotional flier for a call girl
      service.

268   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT                                   268

      Benedict steps over the scattered remains of his vault.
      He picks up a fragment of a cash cart, burnt to a crisp,
      then lets it drop.

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                       (over walkie-talkie)

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                They took the van.

                                BENEDICT
                And?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                       (hesitantly, this is
                        bad news)
                And they blew up the bags, sir.

                         (dropping his walkie-

                                BENEDICT
                What, Walsh?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                They say it doesn't look like
                there was any money in the bags,
                sir.

                                BENEDICT
                What?!

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                They say the bags were filled with
                fliers. For hookers.

                              BENEDICT
                What do you mean there was no
                money in the bags?

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                That's what they said, sir. I
                don't understand it: we both saw
                them putting money inside those
                bags.

      Benedict stops cold. He stares up at a wall where an
      engraved sign reading "Bellagio" has been smoke-stained.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Walsh, cue up the tape of the
                   robbery.


269   INT. BELLAGIO SECURITY CENTER - EYE IN THE SKY               269

      Walsh stands before several monitors as Slim cues up the
      "masked men robbing the vault" image of a few minutes ago
      beside the present image of Benedict staring at the vault
      wall.

                                 BENEDICT (V.O.)
                   Does it say 'Bellagio' on the
                   south wall of the vault?

      In the masked-men image it does not, in fact, say
      "Bellagio" there.

                                 WALSH
                          (on walkie-talkie)
                   No, sir. It doesn't. I -- I
                   don't understand...

      Benedict exhales.

                                 BENEDICT
                   We had that installed on Tuesday.
                   The image we saw of the men
                   robbing us was a tape.

                                  WALSH (V.O.)
                   What?

                                 BENEDICT
                   Someone built a double of my
                   vault, then made a tape of them
                   robbing it. When we saw them
                   putting money in those bags, that
                   wasn't actually happening.


271   INT. SECURITY CENTER                                         271

      Walsh's jaw drops as he watches the tape again.

                                  WALSH
                   Then, sir...

272   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT                                    272

      Benedict is absolutely fucking furious.

                              WALSH (V.O.)
                ... what happened to all the
                money?


273   INT. BELLAGIO CASINO - CLOSE ON SWAT DUFFEL BAG - NIGHT        273

      carried through the Bellagio casino, held by the SWAT
      Leader leading his men out (now eight in all), and at
      last we PULL UP to see his face for the first time...

      It's Rusty, in full regalia, leading Livingston, Turk,
      Saul, Frank, Basher, Yen and Linus out of the casino,
      each dressed as a SWAT member, each carrying a duffel bag
      with nearly $20 million dollars inside.

      As we PASS each man, under the HUM OF the CASINO, we see:


274   FLASHBACK - INT. MIRADOR SUITE - LIVINGSTON                    274

      takes the call from Walsh in the Mirador suite as Basher,
      Saul, and Frank dress behind him.

                               LIVINGSTON
                9-1-1.   Emergency response.


275   TURK                                                           275

      dressed as a SWAT member, hustles down a cage corridor.


276   SAUL                                                           276

      has trouble rappelling with the rest.


277   BASHER                                                         277

      takes position next to Rusty at the elevator shaft's
      bottom. They're on-camera, but just a few feet away and
      (off-camera) Danny sits smiling.

                              RUSTY
                       (hiding his voice)
                Prepare to cut power!


278   YEN                                                            278

                              LINUS
                Guys, someone's here!


280   RUSTY                                                         280

      FIRES a SPURT of BLANKS.

      BARRROOOOM! No one is hurt. Nor is the money, stacked
      neatly in a corridor, ready to be packed into the phony
      SWAT team bags, body armor, etc.


281   EXT. BELLAGIO CASINO - NIGHT (PRESENT)                        281

      The SWAT team exits and boards the second vehicle Turk
      and Virgil have been working on all this time, the one in
      the warehouse with an air freshener hanging from its
      rearview mirror: it's a replica of a SWAT van.

      Turk takes the wheel as the others jump in the back.
      Rusty flips open another cell phone...

                               RUSTY
                Las Vegas P.D. This is Officer
                Brooks, New Jersey Probation
                Division. I have a violator in
                your jurisdiction...
                        (cupping phone)
                Hit it.

      Turk hits the gas and the VEHICLE PEELS away, carrying its
      cadre of new multi-millionaires far away from the
      Bellagio Hotel and Casino.


282   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT                                           282

      Benedict squats down to inspect a burnt scrap of paper on
      the vault floor. It's a flier for a strip joint.

                               BENEDICT
                       (and it finally occurs
                         to him)
                Ocean...


283   INT. CAGE/HALLWAY - MOVING WITH BENEDICT                      283

      Heated, he approaches the interrogation room, where his
      Plainclothes Goons keep watch.

                   Where's Ocean?

                                 PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1
                   Still inside, sir. With Bruiser.

      Benedict straightens his cuffs, cools himself, then:

                                 BENEDICT
                   Open that door.


284   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM                                            284

      Bruiser throws a mean left hook across Danny's face as
      the door swings open and Benedict steps in. Bruiser sees
      him and steps away, toweling off his bloodied knuckles.

      Benedict studies Danny: the man is a bloody mess, head
      rolling, eyes puffed up.

                                  BENEDICT
                   Wake him up.

      The Goons step in, slap Danny alert.       At last, Danny
      recognizes Benedict in the room.

                                 DANNY
                          (a little punchy)
                   Heya, Benedict... How's the other
                   fight going?

      Benedict keeps his cool.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Did you have a hand in this?
                          (beat)
                   Did you?

                                 DANNY
                   Did I have a hand in what?

      Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing?       He looks at
      Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no.

                                 BENEDICT
                   Get him out of here.

      As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches
      Bruiser's eye for just a moment. And barely winks.


285   INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE                                              285

      CLICK.   Tess does so.

      On her TV: A security-angle of the cage hallway.   The
      Goons appear, escorting bloodied Danny out.

      As Tess gasps, we go live to...

      Where Benedict follows the Goons and Danny out, brooding:
      what's his next step? Walsh approaches.

                                 DANNY
                   You get robbed or something,
                   Benedict? Geez, that's a shame.

      Benedict looks up, suspicious.

                                   BENEDICT
                   Stop there.

      The Goons stop, spin Danny around to face Benedict.

                                   BENEDICT
                   Where.   Is.   My. Money.

      They hold each other's eye.

                                 DANNY
                   What would you say if I told you
                   you could get your money back...
                          (beat)

                   ... but I didn't have anything to

                          (to his Goons)
                   Escort Mr. Ocean to the exit. And
                   contact the police. I would
                   imagine Mr. Ocean is in violation
                   of his parole.

       The Goons haul Danny out. Tess has left, heartbeats ago:
       the room's door is just closing.

                   Maybe we should have held him.

                                  BENEDICT
                   No.   Follow him. Everywhere.


290    INT. CASINO FLOOR - OUTSIDE CAGES                              290

       Benedict exits. Takes in his casino. It's been a bad
       night: he's down a hundred fifty million. He starts
       for...


291    INT. CASINO FLOOR - ELEVATOR BAY                               291

       As he arrives, the elevator doors open and Tess steps
       out. She breezes right past him.

                   Tess...

                   You of all people should know,

      million and one woman, boards the elevator. Its doors
      close on him.


292   EXT. ALLEY/VACANT WAREHOUSE - EARLY MORNING                     292

      The SWAT van rounds a corner and ducks inside the
      warehouse.

      Three-and-a-half seconds pass.

      And the eight SWAT members reappear, now all in suits,
      perfectly pressed, and with grins on their faces and
      change in their pockets, they begin their victory stroll,
      single-file and sloppy... right down the...


293   STRIP - MOVING WITH THEM                                        293

      Turk, Livingston, Frank, Basher, Yen, Saul, Linus and
      Rusty march down the strip single-file, and when they
      come to an intersection...

      ... Virgil and Reuben, also in suits, fall into stride
      for a victory lap in front of the Bellagio fountains.

      Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
      different hotels or grabbing cabs, until there are only
      two left: Rusty and Linus.

      They take each other in, shake hands, and part.

      Danny away. She runs toward it.

      They do. As Danny is handcuffed and prepared for loading
      in the back, he and Tess hold each other's glance.

      Rusty watches Danny being driven back to prison, too.

      SUPERIMPOSE:    THREE TO SIX MONTHS LATER.

      The great metal gate opens once more, revealing Danny
      Ocean in its frame again, ready for release.

      He looks forward -- no one's there to greet him, and the
      view of New Jersey looks no brighter than it did before.
      He takes his first step into free America...

      ... to discover Rusty leaning against the prison wall.
      Beyond him sits his second-hand Mercedes from L.A.

                                 RUSTY

                                 RUSTY
                   Hello to you, too.

      They shakes hands.    Rusty looks Danny over.

                                 RUSTY
                   Your hair's grayer.

                                 DANNY
                   Your eyes got closer together.
                          (beat)
                   How's life?

                                 RUSTY
                   Life... is a roomful of pillows.
                          (beat)
                   C'mon...

      MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together
      again.

                                 RUSTY
                   Where do you want to go first?

                                   DANNY
                   To a phone.

      Rusty had anticipated this.

                                 RUSTY
                   I stopped and picked up your
                   personal effects, put them in the
                   back seat.

                                   DANNY
                   My what?

      Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see Tess
      sitting in the back. She smiles at him.

                                 DANNY
                          (smiling back,
                           then)
                   I'm not sure these belong to me.

                                   TESS
                   Sure they do.

      Danny and Rusty get in.      Danny kisses Tess.   Rusty STARTS
      the CAR.

                                 DANNY
                   We need to find Rusty a girl.

                                 RUSTY
                   There's a women's prison just down
                   the road...

      He drives off. In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in
      his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.

                                 DANNY
                   You said you sold this.

                                 TESS
                   That's what I said.

                                 DANNY
                   Liar.

      As they drive away...

      ... another car STARTS its ENGINE begins to follow.   At
      the wheel: Benedict's goons.

1    A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN                                      1

     After a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the
     source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED
     TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches
     in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to:

1A   A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it    1A
     is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the
     truck is SHUT and we cut to:

1B   The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips    1B
     are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a
     wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest
     warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS--
     steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we
     were following disappear into a maze of synchronized
     activity.

1C   The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is             1C
     constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply
     raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards
     that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The
     striped tulips fetch a very high price.

1D   The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D
     sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end
     up on a truck heading for the airport.

1E   The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic
     flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold.

1F   The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an    1F
     airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane.

1G   The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a   1G
     truck. The truck drives through a small town and pulls into
     the back of a


2    EXT./INT. FLOWER SHOP -- DAY                                2

     A YOUNG MAN takes delivery of the flowers and carries them
     through the rear of the store to the display area up front.
     We stay on the tulips as we hear the following conversation:

                         CUSTOMER
               Wow. How do they do that?




                                                       (CONTINUED)

              It's an accident. It means the
              flower developed a virus early
              in the bulb stage. The flaws
              create the unusual coloring.

                        CUSTOMER
              Can you arrange something for me
              with those?

                        OWNER
              Of course. What kind of price range
              are you looking for?

    Now we SEE the customer: TESS.

                        TESS
              Well, it's for my parent's
              anniversary. They don't know I'm
              coming. I just want it to be
              beautiful. Can you just do whatever
              you think looks best?

                        OWNER
              I'll need a few minutes.

                        TESS
              Take your time, please. And thank
              you.

    The Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the
    flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest
    of the store.

    Tess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the
    curb.

                        OWNER
              That should be some surprise.

                        TESS
              Which?

                        OWNER
              For your parents.

                        TESS
              Oh. Yes. I hope so.

    One of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and
    crosses in front of the car. Tess starts moving away from the
    window.

              Which one is it?

              I'm sorry?

              Anniversary.

                        TESS
              Oh. Fortieth

                        OWNER
              Wow. Okay. I think I have an idea.
              Something classic.

    The Power Twin opens the rear passenger side door, revealing
    TERRY BENEDICT.

    Tess turns away from the window.

                        TESS
              Do you have a bathroom?

                        OWNER
              Straight back, on the left. It's
              unisex.

                           TESS
              Thank you.

    Tess scurries to the back.

                        OWNER
                  (to Tess, a caveat)
              It's unisex!

    Tess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door. She
    pushes through it and runs right into Power Twin No. 2.

    A nice place on the eastern seaboard. We hear the faint sound
    of a phone ring.

                                                                  4.

    Danny Ocean picks up the receiver, checks the caller ID. He
    smiles and answers:

                        DANNY
              Miguel Diaz speaking.

    Almost immediately, his expression clouds. He looks at his
    watch.

                        DANNY (cont'd)
              Tess, Tess. It's okay. You remember
              what we talked about, if this
              happened? All right. Call me in
              twenty-four hours on that number.

    He hangs up the phone and runs out of the house. He doesn't
    take anything with him.


5   EXT. HOUSE -- DAY                                             5

    Danny runs out of the house and down the street, leaving his
    car in the driveway.

              We had dinner with them three years
              ago. You talked about your parent's

    She says nothing.

                         BENEDICT
               Well, I hope Danny is as good as he
               thinks he is. A bouquet toss in
               prison can get pretty ugly.

     The landscape hurtles by. We pan over to find Danny sitting
     next to the window. We continue to pan and find REUBEN
     TISHKOFF seated next to a group of male commuters.

     REUBEN lies in a mud bath, his face covered with a dried
     exfoliating "mask" treatment. There is a cigar in one hand
     and a cellphone in the other. His eyes are closed to the sun.

               The wheelchair thing was an

               I told you, when her mouth hangs
               open like that, that means she's

     one eye. There, with the sun like an aura behind his head, is
     TERRY BENEDICT.

     Yen swims a strong, steady freestyle. Pull back to reveal
     that he is swimming in a 9' by 5' "Endless Pool" in his 15th
     floor Shanghai apartment.

     A HAND MOVES INTO FRAME and turns off the water current. Yen
     immediately slams into the end of his jacuzzi-sized pool. He
     lifts his head out of the water to SEE the POWER TWINS
     standing "poolside."

     He spits out a stream of invective, in Chinese. The Power
     Twins look at each other.

                         TURK
               Why do you do that? why do you have
               to get personal?

                         VIRGIL
               It's not personal, it's a fact.


14   INT. YOGA STUDIO -- DAY                                   14

     VIRGIL and TURK MALLOY, in GTX lycra yoga gear lead a class
     (mostly female) through the vinyassa. The studio is mirrored
     on three sides.

                         TURK
               It's personal. You don't argue
               logically. You attack.
                   (to the class)
               Bring the right foot back even with
               the left, buttocks raised high....
                   (to Virgil)
               ...you have to have reasons, to
               support your argument...
                   (to the class)
               ...flattening the back so the body
               forms a triangle.

                         VIRGIL
               I can't listen to you anymore. It
               makes me physically sick.

     Turk looks to him, but also sees a GUY in the class staring
     at all of the women "raising their buttocks high". He
     indicates this to Virgil, who goes over to the guy.

                         TURK
               Relax the crown of the head toward
               the floor. Draw the hips away from
               the hands, len--gthening the spine.
               And press the heels toward the floor.

14   CONTINUED:                                                14


     Virgil steps on the guy's back and leans down to whisper in
     his ear.

                            VIRGIL
                  This a serious class. No pigs
                  allowed. Okay?

                            GUY
                  Sorry.

                            TURK
                  Virge.

     Virgil stands up. Benedict and the Power Twins are standing
     right behind him. His expression changes as he sees them in
     the mirror.


15   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  15

     The Malloys and Yen are still waiting for the bathroom.

                            TURK
                  You're hallucinating.

                            VIRGIL
                  Yeah, whatever, OJ.

     Finally, the lock OPENS and RUSTY RYAN exits. We follow him
     to his seat, where he puts on a pair of headphones.


16   TIGHT SHOT                                                16

     Of molten metal bubbling in a small iron cask, a jeweler's
     cask. MOVE to REVEAL a GARAGE filled mostly with cars in some
     state of restoration

     FIND RUSTY as he painstakingly works on a new piece that is
     just BELOW FRAME. Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to
     him. He shakes his head; it's not right. It's just not good
     enough. Rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to
     the cask of molten metal. It reads: 736.18 degrees.

                            RUSTY
                  You are kidding me.

                                                                   9.



17   INT. RUSTY'S CAR -- DAY                                     17

     Rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city
     talking on his cell phone. He's keeping an eye on a white
     Cadillac that seem to be following him.

                         RUSTY
               736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix.
               I watched it.

                         FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               Rusty. What do you want from me?

     Rusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again.

                         RUSTY
               I want what I paid for.

                         FELIX
               And that's what I sent.

                         RUSTY
               No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And
               if my workshop were on top of Mount
               Everest it would be pure. But I'm
               at sea level, Felix, and at sea
               level it should liquefy at 736.95.
               If it's pure, that is. Which this
               isn't.

     Rusty makes another turn. A few seconds later, the Cadillac
     turns behind him.

                         FELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               Well, I didn't know you were going
               to liquefy it.

     Rusty pulls to a stop light. The Cadillac pulls up three cars
     behind him.

                         RUSTY
               Let me ask you something: When
               Christo calls his cotton supplier
               and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do
               you think his supplier sends him
               98% cotton and 2% polyester and
               when that doesn't work, says to
               Christo, "Well, you should have
               told me you were going to wrap the
               coast of Australia"?




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               10.
17   CONTINUED:                                                 17


                         FELIX
               Who's Christo?

     Rusty looks to the heavens.

                         RUSTY
               Felix, you're in a shame spiral.
               Have your assistant lose my number.

     Rusty snaps his phone shut.

                         RUSTY (cont'd)
               My god.

     Rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car
     to a stop. He gets out of his car and slams the door shut.
     He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window. It
     rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict.

                         RUSTY (contd)
               How long you gonna give us?


18   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  18

     Rusty continues to listen to his headset. We pan over to see
     FRANK CATTON seated opposite him.


19   INT. RITZ CARLTON HOTEL, NEW YORK -- DAY                  19

     The penthouse apartment. It takes the entire floor and has a
     360 degree view. Right now, all of the furniture inside of it
     is being taken away by movers. Frank enters frame.

                         BENEDICT
               Four weeks.

                         FRANK
               We stole that money fair and
               square. You bought people off to
               find me. You took advantage during
               an economic downturn, and made them
               say some shit they shouldn't have
               said. It's not fair, it's not just,
               and it aint' cool.

     A long beat. Benedict stares back at him.

                         FRANK (cont'd)
               Did you hear what I just said?

                I heard what you said, Frank. Did
                you hear what I said?

      Frank looks at Benedict and the Power Twins.


20.   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    20

      Frank takes us to Livingston.


21    INT. STAGE -- NIGHT                                         21

      Livingston performs a stand-up routine.

                          LIVINGSTON
                How many people here tonight were
                stupid enough to have children?

      A few people raise their hands.

                          LIVINGSTON (cont'd)
                Wow. No, seriously, that's great. I
                have a child. A daughter. She's
                five. They get to you, right? Am I
                right? Like emotionally. I mean,
                sometimes she'll turn to me with
                her little face and her little
                shiny eyes, and she'll say, "Daddy,
                please stop hitting me," and it
                just breaks my heart.'

      People aren't sure what to make of this.

                          LIVINGSTON (cont'd)
                I'm Livingston Dell. Thanks for
                listening. See you at ten.

      Livingston strides off stage as we see that he is at the
      Bellagio, in the lounge. Benedict and the Power Twins are
      waiting for him. Somehow he isn't surprised.

                          LIVINGSTON (cont'd)
                    (to Benedict)
                I appreciate you letting me finish
                my run. You've been very patient.

                          BENEDICT
                What can I say? You're a funny guy.

                                                               12.



22   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                  22

     Livingston takes us to Saul Bloom, reading the Racing Form.


23   INT. THE WASPIEST IMAGINABLE MEN'S CLUB -- DAY            23

     All dark wood and oriental rugs. MOVE across a row of oil
     paintings that flatter stodgy club members from the 1800s to
     the present. Land on Saul, sitting in window light that
     mimics the aforementioned portraits.

                         SAUL
               What it is about horses? I ask you.
               Is it the strength? The beauty? The
               fearlessness? The grace? Of course.
               But there's something else.
               Something in the eyes.

     The person with him nods.

                         SAUL (cont'd)
               Yes. When I look into a horse's
               eyes, I can tell: This one's a
               winner.

     A jacketed WAITER appears, holding a tray.

                         WAITER
               Excuse me, Mr. Bloom?

                         SAUL
               Yes?

                          WAITER
               There appears to be a problem with
               your card.

     The waiter tips the tray to reveal Saul's credit card, which
     has been CUT INTO TINY PIECES. Without missing a beat, he
     reaches for his wallet.

                         SAUL
               You take Visa?

                         WAITER
               I was acting on instructions from
               your business manager.

                         SAUL
               My business manager?

24   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    24

     Saul leads us to Basher.


25   INT. RECORDING STUDIO -- NIGHT                              25

     Basher is putting the finishing touches on a song. A producer
     and engineer sit behind a huge mixing console. It's good--
     Basher's really got something going here.


26   INT. RECORDING BOOTH -- MOMENTS LATER                       26

     Basher is leaning over a thick legal document, and Benedict
     is leaning over him. The music has been turned off.

                         BENEDICT
               Look at it this way...Eugene....if
               the album goes platinum it'll cover
               what you owe. And if the second one
               goes gold, that should cover the
               interest.


27   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                    27

     Basher takes us to Linus.


28   INT. CAR -- DAY                                             28

     Linus looking from the front seat to the back, talking to
     Benedict.

                         LINUS
               I'm responsible for myself. I have
               my own life and my own plans. I've
               never asked for anything but a fair
               shake. We make a deal, I stick to
               the deal.

     He turns forward, thinking. Then after a beat, he turns back
     to Benedict.




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I just need to be absolutely clear
               that we have an understanding: If
               you contact my father, I'll kill
               myself, and you'll never get the
               rest of your money.

     Benedict nods. Linus turns forward and exhales, relieved.


29   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN -- DAY                                     29

     Linus takes us back to Danny. The train hurtles onward.

                                                        CUT TO:


30   ABSOLUTE BEDLAM                                              30

     Reuben, Yen, the Malloys, Frank, Livingston, Saul, Basher,
     and Linus are all talking at once -- right at us. Right at
     Danny. And they are not happy.

     The group is in an abandoned WAREHOUSE somewhere near NYC.

     Danny is overwhelmed, like a deer caught in the headlights.
     He throws a desperate glance at Rusty, who's looking out the
     window serenely, letting Danny flounder.


31   MOMENTS LATER                                                31

     Total silence. Everyone just stares at Danny, waiting for an
     answer.

                         DANNY
               How many can't make the deadline?

     Everyone raises their hands except Reuben.

                         REUBEN
                   (off their looks)
               So I'm smarter than those schmucks
               on Wall Street. Whose fault is that?

     Fair enough.

                         DANNY
               How many think if they run, they'll
               be found?

     Everyone raises their hands. Including Reuben. Danny gets up,
     walks over to Rusty.

     The rest of the guys shrug and begin talking amongst
     themselves.

     After a long beat.

                         DANNY (cont'd)
               Well, the only other--

                         RUSTY
               We're on the five o'clock.

                            DANNY
               Good.

     A beat.

                            DANNY (cont'd)
               Where?

                            RUSTY
               Amsterdam.

     Danny steps back.

                         DANNY
               AMSTERDAM!?

     Danny's tone draws everyone's attention. Noticing this, Danny
     and Rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway.

     The guys go back to talking, mostly about what they were
     doing when they were found. This rises steadily in volume
     until the din is obliterated by a LOUD VOICE:

                         DANNY (cont'd)
               I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS A DEATH
               SENTENCE!

                         RUSTY
               FINE, THEN STAY HERE!

     The guys exchange glances. Danny walks over to them and
     sighs.

               flight.

                         LIVINGSTON

               mean...unless...is your first class
               section in the back of the plane?

     The agent looks back at him, confused.

                            KLM AGENT
               No.

                         FRANK
               See, you're not hearing me. What
               I'm trying to tell you is the
               reservations agent made a mistake
               when she issued the ticket, because
               on the rare occasions that I fly
               commercially, I always book a first-
               class ticket with no restrictions--

     The desk agent looks back at him skeptically.

                         KLM AGENT
               She may have, air, but this is the
               only ticket available to you on
               this flight. I need you to step
               aside so I can take care of the
               next customer.

                         FRANK
               Now, listen: Don't make me get
               black.

     Frank stands with his arm outstretched, shoes and belt off.
     Two TSA officers run metal detecting wands over every inch of
     his body. Three more guys pick through his luggage: they
     squeeze toothpaste from his Sensodyne tube, sniff his hair
     products, unroll his "tighty-whitey" briefs....

     PAN to REVEAL that Basher is getting the exact same
     treatment, right next to him. They exchange looks.

     REVERSE ANGLE: the rest of the group stands sipping iced
     lattes from Starbucks and watching the show. Reuben walks up.

               Take it. Take it. This is the
               least I can do. I've got a friend
               who owns the Bellagio of Amsterdam
               and I've made reservations for all
               of you there. It's all taken care
               of.

                         RUSTY
               That's very touching, Reuben.

                         REUBEN
               It's the least I could do. I love
               you guys. Enjoy.

     Yen sits in First Class, playing an in-seat video. Virgil and
     Turk kneel on either side, watching his progress.

                            VIRGIL
               Nice.

                         TURK
               Great anticipation.

                         FLIGHT ATTENDANT
               Gentlemen, you'll have to go back
               to your seats now.

     Reluctantly, they do. We follow them back to coach, where
     they pass Linus, talking to himself.

               How'd he get that seat?

                            TURK

     Turk moves on, taking us past a sleeping Saul and landing on
     Danny and Rusty, who watch a movie with fixed expressions. A
     reverse angle shows us that the video screen is twenty rows
     away--it is impossible to discern any detail at all. Rusty
     takes his headphones off and exhales. Danny notices this and
     does the same. After a beat:

                         RUSTY
               Call me an elitist asshole, call me
               a bourgeois clown, call me anything
               you want, but 'economy' is
               bullshit.

                         DANNY
               Oh, I don't know...it's not that ba-

     The guy in front of Danny moves his seat back suddenly and
     spills Danny's drink all over Danny's lap.

     Linus approaches Danny and Rusty.

                         LINUS
               Hey. You guys have a minute?

                         DANNY
               Sure, Linus.

                         RUSTY
               What's on your mind?

                         LINUS
               Well, I know this may not be the
               exact right time to bring this up,
               but I've been thinking
               about...well, about where I want to
               be in five years, career-wise, and
               I've decided I really want to be
               more than just a role-player. I
               really see myself as kind of an
               idea man, like you guys. I mean, I
               know you do your part and you're in
               the trenches with us and all, but
               it's really your show, and like I
               said, five years from now, I want
               to be running my own show....

     Danny and Rusty exchange a look...then look back at Linus.

                 DANNY                            RUSTY
     Uh-huh.                          Right.

               So if there's any opportunity for
               me to be involved in the, you know,
               planning stages of things, I would
               really appreciate it. I really feel
               like I'm ready for more
               responsibility and that I could
               really make a contribution.

     Rusty turns to Danny.

                         RUSTY

               We're negotiating the terms with

               taking the lead?

                         LINUS
               This isn't some gag?

                            RUSTY
               No gag.

                         LINUS
               Wow. Yeah. That would be awesome.

                         DANNY
               Okay, then.

                         LINUS
               Man. I wasn't sure if I should say
               anything. Now I'm glad I did.

               said no problem because I believed
               you were right that we shouldn't go
               deeper into debt and spend money we
               don't have. I mean, am I the only
               one who thinks this might actually
               be a good thing? That we could use
               a little humility? That maybe we
               were a little too pleased and
               impressed with ourselves after the
               Benedict job? Okay, I grant you
               that maybe this isn't what we
               deserve, but maybe it's what we
               need. We can do this. No, I take it

     Tess enters and buys a phone card.


40   EXT. PHONE BOOTH -- DAY                                      40

     Tess talks to Danny. Across the street, a BLACK SEDAN is
     parked.

                         TESS
               What are you doing in Amsterdam?

                         DANNY (PHONE V.O)
               Only what I have to do to get
               Benedict off our backs.

                         TESS
               Be careful, Danny. Please.

                         DANNY
               How's work?

                         TESS
               It's the same. I'm distracted.

                            DANNY
               I'm sorry.

                         TESS
               It's not your fault.

                         DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               I keep trying to figure out what I
               did wrong. How did he find us?

     Tess can't bring herself to tell Danny the truth, that it was
     entirely her fault.

                         TESS
               Danny, don't keep thinking about
               it.

                         DANNY (TELEPHONE V.O.)
               I did something wrong. He should
               never have found us.

               I'll call you tomorrow. I love you.

                         DANNY
               I love you.


41   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                          41

     Danny hangs up the phone and site.

     In other rooms, the guys get themselves settled in. Each
     takes a step toward personalizing their suite.


43   EXT. AMSTERDAM COFFEE HOUSE -- DAY                           43

     Danny and Rusty lead an obviously eager Linus towards a
     coffee house.

                         RUSTY
               She'll try and use her looks to
               distract you. Don't let her.

                         DANNY
               Be polite, but firm.

                           LINUS
               Right.

                         RUSTY
               Don't get soft on us. Don't make
               too many concessions.

                           LINUS
               I won't.

     Danny and Rusty nod. Okay.


44   INT. COFFEE HOUSE -- CLOSE ON EVELYN.                        44

     Who is obviously a MAN IN DRAG.

     Linus looks to Danny and Rusty but they give him nothing.




                                                       (CONTINUED)

                         EVELYN
               The onset of summer is like a woman
               who owns too many shoes.

     She/He looks to Linus, who looks to Danny and Rusty.

                         DANNY
                   (bailing Linus out)
               If animals were capable of
               flattery, the World Bank would be
               open until 8pm.

                         EVELYN
               When I was four years old, I saw my
               mother kill a spider with a tea cozy.

     Again, the Evelyn looks to Linus, who has nothing to say.

                         RUSTY
               A doctor who specializes in skin
               diseases will dream that he has
               fallen asleep in front of the
               television. Later he will wake up
               in front of the television but not
               remember his dream.

     Evelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty. He
     furrows his brow, then speaks:

                         LINUS
               O let the sun beat down upon my
               face, stars to fill my dreams. I
               am a traveler of both time and
               space, to be where I have been.

     Danny and Rusty stare at Linus like he's nuts, like he's just
     cracked. Evelyn's entire expression changes.

                         EVELYN
               Your young friend has a great deal
               to learn about respect.

     She/He puts his/her drink down and walks to another part of
     the establishment.

                         DANNY
               Linus...why don't you wait outside.

     Rusty and Danny follow Evelyn and quietly console him/her.

                                                                 26.



45   EXT. COFFEE HOUSE -- AFTERWARD -- DAY                       45

     Linus cools his heels.   Danny and Rusty emerge from inside.

                         DANNY
               Is that your idea of making a
               contribution?

                         RUSTY
               Her terms were scandalous. And we
               were lucky to get them after what
               you said.

                         DANNY
               The deal was this close to being
               blown.

                          LINUS
               "Deal?"   What "deal?"

     Danny and Rusty just look at him.

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I know what you guys are doing.

     Danny and Rusty exhange looks. What?

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               Look. That...person had too many
               cupcakes.

     They just keep staring at him.

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I was playing along.

                         RUSTY
               "Playing along!"

                         DANNY
               You called her mother a whore.

                         RUSTY
               A really cheap one.

                         LINUS
               Guys, I'm not falling for this.
               I'm not....

     But Danny and Rusty aren't laughing.    They look pissed.
     Seriously pissed.

     Danny and Rusty just look at him.      Linus squirms.

                         LINUS (cont'd)
               I called her mother a whore?


46   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                             46

     Danny and Rusty explain the job to the group.

                         RUSTY
               It's a privately owned home. But
               don't let that fool you. It's
               extremely well-protected.

     A photo of a four-story canal house is displayed on a flat
     screen connected to Livingston's computer.

                         SAUL
               What are we after?

                         DANNY
               A document. A very old, very
               valuable document.

     A photo labeled "The Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift" is
     displayed on screen.

                         VIRGIL
               What is it?

                         RUSTY
               A stock certificate.

                         DANNY
               The first one ever issued, from the
               first corporation on the planet.
               The Dutch East India Trading
               Company. It's the only one of it's
               kind and it's worth a boat-load.

                         TURK
               What's our cut?

                         RUSTY
               2.7 million after expenses.

     A beat. Turk seems confused...

     Danny and Rusty look at Linus,

                         LINUS
               Thanks.

                         LIVINGSTON
               What do we know so far?

                         DANNY
               There's a dummy key pad by the
               front door.
                   (points to a diagram)
               But the alarm is really controlled
               by the keypad in Mr.
               Vanderspeigle's second floor
               office. Now, here's good news: we
               already know the system's master
               code. Evelyn gave it to us.

                          FRANK
               That's not good news, that's really
               good news.

                         VIRGIL
               We just wait until he leaves.

                         DANNY
               Yeah, well...that's the bad news.

                         RUSTY
               He doesn't.

     Frank flinches. Doesn't like what he's hearing.

                         DANNY
               He's agoraphobic.

                Cracks his windows at
                night...that's about it.

      When Vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins
      fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than
      a few inches.

                          LIVINGSTON (V.O.)
                Can we tap into the system from the
                outside through the phone lines?

                          RUSTY (V.O.)
                Negative. It's a closed-loop
                system with two redundant servers
                locked into titanium cases in the
                guy's bedroom.

                It's hard-wired and shielded.

                We know his damn code, right?
                You're telling me with that much

               The street in front of the house is

     Danny looks to one side of the room...then the other.

                           DANNY
                Yeah.

     The rest of the room agrees. Matter closed.    Everyone just
     turns back to what they're doing.

                          DANNY (cont'd)
                Okay, so we know what we can't
                do...

     Frank stews.

                          DANNY (cont'd)
                Time to think outside the box,
                guys.

     A beat.   Everyone thinks.    Then:

                          LINUS
                Okay, here's something...I've got
                an idea...suppose we--

                           RUSTY
                No.

                          LINUS
                Well, but how--

                          RUSTY
                There's a Goldmann Grid over the
                enitre surface.

     Linus looks at him.

                          RUSTY (cont'd)
                Is that what you were thinking
                about?

     Linus nods.

                          DANNY
                    (sudden idea)
                But....

               --Well, that's different.
               Especially if we--

     Rusty makes a circular motion with his finger and then stops
     it with his other hand.

                         DANNY
               Right.

                         LINUS
               What?

                         RUSTY

               A Schuman Special.

               Livingston--

                         LIVINGSTON
               Absolutely. I mean, I'd need a day
               to--

                         RUSTY
               You'll have three. Basher?

                         VIRGIL.

               Sweden.

     Yen says something in Chinese.

               Clock's running.

     Everyone gets up and leaves. Within seconds, Linus is alone,
     standing in the middle of the room.

                         LINUS
               What's a Schuman Special?


51   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- THE PLANNING SESSION -- NIGHT            51

     Livingston uses a mock up of the alarm panel as a visual aid.

                         LIVINGSTON
                   (to Basher)
               Your shot has to hit directly above
               the keypad.


52   AMSTERDAM PLANNING MONTAGE (CONTINUOUS)                      52

     We see Basher rehearsing the shot. He can't get a clear shot
     of the target. In fact, he can't see it. He turns to Saul.

                         BASHER
               Let me see the specs.

     Saul pulls a well-worn copy of the alarm system blueprint.
     Basher goes to the height of the alarm keypad in the bedroom.
     It's 4' 10".

                         BASHER
               How tall is the surface of this
               roof?

                         SAUL
               About 87 feet.

                         BASHER
               How tall exactly?


53   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                      53

     Danny looks at a diagram of the safe they'll have to crack
     when they get inside Vanderspeigle's house, the safe that
     contains the "Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift". Everyone but
     Linus and Rusty are here.

     But then Rusty comes in.

               You're not going to believe this.

                         DANNY
               Try me.

                         RUSTY
               We don't have line-of-sight.

                         DANNY
               What?

                         RUSTY
               We tried everywhere. Some places
               we're only three or four inches
               off...but...there's no straight
               shot. Even with Basher. It's
               literally impossible.

     Linus enters, out of breath. Seeing everyone, he goes to
     Danny and Rusty.

                         LINUS
               Can I talk to you guys for a second?

     They nod and allow Linus to pull them into the corner. Linus
     looks over at the group and then turns to 'them.

                         LINUS
               Listen, I've done a little research
               on the Schuman Special, and uh...we
               don't have line of sight for the
               shot.

                         DANNY
               What?

                         RUSTY
               Jesus. This'll kill us.

                   (to Linus)
               Listen: Don't say anything. If
               you're ever going to run your own
               crew, you've got to remember to
               never show weakness.

                         RUSTY
               It's like blood in the water for

     Linus swallows.

     Rusty and Danny walk along the adjacent road.

                         DANNY
               The Swinging Priest?

                         RUSTY

               Crazy Larry.

                         RUSTY

               Robinov's Revenge?

               Given its location, my doctor

     Rusty stops walking. Danny continues, then notices he is

     As Danny and Rusty enter the hotel, Rusty trips on the steps.

                         DANNY
               Nice.

     Rusty bends down to look at the step. He notices that one
     tile on the edge of the stop has lost some mortar. He touches
     the tile and watches the lip rise up and down, up and down,
     as though it's cantilevered.

               They did it with the Leaning Tower
               of Pisa.

                          RUSTY
               Exactly.

                         SAUL
               It took three hundred guys two
               years to do that. You're crazy.
               Nobody's ever done anything like
               this.

                         RUSTY
               Not true. Palowski did it in `64
               in Venice and `73 in Istanbul.

               Really?

                         LIVINGSTON

                         RUSTY
               There are thirty pylons. We cut
               them, insert the jacks, and crank.

     It is pouring rain. From across the canal, we MOVE towards
     Vanderspeigle's house, favoring a barge moored just out
     front. Then, instead of moving over the barge, we PUSH
     THROUGH its hull to--


57   INT. BARGE HULL                                              57

     FIND Frank and Livingston inside manning a series of
     industrial water pumps. They're grimy and covered in sweat.
     Rain drips through the deck above them.

                         LIVINGSTON
               So, Basher approached me about
               being on a crew.

                            FRANK
               When?

                            LIVINGSTON
               Yesterday.

     Frank thinks about that.

     Yen pops his head out from a small tube and says something in
     Chinese.

     Frank shrugs...doesn't understand. Yen tries again.... This
     time he enunciates very clearly and talks very loudly (like
     Americans do when foreigners don't understand English).

     Frank nods, starts turning the handle of the water pump in
     the opposite direction. Yen climbs down out of the tube.
     Then he climbs back up the tube. He picks up a jack in the
     corner. Climbs back in the tube.


58   INT. UNDER VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                     58

     We FOLLOW him as he climbs through the tube and emerges
     underneath Vanderspeigle's house, inside its foundation.

     The thirty pylons extend from the base of the house into the
     into the swamp it sits atop of. There is little space
     between the swamp level and the house.   Runoff from the rain
     outside drips everywhere.

               This water was stagnant six hundred
               years ago.

     FIND the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater
     saw to cut a space in another pylon. Because the cutting is
     taking place underwater it is extremely quiet.

                         VIRGIL
               There's no reason for him not to.
               He would go to the cops.

                         TURK
               Okay, so he goes to the cops.

                         VIRGIL
               Then they arrest Dominique.

                         TURK.
               Right.

                         VIRGIL
               Then we have no story.

                         TURK
               Right.

               Mulroney.

     They turn to look at Linus, sawing nearby.

                         TURK
               What?

                         VIRGIL
               Why would she?

               To pay Franklin to keep quiet.

     Turk and Virgil think about that. Linus keeps sawing.

                         TURK
               That's good.


59   INT. APARTMENT ACROSS FROM VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT   59

     Basher and Saul sit in big cushiony chairs.

                          SAUL
               Counterfeiting? Me?
                   (beat)
               I have to tell you, it's not
               something I condone. It's cheating.

                         BASHER
               It is cheating.

                         SAUL
               There's no subtlety to it.

                         BASHER
               It's kind of embarrassing.

                         SAUL
               No one I know...

                         BASHER
               I can't imagine anything like that.

     A long beat. Then each of them reach into their jackets and
     produce $20 bills. They exchange and examine the bills
     closely by eye. Satisfied, they trade them again and return
     them to their coat pockets.

                          SAUL

               I told him about you.

                         SAUL
               I'm too old. That's dangerous. My
               stuff is cheap compared to that.
               It's just me and my gal, you know.
               What you're talking about is
               organized. But thanks, anyway.

     Basher sets up his gear again. This time, when he raises the
     crossbow to check his shot, HE CAN SEE THE KEYPAD. Just
     barely.

     He steadies himself. Saul knows that he's ready to take the
     shot. He speaks into a walkie talkie.

64   INT. EUROPOL HEADQUARTERS -- THE HAGUE -- DAY                   64

     A MALE SECRETARY (HESS) rushes through Europol's
     extraordinary Richard Meier-designed headquarters.


65   INT. AUDITORIUM -- DAY                                          65

     Europol Agent ISABEL LAHIRI gives a presentation to seventy-
     five of her colleagues. With her on stage are a couple of
     seated HIGHER-UP TYPES. She's nervous.

                         ISABEL
               Let's discuss, briefly and to
               begin, with the category of
               "thieves", as distinguished from
               the larger category of what might
               be termed "hardened" criminals.
               The highest level, "master
               thieves," if you will, is a very
               small world. Between six and ten
               high-level crews are operating in
               Europe at any given time.
               Worldwide, no more than twenty. The
               most famous, Gaspar LeMarc, is
               either dead or retired, and the
               expectation is that no one will
               replace him. The good news is the
               trend is toward their extinction.

     The secretary enters the auditorium and walks toward the
     podium.

                         ISABEL
               For example: Anecdotal evidence
               suggest these people are personally
               insufferable.

     The Higher-Ups look at each other; what did she just say?

                         ISABEL
               Their egos demand constant praise,
               and they embellish their exploits
               to anyone who will listen. They
               tell their own stories endlessly,
               provided of course, they are
               talking to a fellow thief or an
               intimate.

     Many in the audience are now looking to each other, wondering
     if this is appropriate.

                         ISABEL
               Those who interact with them on a
               personal level are relegated to
               positions of total servitude, with
               no chance for growth or freedom.
               Their lives are treated as
               secondary. Many of them suffer from
               depression. It's a crime for which
               there is no law, and yet causes
               untold damage.

     One of the Higher-Ups convinces the other to say something,
     but by now Hess the Male Secretary has reached Isabel and
     interrupts her by whispering into her ear. She balances.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
                   (amplified by the lectern
                    mic)

66   INT. EUROPOL HEADQUARTERS -- LONG SHOT -- DAY                66

     Isabel and Hess walk briskly through the ultra-modern
     hallway. He briefs her as they walk in a hushed voice. Then
     something he says stops her in her tracks.

     Hess continues to explain something we can't hear. Then he
     pulls out some PHOTOS. Isabel leafs through them.

67   EXT. VANDERSPEIGLE HOUSE -- CRIME SCENE -- DAY             67

     Isabel arrives and is greeted by PAUL, a lead detective
     working the Vanderspeigle theft for the Amsterdam police
     department.

                         PAUL
               Thanks for coming. We can really
               use your help on this one.

     His partner looks over at Isabel, who is wearing a skirt and
     pretty damn good shoes. The guy checks out her legs and looks
     away.

                         ISABEL
               I hope the scene hasn't been
               contaminated.

     Isabel walks away. Moments later, she enters the house with
     the lead detective.


68   INT. VANDERSPEIGLE HOUSE - DAY                             68

     As soon as she's inside she's all business.

                         ISABEL
               No forced entry.

                         PAUL
               Not that we can find.


69   UPSTAIRS -- VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOME OFFICE                    69

     Isabel looks around Vanderspeigle's home office.   Behind a
     fake bookcase is a small room which contains the safe. In
     the other direction is Vanderspeigle's bedroom.

                          PAUL
                   (nods)
               We can't figure out how they
               disabled the alarm. We thought
               maybe they tried to short it out
               somehow.

                         ISABEL
               No, that would have triggered the
               system.

     Isabel goes to the alarm pad. Pulls the face plate off,
     examines the inside.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               And damaged the circuits.

                         PAM
               Well, then I don't know how they
               got in.

                         ISABEL
               They had to have known the code.

     She moves on to look in the mark's BEDROOM.

                         PAUL
                   (calls to her)
               We considered that, but the mark
               swears that nobody in the world
               knew the code except him. He
               programmed the last seven steps of
               the system himself. He set it and
               never left the house again. When he
               dies, we'll probably have to
               physically cut all the power lines
               to the house to get it off line.

     Isabel examines the computer brain of the alarm system which
     was locked inside a titanium case in Vanderspeigle's bedroom
     closet. She answers the detective almost as an afterthought.

                         ISABEL
               There are other ways to get the
               code.
                   (to herself)
               Closed loop. Redundant servers.
               Titanium encasement. Not bad.

     The lead detective enters the bedroom.

                            PAUL
               Like what?

     Again, Isabel is inside her own mind. She's really just
     answering the detective's questions out of courtesy.

                         ISABEL
               Uh...well, they probably set up in
               a house across the canal and
               watched him type the code in
               through a pair of binoculars.

     We GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stands
     at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He
     twists around and looks out the window behind him.

                         PAUL
                   (calling to Isabel in the
                    bedroom)
               Actually, I don't know about that.

     Isabel re-enters the office.

                         PAUL (cont'd)
               Unless he had a habit of typing in
               the code like this--

     He stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type
     in the numbers. It's an obviously unnatural position. Then
     he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one
     normally would.

                         PAUL (cont'd)
               --then his body would block the
               view from across the canal.

                         ISABEL
               That's why they probably set up
               over there--

     She points out an adjacent window on another wall.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               --And used the mirror.

     She points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The
     detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the
     keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly
     across the canal into another house.

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen
               hundred millimeter lens to get a
               clear shot but--

     But Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her
     attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that
     is shinier than the paint that surrounds it.

     Isabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches
     the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is
     paint on it.

     Isabel cocks her head.

     A black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the
     wall above the alarm keypad.

     The lead detective watches Isabel intently.

                          PAUL
                What is it?

     Isabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from
     Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the
     paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't
     plaster at all. It's spackle.

                          PAUL (cont'd)
                What is that?

     Isabel cooks her head again.


72   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    72

     THUNK!   A crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel.


73   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           73

                          ISABEL
                It's where the crossbow bolt hit.

                          PAUL
                A crossbow bolt?

                          ISABEL
                Ever heard of Franz Schuman?

                          PAUL
                No.

     Isabel is at the window. The one that Vanderspeigle leaves
     cracked open every night. Isabel looks across the canal at
     the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards.

                         ISABEL
               They would have fired from that
               roof. Through this open window.

     Isabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure
     she's correct.

                          PAUL
               From that roof, through this
               window? Nobody could make a shot
               like that.

                         ISABEL
               Not a cop, anyway.

                         PAUL
               What's that supposed to mean?

                         ISABEL
               Sorry. Your friend downstairs put
               me in a bad mood.

                         PAUL
               He's an idiot. You shouldn't let
               him bother you.

                         ISABEL
               Yes. You're right.

     Isabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: "Eugene
     `Basher' Tarr." There are two names above Basher's in her
     little book: "Robert Ryan" and "Danny Ocean."

                         ISABEL (cont'd)
               But these man are exceptionally
               good. Even when they make mistakes.


74   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                      74

     A bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the
     wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a
     tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The
     wires run back to the window of the apartment across the
     canal.

     Inside that apartment: the wires end in another tiny wheel
     which is mounted on a large tripod for stability.

     In effect the group now has a mini-clothesline running
     between the alarm pad and the apartment across the canal.

     Livingston attaches a device designed to fit directly over
     the number pad of Vanderspeigle's keypad to the "clothesline"
     that runs across the canal.


75   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                               75

     Isabel writes: "Livingston Dell?" Underneath Basher's name in
     her notebook.


76   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                        76

     Livingston's device is shuttled across the canal, through
     Vanderspeigle's cracked window and right to the alarm panel.
     Magnets on the side of the device cause it to snap into place
     over the top of the keypad.   Livingston then types a six-
     digit code into a remote keypad. His keypunches are mimicked
     by the remote device. Vanderspeigle's alarm shuts off.

     Downstairs: From inside we see the front door lock picked.
     The door swings open.


77   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                               77

     Isabel nods her head. There's a slight smile on her face.
     The smile of admiration, respect in another's skills.

                            ISABEL
                  When did he get up and notice the
                  certificate was gone?

                            PAUL
                  The alarm woke him at 4:2O am.

                            ISABEL
                  But the alarm would have been--

     She stops.    And smiles to herself.

                            ISABEL (cont'd)
                  Oh... Oh, I know what happened.

                            PAUL
                  What?

     Isabel quickly glances around the room.       Her eye lands on the
     floor near the false bookcase.

     On some dark lines in the crevices where the floor boards
     meet.   She kneels down for a closer look.

                           ISABEL
                 There was someone else.

                           PAUL
                 Someone else.


78   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                     78

     Danny and Rusty come through the front door. They are
     followed by Linus. All of them are soaking wet from 24 hours
     in the swamp under the house, and the last few minutes in the
     pouring rain outside the front door. The group silently
     slips up the stairs.

                           ISABEL (V.O.)
                 Oh, I wish I could've have seen
                 that.


79   INT. VANDERSPEIGLE OFFICE - NIGHT                           79

     They enter Vanderspeigle's office. You can hear him snoring
     in the other room. Danny and Rusty quickly, carefully remove
     the crossbow bolt from the wall and take it to the window.
     They drop it (and the attached wires) to the Malloys, who are
     waiting on the street below.

     Meanwhile Linus spackles the hole in the wall and paints over
     the spackle.

     Danny and Rusty turn to see that Linus is finished. They
     hand-signal each other like Special Forces guys do, then move
     towards the bookcase on the adjacent wall.

                            ISABEL (V.O.)
                 That must have really been
                 something.

     Suddenly:

                            DANNY
                 Wait!   Wait! Shhhh!

     Everyone freezes. Danny puts his hand up to his ear to try
     to listen for the sound he thought he heard. We hear the
     faint sound of somebody singing to themselves.

     Danny and Rusty quickly realize it's coming from behind the
     bookcase. What the hell?


                                                       (CONTINUED)

     They yank open the false bookcase to reveal a handsome
     Frenchman who has just finished cleaning out the contents of
     Vanderspeigle's safe.

     Danny and Rusty stare at him.   He turns around and sees
     them, but if he's bothered in the slightest he sure isn't
     showing it. Danny approaches him. This exchange is whispered
     with a great amount of drama at very close range.

                         DINNER JACKET
               Can I help you?

                         DANNY
               Yeah. What the hell are you doing?

                         DINNER JACKET
               I am getting here first.

     Just then, Frank and Yen arrive.    The Frenchman looks them
     over.

                         RUSTY
               This is our score.

                         DINNER JACKET
               I am here before you.

                         FRANK
                   (joining)
               We let you in the house! Somehow
               you got in after we hit the code
               but before we got to the door.

                         DINNER JACKET
               That's thirty seconds. How could I
               know which exact thirty seconds I
               had? Unless I knew you plan. Could
               I have known your plan? Do you have
               a snitch in your group?

                           DANNY
               No.

                           RUSTY
               We don't.

                         DINNER JACKET
               Yes, I know you don't. Because I
               saw, the whole thing from that
               chair. I knew you were around,
               but I had my own plan.

     Yen says something in Chinese.

               There's really no need for that.

     Danny wants to raise his voice, but he can't.   Vanderspeigle
     is snoring twenty feet away.

                         DANNY
               Listen, we have to come to some
               arrangement.

                         LINUS
               We've incurred some very serious
               costs here.

     Danny and Rusty look at him.

                         LINUS
               Well, we have.

     The Malloys arrive.

                         DINNER JACKET
               Every second I am becoming more
               outnumbered.

                   (whispering, re: Dinner
                    Jacket)
               Who's this?

                         FRANK
               He said he got here first.

                         VIRGIL
               That's bullshit.

               This is our goddamned job!

     He sounds as angry as a guy who's whispering can sound.

                         LIVINGSTON
               If the situation were reversed--

               But the situation is not reversed.

                         DINNER JACKET
               So as much as I would--

     Basher and Saul arrive.

                         DANNY
               Just give us the stock certificate.
               Whatever else you took out of that
               safe...it's yours.

     Dinner Jacket stops.   Thinks for a moment.   Then:

                          DINNER JACKET
               No. But: I leave you with
               something.

     He hands Danny a business card.

                         DINNER JACKET
               My attorney. In case Evelyn's
               employer tries anything...well,
               anything.

     Dinner Jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out
     of his shirt pocket. He presses a button.

     And the alarm blares to life.

               Either way, he's got to have a name.

                         LIVINGSTON
               It can't be that hard to find out
               who this guy is. Like I said,
               somebody trained him. Who trains
               the best?

                         DANNY
               LeMarc.
                   (to Rusty)
               Right?

                         RUSTY
               If he's not dead.

                         LINUS
               Who's LeMarc?

     Stunned silence from the guys. They won't even respond.

     Yen says something.


82   EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- DAY                           82

     Isabel arrives.


83   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- DAY                           83

     Isabel is waiting to be processed. Eventually, she is
     directed down a hallway.


84   INT. INTERROGATION ANTEROOM -- DAY                        84

     We LOOK through a one-way mirror into the interrogation room
     where detectives Onderdonk and Devenpeck are trying the bad
     cop / bad cop routine on Evelyn.

     Isabel walks INTO FRAME and watches: Onderdonk slams his fist
     on the table. Davenpeck shouts in Evelyn's face. Evelyn
     just laughs.

     Isabel shakes her head.

     Frustrated and more exhausted than their detainee, the two
     detectives leave the interrogation room for the ante-room
     where Isabel is.

                         ONDERDONK
               Fucking stone.

                         DAVENPECK
               I'm not quitting.

                         ONDERDONK
               Who said quitting. I'm tired.

                         ISABEL
               Can I speak to him?

     The two detectives look at each other.

                         DAVENPECK
               Who are you?

     Isabel produces a signed document. They look at it, shrug,
     and give it back.

                         DAVENPECK
               Apparently, you can do whatever you
               want with him.

                         ONDERDONK
               Are you moving him?

                         ISABEL
               Oh no. I just need to speak with
               him. To get some information.

                         DAVENPECK
               We've been on him for six hours.

                         ONDERDONK
               With our best stuff.

                         DAVENPECK
               Our best stuff. In mind terms,
               we've been torturing this guy.

                         ISABEL
               I'm sure. I only need a moment,
               then I'll be out of your way.

     They shrug. Isabel goes into the room with Evelyn. We STAY
     WITH Onderdonk and Davenpeck, who watch her through the two-
     way mirror.

     THROUGH THE MIRROR: Isabel walks right up to Evelyn, smiles,
     and whispers one word to him/her.

     Evelyn's face freezes. He/she looks at Isabel, scared. Then
     he/she starts to weep. Uncontrollably.... Tears stream down
     his/her face.

     Isabel hands Evelyn a sheet of paper and he/she begins to
     write.

     Onderdonk and Davenpeck are dumbfounded.     Isabel turns
     around so she's facing them.


85   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- NIGHT                          85

     The entire group, minus Danny, sits around glumly watching
     CNN International on the flat screen.

     Danny is on his cell phone on the other side of the room.

                         DANNY (INTO PHONE)
               It's not a problem, it's a hiccup.
               It won't affect our schedule that
               much. I want to talk about you, not
               the job. How are you doing?

     KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. Something about it doesn't sound familiar.
     Danny moves into the big roam.

     Rusty is at the door, looking through the peep-hole. Rusty
     puts his head down. Clearly it isn't a stranger.

                         DANNY
               Tess, I've got to call you back.

     He hangs up. KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. Rusty indicates for Danny to
     get it.

                         DANNY
               Coming.

     Danny opens the door to reveal ISABEL. She looks at Danny.
     He looks back at her. They don't say a word. Danny motions
     for her to come in.

               Isabel.

     He crosses to her.    STAY with the group for a moment.

                           LINUS
               "Robert?"    Is that his real name?

     Virgil and Turk shrug.

86   ANGLE ON RUSTY AND ISABEL                                   86

     The entire group is watching them.

                         RUSTY
               It's great to see you.

                         ISABEL
               Is it? Because you've been seeing a
               lot of me lately.

     She hands a surveillance photo to Rusty.

                         ISABEL
               You were sitting in a Mercedes
               outside my apartment on Wednesday
               night.

     She hands Rusty another photo. (These are the photos Hess the
     male secretary showed her at Europol HQ that we couldn't
     see.)

                         ISABEL
               You were hiding in the bushes when
               I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria
               Bella.

     She hands him a third photo.   Looks at the fourth.

                         ISABEL
               This one...I'm not even sure where
               this one was taken, but I like it a
               lot. Very Ron Gallela.

     She hands this photo to Danny. It's a picture of Rusty, with
     a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox
     he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel.

                         ISABEL
               I mean, if I didn't know better I'd
               think you all came here to steal
               the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift,
               also known as the world's first
               stock certificate.
                   (to the group as a whole)
               You must have been so proud of
               yourselves. A Schuman Special. It's
               been awhile.
                   (smiles at Basher)
               That was a very handsome crossbow
               shot, Eugene.

     Basher winces at the sound of his real name. The group
     stares back at her. Can't believe this is happening.

                         ISABEL
               And the Palowski...whose idea was that?

     She knows it was Rusty.

                         RUSTY
               We didn't steal anything.

                         ISABEL
               Oh...I know you didn't. Somebody
               beat you to it. One man. No crew.
               No back up. Tell me something --
               just so I can get the full picture
               in my head -- was he wearing a
               tuxedo? A white dinner jacket?

               At least we saw him in the flesh.
               You'll never see this guy your
               whole life.

                         ISABEL
               So you know who he is?

                         DANNY
               Of course we know who he is.

                         ISABEL
               Well, then. I'll see you when you
               see him. To get your certificate
               back.

     She takes the photo of Rusty peeking from behind the mailbox
     from Danny's hand.

     She walks out. The group is frozen. Livingston is still
     looking at the pictures of Rusty following Isabel.

     another massive bet. Note: The same dealer pays him off.
     The same crowd is watching. But Toulour is dressed in a
     different tuxedo, and a different women is standing by his
     side.

                            ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

               The fifteen million dollar one the
               day the Berlin wall fell?

                         BASHER (V.O.)
               He was nineteen years old.

               Wait -- Prado Museum, the Picasso --
               that was Moretti.

     Toulour rockets his turbocharged Bentley into a tunnel.


94   EXT. MONTE CARLO TUNNEL - NIGHT                              94

     PICK HIM UP as he exits the tunnel in a new car, wearing a

                         BASHER (V.O.)
               He in Moretti. It's one of his

                         BASHER (V.O.)
               He left a Post-It note on the Mona
               Lisa that said "Bitch set me up."

                         LIVINGSTON (V.O.)
               Tell them about Saint Tropez.

                         BASHER (V.O.)

               If the King knows, he's not
               telling. He received it back a
               month later.


95   INTERCUT -- EXT. COTE D'AZURE -- NIGHT                    95

     Toulour. Another car. Another tux. Another beautiful
     woman. He pilots his convertible Maserati at high speed
     along the windy road.

                         ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
               How far is your house, Baron?

                         TOULOUR

               How'd he get all those aliases?

                         BASHER (V.O.)
               Until a month ago Interpol were
               convinced that the heists were the
               work of twelve different people.
               But not any more.

                         LIVINGSTON (V.O.)
               The French national police just
               gave him a nickname. "Le Renard
               Nuit" -- The Night Fox.

     Danny rolls his eyes.

                         BASHER
               Scotland Yard said he's the new
               LeMarc.

                         RUSTY
               Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc.

                                                                   66.

     A helicopter lands on a massive Lake Como estate.   Toulour

                         DANNY (V.O.)
               Personal information?

                         LINUS (V.O.)
               Some say he's one of these guys
               that thinks because he was born in
               a penthouse, he controls the
               elevator business. Others say he
               turned out okay when you consider
               how rich his parents were.

                         SAUL (V.O.)
               Taxes over here are brutal. People
               don't realize.

                         LINUS (V.O.)
               Father was a big-time
               industrialist, got into the
               cellphone market on the ground
               floor. Mother inherited. Had maids
               as a child. He's a public figure,
               people know who he is. He's been
               rumored to run for office in Spain,
               even though he doesn't appear to
               live there.


98   INTERCUT -- EXT. / INT. TOULOUR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT              98

     Toulour, in new clothes, with yet another woman, unlocks
     several locks and disarms two alarms. The woman can't
     believe all the security he has.

                         ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
               What do you have in there, the Mona
               Lisa?

                         TOULOUR
                   (as if)
               Please.

                         ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
                   (doesn't miss a beat)
               You know what? I don't like that
               painting either. I don't like
               anything Van Gogh did.

98    CONTINUED:                                                    98


      Toulour smiles and lets her in.

                          LINUS (V.O.)
                He's an avid golfer, pro-level
                tennis player, and inveterate
                gambler. But apparently his
                favorite pastime is....

      Linus trails off.


99    BACK TO THE HOTEL                                            99

                            DANNY

101   INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                        101

                          LINUS
                He's rarely alone. I think it's a
                compulsion. I have a list of names
                here...it was just the first week.

                          DANNY
                All right, moving on, is there
                anything else we need to know about
                this guy before we--

                          BASHER
                Did we forget to mention he's a
                Viscount?

                            DANNY
                A what?

                            LIVINGSTON
                Viscount.    As in nobility.

                Last time I checked titles like
                that went out with a little number
                I like to call the French
                Revolution--

                             BASHER
                Spain.

                             DANNY

                His title.     It's Spanish.   Mother's
                cousin.


102   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S BEDROOM -- DAWN                  102

      Toulour crawls out of bad. Wonders who the woman next to him
      is.


103   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY          103

                          DANNY
                He may be the greatest thief in
                Europe. He may have slept with
                half of the EU. He may be a
                Casanova with the soul of a
                starving artist. It doesn't matter.


104   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S HALLWAY -- DAWN                  104

      Toulour comes downstairs in his bathrobe.


105   BACK TO SCENE -- INT. AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN         105

                          DANNY
                There's something he cares about.
                There's something he can't live
                without.

106   INTERCUT -- INT. TOULOUR'S HOUSE -- DAWN                    106

      Toulour reaches the base of the stairs and stops dead in his
      tracks. He looks ahead of him to a wall covered with
      paintings. One painting is clearly missing.

      All that remains are the dust/fade marks on the wall to
      indicate that it had been there.

      He walks up to the wall and smiles -- certainly this will be
      an interesting day. He's actually been cheered up by this.

107   EXT. TOULOUR'S VILLA -- DAY                                 107

      Toulour in playing a hard-fought game of tennis. His
      opponent (EDMUND) bangs a great shot. Toulour gets there and
      smacks it back. Edmund dives for the ball, just gets it back
      over the net. But Toulour is waiting and hits a kill shot.

                          EDMUNDS
                Are you on steroids?

      Toulour laughs.

                           EDMUND
                Let's try again. Give me five games
                this time.

                          TOULOUR
                You are worse than Sampras. You
                should be paying me.

      A BUTLER arrives.

                    (in French)
                Pardon me, sir.

      He hands Toulour two business cards.   One says "Daniel
      Ocean," the other "Rusty Ryan."

                          BUTLER
                    (in French)
                Two gentlemen. They say they met

                    (in French)
                Put them on the veranda and get

                          TOULOUR
                Are you sure? Usually I'm so good
                at that.

      Edmund arrives, carrying his tennis bag.

                          TOULOUR
                This is Edmund. Edmund.      Rusty.
                Danny.

      He calls by their wrong names again.

                Nice to meet you. Edmund.
                    (making conversation)
                You a tennis pro?

      Rusty takes a sip of ice tea.

                Actually, no, I'm the King of

      Danny and Rusty nod, their smiles frozen.

                Sadly, I can't show you my favorite
                painting of all -- a Degas that
                used to hang right there -- because
                it was stolen recently.

                          DANNY
                That's awful.

                          RUSTY
                The criminal element is everywhere
                these days.

      Toulour nods.

                          DANNY
                Listen, Francois--

                          TOULOUR
                Please. Call me Baron.

                          DANNY
                We came here for the Vanderspeigle
                certificate--

                          TOULOUR
                That's not for sale.

                          DANNY
                Your Degas is worth three times
                that. You want your painting back,
                you're going to have to trade.

                          TOULOUR
                You actually expect me to believe
                that you are in possession of my
                Degas? You are living in a...in a
                bubble.

      Toulour looks at them and walks away.

      Rusty and Danny stand with the rest of the group.

                          BASHER
                He used the word "amateur"?

      Rusty and Danny nod reluctantly.

                          VIRGIL
                You said we could show him the
                painting right, to prove that we
                had it.

                            DANNY
                Yes.

                          RUSTY
                He still wouldn't trade.

      Yen says something.

                          FRANK
                We need to teach him a lesson.

                Absolutely.

                          DANNY
                All right, let's stay calm.
                We don't need to over-react here.
                He said some disrespectful things,
                that's true. But why antagonize
                this guy? Why get into something
                with him? He's young and he's
                filthy rich, and he's got time on
                his hands. We don't want to become
                his Betty noir. We can just fence
                his painting and earn a lot more
                than we would have from the
                certificate.

                          BASHER
                It's about reputation. You said so
                yourself. We have to get that
                certificate to Evelyn's buyer or--

                          DANNY
                We'll make enough selling the Degas
                to pay off her buyer--

                           FRANK
                Then why did you make that trip
                down there in the first place, if
                you didn't want to get into
                something?

                          DANNY
                Saul?

                          SAUL
                Turn his name over to Isabel. In
                exchange for getting off our backs.

      Tough one to swallow.

                          SAUL
                Short of that...the only
                appropriate response is to steal
                his next job right out from under
                him. Just like he did to us.

                          TURK
                We don't even know our next job.

                          DANNY
                We got ten million in that closet.

                          DANNY
                I cash in the Degas, take a moment
                to think about our next move.
                Toulour isn't going anywhere. You
                guys are hyping him too much,
                you're letting him get inside your
                head.

      Everyone agrees.

      Danny opens the closet.

      There's a picture frame in there, but NO PICTURE. It's been
      stolen by Toulour.

      We hear the SOUND OF A CASE BEING SHUT AND LOCKED.


111   INT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                                  111

      We see a SMALL, SECURE BOX being transported to a heavily
      secured truck.


112   EXT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                                  112

      The truck exits the building and drives down a street with
      security MOTORCYCLES surrounding it.


113   EXT. PARIS FREEWAY -- DAY                                   113

      The motorcade heads for the private airport.

      The secure box is loaded onto a plane as Isabel and her male
      secretary Hess exit a plane nearby.


114   INT. CAR -- DAY                                             114

                          ISABEL
                Why do I need to see all these
                guys? When I tracked the Munch
                down in Sweden I got all the
                approvals I needed with one phone
                call.

                 With Lenin's shaving kit the
                 Russians brought me in and it took
                 a single signature and I got it at
                 the airport a minute after I
                 arrived. What's so goddamned
                 special about the French?

      Hess gives her a look as though she should know better.

                          HESS
                Without their signatures, you can't
                do anything. You can't pull the
                suspects over, you can't do
                surveillance on them, you're not
                even allowed to contact them.
                They're real sticklers about
                sovereignty issues here.


115   INT. PARIS BUREAUCRAT'S OFFICE -- DAY                       115

      The Bureaucrat looks at Isabel. All of her.

                          INSPECTOR
                Isabel, I couldn't possibly sign
                those documents in good conscience
                without talking to you about the
                case in detail. I realize you're in
                a hurry and my schedule for the
                rest of the day is quite full, so
                perhaps, if you're interested in
                being expedient, we could discuss
                the case...over dinner.

                Foucquet's at eight-thirty.
                Apparently their's a private room.
                Better bring your kevlar.

                No.

      They walk on.

                          TOULOUR
                Very theatrical of you...asking to
                meet here. Like we're spies
                meeting to do an exchange.

                          DANNY
                Why are you doing this to us?

                          TOULOUR
                Doing what?

                          DANNY
                This is a game for you. For us it's
                survival. Are you that bored? I
                mean...

                          TOULOUR
                No. I wouldn't do that. No... The
                truth is...I made a bet. Or maybe a
                better word is a "wager".

                          DANNY
                What kind of wager?

      Danny and Toulour sit across from each other.   The bottom
      quarter of the Eifel tower is visible in the background.

                           TOULOUR
                A gentlemen's wager with a friend
                of mine -- my mentor. A few months
                ago we were at his winter place in
                Nicaragua and another guest
                referred to me as "the greatest
                thief in the world." I didn't
                object, obviously, but my mentor
                fell silent. Later I asked him
                about it. He said if I really
                wanted to say I was the best
                thief...I'd have to prove I was
                better than the eleven of you.

                 You know, the Benedict job made
                 waves, even all the way over here.
                 16.3 million dollars. That's a lot
                 of money.

                          DANNY
                163.

                          TOULOUR
                Sorry. 163. Before you were found.


119   INT. ARAB MUSEUM ROOFTOP FUNCTION ROOM -- DAY            119

                          TOULOUR
                Yes, 163 million is a lot of money.
                It attracts attention. So, in a
                way, you brought this problem with
                me on yourselves. You're victims
                of your own success.

                          DANNY
                Here's what I'm going to do. You
                tell me the name of your mentor.
                I'll call him up and I'll tell him
                that you're the greatest thief in
                the world...that I accept that to
                be true.... And in return...you
                leave us alone, let us go about our
                business. How about that?

                          TOULOUR
                He said you'd probably say
                something like that -- but he said
                you'd probably have your fingers
                crossed when you said it.

      Danny frowns, pulls his hand out of his pocket.

                          TOULOUR (CONT'D)
                So in this situation -- for the
                purposes of my wager -- words
                aren't good enough. I have to
                prove this on the ground.

                          DANNY
                This mentor of yours...was he a
                good thief in his day?

                          TOULOUR
                Who, LeMarc?

                Hell, this could go on forever.

                          DANNY
                No. It's going to be settled by one
                more job. A single object.

                          SAUL
                Whatever it is, let's just let him
                have it.

                Because of pride?

                One score, for the whole thing?

                          LIVINGSTON
                What do we have to do? I mean, is
                it a fair bet or is it like...the
                Coronation Egg or something?

      Danny points.   That's it.   That's the one.

                          SAUL
                He wants us to steal the Coronation
                Egg!

                That's just... that's...what is

                          RUSTY
                Carl Faberge, the greatest
                goldsmith in history, constructed
                the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the
                wedding of Czar Nicholas and
                Alexandra. Every world class thief
                in the last 108 years has tried to
                steal it. No one has even come
                close.

                          SAUL
                That's because it's cursed.

                           LINUS
                What?

                          SAUL
                It's un-stealable.

                          DANNY
                It's the only thing in LeMarc's
                entire career that he went after
                but failed to get. He tried three
                times.

      A long beat of silence....

121   EXT. ROME, ITALY PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY                     121

      The SMALL, SECURE BOX is being taken off a plane. Another
      motorcade forms and escorts the vehicle into the city.


122   EXT. STREETS OF ROME -- DAY                                 122

      The motorcade is completely stopped in traffic.

      In a nearby sedan, Isabel sits next to an Italian CARABINIERI
      LIAISON of same sort. Hess is in the front seat.

                            ISABEL
                  I'm going to need surveillance on
                  both hotels, phone taps, room bugs,
                  people in the lobby and by every
                  exit.

                            CARABINIERI OFFICER
                  Yes, absolutely.

                            ISABEL
                  If I had to guess I'd say I'll need
                  at least 25 people, a dozen
                  vehicles...and an on-call air unit.

                            CARABINIERI OFFICER
                  Yes, absolutely.

                            ISABEL
                  Okay, one more thing, and this is
                  crucial: these guys are extremely,
                  sophisticated at avoiding
                  electronic surveillance, so we'll
                  need real state of the art stuff.

                  I see...so...you've spoken with the
                  Pope and he's okay with
                  autographing my breasts?

      Hess turns around.

      The motorcade arrives at the Museum of Modern Art.

      We follow armored car and continue on to find Danny walking
      up the front steps.

      Angle on Livingston as he subtly nods at something in the
      distance. Danny is standing next to him.

                          DANNY
                What am I looking at?

                          LIVINGSTON
                A TR354 infra red motion detection
                system. It's the gold standard.

                No?

                          LIVINGSTON

      Frank and Yen look at an "authorized-entry only" door as a
      member of the museum staff goes through it. The door has a
      complex double-locking mechanism that would make it
      impossible to pick.

      Yen says something in Chinese.

                          FRANK
                What?

      Yen says something in Chinese, again.

                Well, I don't know, but that's one
                nasty lock.

      Danny approaches.

                Not since we first got here. About
                an hour ago.

      Isabel enters her room. Suddenly she spins and draws her
      pistol.   Her gun ends up in Rusty's face.

                          ISABEL
                Jesus, Robert. I could've killed
                you.

      He shrugs. A long beat as she takes a look at him.

                I'm older.

                          ISABEL
                I hope so. What are you doing in my

      Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.

                          ISABEL
                She hated you.

                          RUSTY
                Well, she was nice enough to hide
                it from me. Some people can't even
                do that.

                          ISABEL
                She hated everybody.

      Rusty nods.    He remembers.

                You'll never get it by the way.

                            RUSTY

                          ISABEL
                You'll think you've got it, you'll
                be so close that you'll be able to
                taste it and then this guy, the
                Night Fox or whoever he is, will
                just take it -- right out of your
                hand -- just like he did in
                Amsterdam. He's as good as LeMarc.

      A mock up of the room the egg will be displayed in. A dummy
      egg sits on a cradle in the center of the room. Infra-red
      motion detectors cover the room. Motion sensitive lasers
      shine directly onto the egg.

      Danny, Basher, Yen, Frank, and Livingston try to figure out
      how to get around the security systems.

                           LIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND)
                 No, that won't work either. The IR
                 will pick it up before you even get
                 close.

      This is depressing to everyone.

                 trouble, and we've got ten guys
                 Toulour must be pulling his hair

                Captain Giordano is handling an
                urgent interrogation. He'll be up
                as soon as it is completed. Please
                wait in here.

      He leads Isabel and Hess into the Captain's office.    A large
      clock on the wall reads 11:45 am.

      The open windows in the office look out onto one of Rome's
      famous courtyards. Captain Giordano stands with three other
      officers. They are having a loud, tense conversation in
      Italian.

      Isabel watches as Giordano's temper really flares.    He jabs
      his finger at one of the other cops.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED)
                Naples sucks! They're a joke! The
                only decent player they have is
                Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy.
                          ITALIAN COP 1 (SUBTITLED)
                Pasqualli runs circles around
                Bologna's backfield every time.
                          ITALIAN COP 2 (SUBTITLED)
                Pasqualli could single-handedly--
      Isabel turns to the officer who escorted her in.

                          ISABEL
                What are they talking about?

                It's an internal matter, Madame.

      Isabel and Hess look at each other.

      The Captain continues to argue. Those involved in the
      discussion are being brought lunch.


133   INT. CAPTAIN GIORDANO'S OFFICE -- DAY                       133

      Isabel's sitting on the couch now, her eye lids drooping.

      Hess checks his PDA.

      and a half hours.


134   INT. ROME WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                  134

      Livingston, Yen, Danny, and Rusty are experimenting with a
      way for Yen to drop from the ceiling so that he's hanging
      right over the egg.

      Their mock-up alarm rings.    A red light flashes.

                             LIVINGSTON
                Damn-it.

      Danny rubs his face. This is feeling impossible.      He goes
      into the corner and clicks a walkie-talkie.

      in the background we see Rusty trying to keep everybody's
      spirits high.

                          RUSTY
                All right, okay. Let's not be
                defeatists.... What about that
                mirror trick that Akimbo tried at
                the--

                          DANNY
                What's he doing now?

                          VIRGIL (RADIO V.O.)
                Nothing.   Just reading the papers
                at a cafe. Oh, no, wait. A woman
                just sat down next to him.... He's
                getting her phone number.

                Okay, take it easy over there.

      Saul and Linus enter.

                          DANNY
                What happened?

      Linus puts his BACKPACK down.

                          LINUS
                We thought someone was following
                us.

                          SAUL

      Isabel is asleep on the couch. It's 5:30 PM. A hand taps
      her shoulder. She wakes up and is shocked to see Captain
      Giordano, finally, standing above her.

                          SUBORDINATE OFFICER

      The Captain nods. Isabel looks over at Hess, who is still
      asleep.


136   MOMENTS LATER                                               136

      Isabel and the Captain are alone now. Giordano is looking
      right into her eyes, with laser focus. There isn't even a
      hint of lasciviousness about him. He's all business.

                          ISABEL
                ...reason to believe these men...
                    (lays out photos of Danny,
                     Rusty, and Toulour)
                ...are going to try to steal the
                Coronation Egg when it is actually
                put on display next week. I need
                official authorization to surveil
                and pursue these suspected
                criminals on Italian soil.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                Yes, absolutely.

                          ISABEL
                And I'll need substantial resources
                from your department. Can I count
                on that?

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                Yes, absolutely.

      Isabel stops.   Starts to wonder.

                          ISABEL
                So, Captain, what do you think of
                my skirt?

      He smiles and looks at her.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                I think it's very beautiful. Why,
                don't you like it?

      Danny and Toulour. A waiter brings them coffee, Danny SPOONS
      in a lot of sugar, then stirs.

                I don't usually call for a second
                date. For you I make an exception.

                          DANNY
                Thanks.

                          TOULOUR
                I think it's good that we talk. You
                see, you should stop following me.
                You're wasting your time. I'm going
                to let you go first and get caught.
                Then they will increase the
                security even more, and then I will
                steal the Egg. Then Lemarc can make
                his decision.

                          DANNY
                You sound confident.

                          TOULOUR
                Confident? This is a very American
                word. I am arrogant. There's a
                difference.

                          DANNY
                Doesn't matter if you're that good.
                Are you that good?

                          TOULOUR
                I can move objects with my mind.

      Danny just looks at him.

                          TOULOUR

                          TOULOUR
                Are you done stirring your sugar?

      Danny stops, lifts the spoon. It's completely BENT.

                          DANNY
                That's fantastic.
                    (starts to go)

                You're telekinetic, is that what
                you're telling me?

                Yes. But...it's a curse. A
                nightmare. Everything is too easy.
                But then LeMarc says I'm still not
                the best. So I take his challenge.
                And you will fail, and I will win,
                and so what? What does it prove?
                What is he trying to show me?

                Ms. Lahiri, you're in Italy now.
                We are a sovereign nation. We're
                not some adjunct, some
                administrative district of the EU.
                When Europol calls we don't jump up
                and tap dance for you. If you want
                to work in Italy, then you have to
                do it under Italian authority...and
                that means you have to talk to
                Commander Andriotti...who, I'm
                sure, will be happy to meet with

      An exasperated Isabel tries to regain her equilibrium with a

      TRANSITION TO:


141   ISABEL'S FLASHBACK                                        141

      Years ago. Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading
      the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles. She
      looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore.
      As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty. Eight cops are
      chasing him.
      Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel,
      they make eye contact. Then he's gone. Sprints around the
      corner. The cops rush past her. She hears sirens converging
      from all directions.

                Hi, this isn't official business.
                Actually, I'm here on vacation. But
                I was sitting in a cafe this
                afternoon, near the Piazza Navona
                and...the police were chasing
                someone on foot. I was just
                wondering if you caught him or...do
                you know anything about that case?

                Oh...

143   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVONA - DAY (STILL FLASHBACK)     143

      Isabel sits in the same seat the next day, reading the
      newspaper, enjoying her vacation. She looks up and stops
      cold.
      Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored
      suit, sits down three tables away from her.
      She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The
      audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in
      the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian.
      Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.   She gets up and
      walks over to Rusty's table.
                          ISABEL
                Excuse me...

                          ISABEL
                I'm quite sure it was you.
                          RUSTY
                Well, then I'm not gonna argue. Can
                I buy you a coffee?

                                                                 93.



144   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVOLA -- DAY                   144

      We transition back to the cafe. Isabel's phone rings.

                             ISABEL
                Hello.

                          RUSTY
                We've got to stop meeting like
                this.

      She turns. He's sitting at the table behind her.


145   EXT. CAFE JUST OFF PIAZZA NAVOLA -- DAY - LATER           145

      Isabel and Rusty are being quiet for the moment.

      The waiter's in the midst of an animated discussion in
      Italian with one of the customers.

                          ISABEL
                What are they talking about all the
                time?!

                           RUSTY
                Soccer.
                    (translating)
                He doesn't like Naples....thinks
                they're a bunch of...sissies.
                    (turns to Isabel)
                Can I ask you a question?
                    (off Isabel's nod)
                Will you come to Zanzibar with me
                on Friday?

                             ISABEL
                Stop it.


146   INT. ROME WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                146

      Danny sleeps, sitting up, in a chair as the rest of the group
      tries to figure out how to defeat the security systems around
      their mock-up egg.

      The group breaks into applause startling Danny awake.

                             LIVINGSTON
                We did it!     It works!

                What, what happened?


147   INT. ORNATE HALLWAY -- DAY                                 147

      TIGHT MEDIUM shot on uniformed National Police officer as he
      strides down the hallway. His bearing is disciplined, stern,
      formal. He is clearly handling a matter of utmost
      importance. Tilt down to reveal he is carrying a tiny cup of
      CAPPUCCINO.


148   INT. ORNATE OFFICE OUTER OFFICE -- DAY                     148

      The National Police Officer blows through, passing Hess.


149   INT. ORNATE OFFICE -- DAY                                  149

      Isabel sits with Commander Andriotti. The office door swings
      open and the National Police officer walks in. He places the
      cappuccino on Andriotti's desk and leaves.


150   INT. CAPTAIN GIORDANO'S OFFICE -- DAY                      150

      Giordano sits with his feet up on his desk, smoking a cigar.

      The door swings open and Isabel strides in, catching him
      completely off guard. She thrusts a piece of paper in his
      face.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                What's that?

                          ISABEL
                An order signed by Commander
                Andriotti instructing you to
                "provide any and all support that
                Agent Lahiri requests, whenever she
                requests it."

      He looks at it.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                It's good, yes. Okay.

      He looks at her.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                That's a very nice blouse you wear
                today.

                                                                   95.



151   INT. MUSEUM --DAY                                        151

      Linus and the Malloys walk through the museum.

                          LINUS
                When Dominique goes back with
                Thomas to check the trunk, the
                money shouldn't be in the
                briefcase. Franklin should have
                double-crossed them.

                          VIRGIL
                That could be a great moment, when
                he's on the ground.

                          TURK
                And you think Thomas is going to
                get blown up.

                            VIRGIL
                Hey.

      They look. A large group of Security people are talking to
      some NEW TECHNICIANS and ISABEL.

                          ISABEL
                Another camera here and here. And
                have a guard here at all times so
                any attempt to disable the system
                will be detected. All your IR
                devices need to be fitted with
                reflective faces otherwise a UV
                later can be used to burn the
                sensors out.


152   INT. ROME WAREHOUSE -- DAY                               152

      The guys look glum.

                          LINUS
                She just walked in there like
                Patton or something. She's
                changing...everything and-- There
                were so many cops with her. I've
                never seen so--

      Danny plats up his hand to stop him.

                          LINUS
                I don't understand. If her father
                was a thief...why's she such a
                hardass? I mean you'd think she'd
                have a little sympathy for us.

                           RUSTY
                When she was twelve her mother told
                her that her dad got arrested doing
                a job in Russia and died in jail.
                    (beat)
                So I wouldn't count on much
                sympathy.

                          BASHER
                "This time it's personal".

      Danny looks to Rusty, who nods.


153   EXT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAY                           153

      Fourteen police cars parked in front of it.

      Isabel stands at a police checkpoint on the road in front of
      the museum chatting with Captain Giordano, who's clearly
      brown-nosing her big-time since receiving Andriotti's order.

      Her phone rings. She looks at the number and answers it.

                          ISABEL
                What do you want?

                          RUSTY (V.O.)
                Ever heard of overkill?

                          ISABEL
                I don't even think Toulour can get
                it now.

                          RUSTY
                If he gets it, we'll let you arrest
                us. If we get it, you come away
                with me to Zanzibar--

                           ISABEL
                What is your obsession with
                Zanzibar?!

                          RUSTY
                Do you want to make the bet or not?

      starts balling.

      Danny and Rusty stand with Livingston.

                          LIVINGSTON
                I'm telling you, with everything
                she's done in the last twenty-four
                hours...unless you happen to be
                best friends with the head of
                security at the museum, unless you
                are someone he knows and trusts
                enough to leave alone in the
                gallery, after disabling about half
                of their security system, forget
                it. We are not stealing that
                egg...

                What about someone he doesn't know
                but trusts?

                          DANNY
                For instance?

                          RUSTY
                I'm talking about you know who, who
                looks an awful lot like you know
                who...

      Everyone looks at Danny.

157   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 157

      Tess walks down the street. She passes an alley, where a
      utilities truck is raising a MAN IN A BUCKET.

      She enters the department store.


158   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 158

      Tess shops for perfume.   The Power twins watch her from a
      discreet distance.

      She smiles at them.   Then makes her way to the ladies room.


159   INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY                                      159

      She walks in and goes right for the window. She's about to
      open it when it opens from outside. She jumps a mile until
      she sees that BRUISER is there, standing in the bucket from
      the utilities company.

                          BRUISER
                Hiya, Tess. Just climb on through.
                Try not to look down too much.

      Four stories above an alleyway. Tess climbs out the ladies
      room window into the cherry picker basket, with Bruiser's
      help.


161   EXT. STREET LEVEL -- A MINUTE LATER                          161

      Tess climbs into a taxi cab. Reuben -- in an anachronistic
      taxi driver's uniform -- is driving.

                          REUBEN
                There's make-up in the bag there.
                And some photos. Do the best you

                suite available. No, no, no. No
                trouble at all. We'd love... We're

      Tess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing
      sunglasses and carrying a puppy. Frank and Basher, as Nation
      of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her. Reuben
      trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes.

      A throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her. Strobes
      blind us. Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at
      her for autographs. It's a frigging madhouse.

      Tess enters and shuts the door behind her.  She takes a deep
      breath and exhales. She looks up at Danny, who's there
      waiting for her.

                          TESS
                I can't do this.

      Danny goes to her.    Kisses her.   Hugs her.    When he steps
      back he answers:

                Yes, you can.

      She motions at her body again; again it's totally ambiguous
      what part.

                And my ears. Anybody who sees my
                ears is going to know instantly.

                          DANNY
                Nobody's looking at your ears.

                          TESS
                Yes, Danny, they are.     They're
                going to know.


165   INT. DISPLAY ROOM FOR EGG -- MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAY   165

      Isabel stands with the MUSEUM DIRECTOR.

                          ISABEL
                When did that happen?

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                We just found out. I arranged a
                private showing for tomorrow
                morning before we open the show to
                the public.

                          ISABEL
                I don't understand, why do you have
                to disable any of the systems--

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                Because she might want to get close
                to the egg, got right up here and
                look at it. And I'm not going to
                embarrass myself or this
                institution by telling her she
                can't.

                          ISABEL
                She's an actress, Giovanni, not the
                Pope.

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR
                Do you realize how much free
                publicity we'll get for this
                museum, just because she because
                she decided to come by and look at
                the egg? She's even agreed to do a
                photo shoot for us promoting the
                museum.

      Isabel gives an exasperated sigh.


                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                  102.
165   CONTINUED:                                                   165


                          ISABEL
                That's exactly the sort of thing...


166   INTERCUT -- INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY                           166

      Saul, Frank, and Rusty sit on plush couches and watch
      Isabel's conversation with the museum director from six
      different angles. Clearly, Livingston has tapped into the
      museum's closed circuit system.

                          ISABEL (TELEVISION V.O.)
                ...that the people I'm after will
                exploit.
                    (thinks)
                Okay, fine. You want to shut down
                half the electronic system, let me
                post eight cops in the room...

      Saul, Frank, and Rusty clench teeth and fists... On pins and
      needles for a moment. If the museum director agrees they're
      in big trouble.

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)
                Are you crazy? That's worse
                than....you want me to treat her
                like a criminal?

      The guys relax back into the couches, their plan narrowly
      having escaped disaster.


167   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               167

      On Saul, Frank, and Rusty relaxing. Only this angle has a
      digital quality to it -- because we are watching them now
      through a hi-def TV screen.

      PULL BACK to REVEAL Toulour, sitting in a warehouse of his
      own, watching his own surveillance footage of both our guys'
      warehouse and the museum's closed circuit system.

                          MUSEUM DIRECTOR (TELEVISION V.O.)
                Look, if you need to do something
                to reinforce security during her
                visit, fine. But it's got to be
                out of sight. And it can't effect
                Julia in any way. Are we clear?

                                                                103.




168   INT. ROME BISTRO -- DAY                                   168

      Toulour eats with a beautiful woman.   Virgil sits six tables
      away, keeping an eye on him.

      Turk strolls in and sits with his brother.

                          TURK
                Where is he?

                          VIRGIL
                    (points at Toulour)
                There. I took a look at the
                interrogation scene.

                          TURK
                Why?

                          VIRGIL
                'Cause Linus said it was
                repetitive.

                          TURK
                It clarifies everything.

                          VIRGIL
                He said it's too on the nose.

                          TURK
                What's he, the head of the studio?
                What's he ever written?

                          VIRGIL
                He's just saying -- Oh, no--

                          TURK
                What?

                          VIRGIL
                It's not him!

      Turk spine to see "Toulour" get up at the other table. Only
      it's not Toulour. It's somebody who looks like Toulour from
      behind.

                          TURK
                What! How did you-- You moron!
                You said you were watching him the
                whole time!




                                                         (CONTINUED)

                                                               104.
168   CONT1NUED:                                                168


                          VIRGIL
                I was! I mean, I used the bathroom
                once, but it was quick. You lost
                him yesterday!

      They sit for a minute.

                          TURK
                Livingston said Frank said that
                Rusty said that Danny said Toulour
                said don't ever bother following
                him.


169   INT. RUSTY'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT                         169

      ON Rusty -- the blue light of an unseen television reflecting
      off his face. He walks onto the balcony.


170   WAVY TRANSITION TO FLASHBACK:                            170

      We follow Rusty down a hallway. He enters a dark apartment.
      Slips silently through the dining room. Two places are set.
      A candle on the table is burned down to almost nothing.

171   INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                    171

      The lights are out here too. But Isabel's still awake.
      Rusty enters the room. She doesn't look at him
                             RUSTY
                I'm sorry.
                          ISABEL
                What happened?
                          RUSTY
                I have to go. Right now. I have
                to leave the country. It could
                be a while. A month. Maybe more.
      Isabel turns to look at Rusty. She can barely see the
      outline of his face in the darkness.
                          ISABEL
                What are you saying? What the hell
                are you saying? Where are you
                going?

171   CONTINUED:                                              171


                          RUSTY
                I can't tell you.
      Isabel stares at his dark face.
                           ISABEL
                When people start talking the way
                you're talking there are only two
                possibilities: you're either in
                intelligence or you're a criminal.
                And no one I work with has ever
                worked with you...or even knows
                your name.
                          RUSTY
                You knew what I was the day you met
                me, Isabel.
                            ISABEL
                Robert...
                          RUSTY
                We can talk about it when I get
                back.
                           ISABEL
                No, Robert. I have to tell you
                something.
                          RUSTY
                What is it?
                           ISABEL
                I'm taking the job. I'm moving to
                Amsterdam.
      He doesn't respond for a moment.
                          RUSTY
                I can't have this conversation
                right now. Please, Isabel. I have
                to get out of here. I love you.
      He kisses her then leaves.

172   EXT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT                                 172

      Outside the front of the apartment, he shuts the door and
      turns toward us. We see his face in the light for the first
      time: His left eye is swollen shut. Blood is caked into his
      hair and on his cheek. Somebody beat the shit out of him.

                                                                  106.




173   BACK IN THE PRESENT DAY                                     173

      Rusty is still on the balcony.

      There's a knock at the door.   He opens it to see Isabel.

                          ISABEL
                You want to walk?


174   EXT. ROME -- NIGHT                                          174

      Rusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio.

                          ISABEL
                I know how you're planning to do
                it. I know Julia's visit is the
                key.

                          RUSTY
                Who's Julia?

                          ISABEL
                    (after a beat)
                LeMarc knew when to get out. He
                just quit...with his perfect record
                intact. Now he's a legend.
                    (exhorting)
                Don't do this.

                          RUSTY
                LeMarc quit because he was 75 years
                old, Isabel. He was tired. His
                doctor told him if he didn't start
                taking it easy he was going to have
                another heart attack. You're
                dramatizing it.

                          ISABEL
                You don't know why LeMarc retired,
                any better than I do. You have no
                idea.

                          RUSTY
                Actually, I do. I know exactly
                why.

                            ISABEL
                Really?    How's that?

                          RUSTY
                He told me.

                          ISABEL
                    (skeptical as hell)
                You know LeMarc?

                            RUSTY
                A little.

                          ISABEL
                Since when?

                          RUSTY
                Ten years ago.

                          ISABEL
                For how long?

                          RUSTY
                For six months.

                            ISABEL
                You--

      She's so mad she can hardly speak.

                          ISABEL
                You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc
                and never told me? That's the worst
                thing you've ever done to me.
                Nobody knows more about LeMarc than
                me. How could you do that?

                          RUSTY
                I couldn't tell you, then.

                          ISABEL
                Really awful.

      Isabel thinks.

                          ISABEL
                Then why aren't you as good as
                Toulour?

      Rusty shrugs.

      A beat.

                I don't want to arrest you, Robert.
                I really don't. But I will if you
                make me. I will if you go for that
                egg.

      Rusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city.

                          ISABEL
                So many times, I waited. You can't
                do that to a person.

                           RUSTY
                Isabel--

                          ISABEL
                I have to go.

      Isabel gets up...walks away fast.    She's barely holding
      herself together.

      Rusty watches her go.   Several seconds, then:


175   FLASHBACK -- INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- ROME -- DAY         175

      Rusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the
      front door of his apartment with Isabel. It's a perfect
      sunny day outside.
      He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the
      apartment is bare. The furniture is still there. But
      nothing else. Nothing on the walls or the shelves.    Isabel
      has clearly moved out.
      Rusty's whole body reacts.... He slowly looks around him, as
      if in a dream. His eye goes to the dining room table.
      Isabel's engagement ring is there.

176   BACK TO SCENE -- EXT. ROME -- CAMPIDOGLIO -- NIGHT          176

      Rusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance.
      She turns the corner out of sight.


177   EXT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                           177

      Isabel pulls up in her car.

                                                                 109.

      The Egg is being put into position. Isabel watches.


179   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN                                   179

      Reuben is talking to Yen. Frank and Livingston get ready in
      the background.

                          REUBEN
                You're a photographer. Very
                exacting. You want things a certain
                way, but you never raise your
                voice. You're uncompromising.
                Strong.

                          FRANK
                Reuben, what are you doing?

                          REUBEN
                Oh, we understand each other. I'm
                mean, the actual words are
                gibberish to me, but I know what he
                means. There's a tone, you know. We
                communicate. I'm sure he'd tell you
                the same thing.
                    (to Yen)
                Am I right?

      Yen says something in Chinese.

      Danny and the Malloys are looking at Tess's hair.

                          TURK
                I say we do a Joey Heatherton,
                1971.

                It's the wrong color.

      Turk looks at his watch.

                          TURK
                Damn.

      There's a knock at the door. They let Tess check on it. She
      looks out the keyhole;

      It's TOPHER GRACE.

      Tess looks back to the group and shrugs.

                            TOPHER
                    (off)
                Hello?

      He knocks again.

      The group scrambles and hides. Tess opens the door.

                          TOPHER
                Hey! I got your room number from
                McCormick, I hope you don't mind.

      He walks in and hugs her. She looks terrified. Topher
      disengages and looks around.

                          TOPHER
                This is great. Do you have the
                adjoining room?

                            TESS
                Uh, no.

                          TOPHER
                Oh. Hey. I saw the rough cut of YOU
                ALWAYS, YOU NEVER. It's so awesome.
                Congratulations.

                          TESS
                Oh. Thank you.

                          TOPHER
                It was just like a dub of a lo-rez
                output, but I could totally see
                what you were doing. I think you
                might win again. Seriously.

                            TESS
                Oh.

                          TOPHER
                It really actually looked like you
                were blind. How did you do that?
                What is it like, an on-set thing,
                or was it digital?

                          TESS

                You can tell me, I won't tell a
                soul. Because if you say it's
                instinctual, I'm quitting right
                now. Seriously. The way you parted
                your hair? That was so connected.
                And that scene with the matches?
                And when you find out who your real
                grandmother is and run through the
                rain and find her on the porch and
                touch her face? Man, that was...you
                gotta tell Steven how much I loved
                it.

                            TESS
                Okay.

                          TOPHER

                    (laughs)
                I mean next. What movie are you

                          TESS
                I...I'm having trouble deciding
                what to do next.

                          TOPHER
                Is Danny working?

181   INT. MUSEUM -- ENTRY HALL -- DAY                         181

      Reuben (dressed in a hip-hop outfit) and Linus (dressed like
      an agent) stand in front of some paparazzi. A crowd of
      museum employees also rubberneck.

                responsible for Ms. Roberts
                itinerary, has graciously set aside
                time for Ms. Roberts to view the
                Coronation Egg privately.

      Isabel, the Security Director, and Captain Giordano sit with
      four cops watching a bank of closed circuit screens.

                          ISABEL
                I want to be on record as saying
                that you should have shut the
                entire museum down.

      Isabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through
      the other wings of the museum.


183   INT. MUSEUM -- ENTRY HALL -- DAY                              183

      "Julia" arrives flanked by her "Nation of Islam" guards,
      Frank and Basher. The assembled employees clap and call her
      name. She waves as they take her picture.

      Topher throws his arm around Julia to make sure he gets in
      all the shots. The Museum Director comes up to greet
      "Julia".

      Isabel points at a screen showing the museum's other
      entrance. Rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum.

                No. No. Get as close as you like.

      Rusty ponders a painting like college student trying to
      impress his art history professor. Finally he moves on, into
      another gallery.

      PAN to REVEAL nine uniformed cops trailing behind him.

      Yen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker.

      He whispers Chinese into a bullhorn.

      Theoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and
      Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up
      the camera, lights, and flags.

      Each "crew member" carries an odd-looking oversized "light
      meter". Upon closer examination we can see that each device
      has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the
      museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully
      placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the
      egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the
      gallery.

      "Studio Execs," Reuben and Linus go to "Julia."

                I completely agree!

                sort of stunt.

      Yen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of "Julia" and
      Topher. "Julia" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting
      her hands up to block her ears.

      Topher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around
      flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese
      language orders.

                Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you
                so much.

                you've been going through I can see
                how you'd need something.

                          TESS
                They're just aspirin.

                          TOPHER
                Right. I've never taken aspirin in
                my life, ever. Can you believe
                that?

                          TESS
                That's amazing.

                          TOPHER
                For me, it's like a control thing.

                          TESS
                Well, with aspirin...it's very
                beneficial.

                          TOPHER
                Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

      They are interrupted by the sound of PIERCING SIRENS and
      CLANGING BELLS -- all manner of alarms coming from the
      gallery containing the egg.

      Tess rushes back to the gallery just in time to see police
      officers pin Danny and his entire crew on the floor and
      against walls and start handcuffing them. She freezes.
      Can't move.... Her bodyguards (Frank and Basher ) grab her
      and move her quickly out of the area.


191   EXT. ROME POLICE HEADQUARTERS -- DAY                        191

      Three massive Ford Excursion SUV's with diplomatic plates
      double park out front, completely blocking the flow of
      traffic on the narrow street.

      Eight FBI agents climb out of their behemoths and walk inside
      like they own the place. The boss is a 55 year-old agent
      named MOLLY STARR.


192   INT. LOBBY -- DAY                                           192

      Molly Starr steps inside with her posse.   She pulls out her
      badge and hangs it around her neck.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Who's in charge?

      Isabel and Captain Giordano look at her and her team with
      obvious trepidation.

                          ISABEL
                    (tentative)
                I am.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                    (smelling trouble)
                She is.

      Molly gives a slight nod to one of her lackeys.   He thrusts
      an official-looking paper at Isabel.


193   INT. "OBSERVATION "HALLWAY -- DAY                           193

      Molly swaggers down a hallway, followed by Isabel and
      Giordano. She stops at an observation window and looks
      through it to see Danny, who is handcuffed to a chair,
      awaiting interrogation. His expression is impassive.

      She moves on to the next window: Yen. Same impassive
      expression. She continues down the line, Reuben, Livingston,
      and Saul. Each has the same impassive expression. Through
      the final window she sees Linus...


                                                         (CONTINUED)

      He's nervously tapping his foot.   Molly smiles sadistically.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Oh, yeah... I'll start with him.


194   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY                            194

      Molly sits face-to-face with Linus. Isabel and Captain
      Giordano stand in the corner and observe.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                When people think of Italy they
                think of food, wine, the
                Renaissance. They don't realize
                Italy has the scariest prisons in
                the civilized world. You know why?
                They're all leftover from the
                Middle Ages. They're worse than
                dirty; they're damp. They're like
                caves.

      Linus can't look her in the eye.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR (cont'd)
                I'm the only hope you've got.

                          LINUS
                What do you want?

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Testify against the others in the
                Benedict case.

                          LINUS
                I can't do that.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Sure you can. You'll get a year,
                maybe two. The Italian charges
                will be dropped. You and the
                others will be extradited to the US
                this afternoon.

      A long beat.

                          AGENT MOLLY STARR
                Think about those prisons. Think
                about living there for twenty
                years, getting out when you're
                fifty. What a catch you'll be.

                                                                 119.




195   EXT. / INT. FBI SUV -- DAY                                 195

      Linus is bundled into the back of the SUV. Agent Starr gets
      in next to him. She motions to the driver. They pull out.


196   EXT. POLICE STATION -- DAY                                 196

      Agent Starr's SUV is followed by three other SUV's and
      escorted by two Rome Police cars.


197   INT. FBI SUV -- DAY                                        197

      Linus stares morosely at the headrest in front of him.

      A long, long beat...then he turns to Agent Starr:

                          LINUS
                Did you tell Dad?

      Before "Agent Starr" answers the agent in the passenger seat
      turns around.

      It's Clint Eastwood.

                          CLINT
                Of course she did.   We're married,
                for God's sake.


198   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                    198

      Tess waits. A key sounds in the door, and she is on her feet.
      She reaches Danny before he's all the way in the room. She
      kisses him, then remembers she's mad at him.

                          TESS
                Why didn't you tell me?

                          DANNY
                I couldn't.

                             TESS
                Why not?

                          DANNY
                Because you're not an actress. You
                wouldn't have been so real.

                          TESS
                I thought you were going to jail.

                          DANNY
                I'm not going to jail.

      A beat.

                          TESS
                So you don't think I'm a good
                actress.

                          DANNY
                You're a terrible liar.

                          TESS
                I'm a good liar.

                          DANNY
                Where did Benedict find you?

                           TESS
                He...

                          DANNY
                At your parent's house.

                          TESS
                That was...okay, so I'm not a good
                liar. So what. You're good enough
                for both of us.

                           DANNY
                Exactly.


199   EXT. CIAMPINO AIRPORT -- DAY                             199

      The motorcade of FBI SUV's pulls through the security gate
      and drives toward a US government Gulfstream parked on the
      flight line.

      Isabel watches with Captain Giordino and Commander Andriotti.

      Linus, Saul, Yen, Livingston and Reuben get out of the SUVs,
      all of them beaming. They hug Linus's mom and dad and mount
      the steps to the plane. Then Rusty gets out, says goodbye to
      everyone, and heads for Isabel.

                          ISABEL
                    (eyes go wide)

                 plane take off!

      Giordano stares blankly at her.   But he doesn't move.

                          ISABEL (cont'd)
                Do something! Do you realize
                what's happening?! Do you
                understand what's going on?!

                    (deadpan)
                Yes, absolutely.

      Isabel blinks.   It takes a second to hit her. Rusty
      approaches.

                          RUSTY
                Guys. Get on there before they
                leave without you. Thanks.

                          CAPTAIN GIORDANO
                    (speaking like an
                     American)
                Hey, no problem. Good seeing you,
                man.

                          ANDRIOTTI
                Take care. See you back home.

                          RUSTY
                Thanks, Scooter.

      Isabel is dumbstruck.


200   EXT. TOULOUR'S VILLA -- DAY                                200

      Toulour pulls up in a Ferrari.    His butler gets the door for
      him.

                          BUTLER
                How was Rome, air?

      Toulour answers by handing a small velvet bag to his butler
      (a bag just big enough to hold the coronation egg).

                Put this in the safe, would you?

      Isabel watches as the "US Government" Gulfstream containing
      all the members of Rusty's crew that she arrested at the
      museum taxis down the runway and becomes airborne. She turns
      to Rusty.

                          ISABEL
                I hate you.

                          RUSTY

                          ISABEL
                This will ruin me.

                          RUSTY
                No, it won't. Not if you come to
                Zanzibar.

                          ISABEL
                What is it with Zanzibar?

                          RUSTY
                It's where LeMarc is.

      Rusty points nearby at another private plane.    The pilot has
      just opened the door and put the stairs down.

                          RUSTY
                That one's ours.     We can be there
                in three hours.

      A beat.

202   EXT. VERANDA -- DAY                                      202

      Toulour walks out to find Danny and Tess chomping on gourmet
      nuts and sipping his special reserve brandy.

                Let me guess, you decided you did
                want to give my lawyer a call. But
                you lost his card.

      Toulour holds out another card to Danny.

                          DANNY
                No, nothing like that. We just
                came to collect our money.

                          TOULOUR
                Not only did you fail, half of your
                crew got pinched! Your plan was
                not good.

      Toulour stops. Danny and Tess just look at him. Something
      about their demeanor is troubling. Namely, that they look
      completely untroubled.

                          TOULOUR
                Oh, no. You stole it on the way to
                Rome didn't you? I stole a replica.


203   EXT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                               203

      A repeat of the shot of the SMALL, SECURE BOX being taken to
      a truck.

      The truck moves out of the garage and on to the street as
      before. This time the shot continues over to a door on the
      side of the building. A YOUNG KID emerges with a backpack
      over his shoulder.


204   EXT. PARIS STREET -- DAY                                 204

      The BACKPACK KID passes another guy, a NORMAL-LOOKING GUY,
      who, after a beat, follows Backpack Kid.


205   INT. PARIS TRAIN STATION -- DAY                          205

      The Backpack Kid, followed by Normal-Looking Guy, walk
      through the terminal and get in line. We swing over to see
      Normal Looking Guy #2 looking at them.


206   INT. TRAIN -- DAY                                        206

      In motion. We start on the Backpack Kid, who is reading a
      book. The Backpack is beneath his legs. Next to him sits
      LINUS. Across from him is one of the Normal-Looking Guys. The
      other Normal-Looking Guy is a row away, facing him.

      Linus looks at the door of the car.

      SAUL

      Is making his way through the door. He looks drunk.

      LINUS

      Looks down at his copy of the French FHM.

      SAUL



                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                                125.
206   CONTINUED:                                                 206

      Gets close and closer to Linus and the Backpack Kid.

      LINUS

      Puts his magazine away.

      SAUL

      Is almost to Linus's row, he stumbles a little, almost falls.

      Then, with a loud WHOOSH the train goes completely dark. It's
      gone into a tunnel. We hear Saul's voice CRY OUT.

      In a few seconds, the train exits the tunnel and the lights
      come back on.

      SAUL

      Has fallen into the lap of the BackPack kid. Linus and the
      Normal-Looking Guy try to help him up.

      He stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat.

                          LINUS
                    (in French)
                He's completely drunk.
      The BackPack Kid nods his head. Linus goes back to his book.
      We drop down to see HIS BACKPACK also beneath his feet.


207   INT. TRAIN STATION ROME, ITALY -- DAY                     207

      Linus walks through the terminal, backpack over his shoulder.
      Suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace.

      Saul, seeing this and reacting, splits off into another
      direction.


208   INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                     208

      Linus and Saul approach the group.

                          DANNY
                What happened?

      Linus puts his BACKPACK down.

                          LINUS
                We thought someone was following
                us.

                                                               126.




209   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         209

                          TOULOUR
                But that means you knew what to
                steal before LeMarc proposed that I
                challenge you for it. That means...


210   INT. RUSTY'S GARAGE -- DAY                               210

      The image from the beginning of the film, with Rusty watching
      the boiling cask. He's talking on the phone.

                          RUSTY
                Gaspar, it's Rusty. How are you?

      And this time we see what be is working on:

      A PERFECT REPLICA OF THE CORONATION EGG.

      In the warehouse in NYC, we see Danny and Rusty "arguing",
      but from a different angle. They are smiling as they yell:

                          DANNY
                I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A DEATH
                SENTENCE!

                          RUSTY
                FINE, THEN STAY HERE!


211   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         211

                          TOULOUR
                LeMarc told you. Of course.

      He looks deflated. It's probably just occurring to him that
      he's never lost before.

      He sits down.

                          TOULOUR
                To teach me.

      He is silent.

      Tess indicates to Danny that they should leave. Danny nods,
      and they rise.




                                                        (CONTINUED)

                                                               127.

                          DANNY
                Well, we'll be in touch to make all
                the arrangements.

                          TOULOUR
                No. Don't go. Please.

      Toulour gets up.

                          TOULOUR
                You are my guests. I will celebrate
                your victory. Besides, you may have
                noticed, I don't like to be alone.


212   EXT. VERANDA -- LATER                                    212

      They are toasting champagne.

                          TOULOUR
                I am feeling more French by the
                minute. To my first depression.


213   INT. TAXI -- DAY                                         213

      Saul and Basher ride to the airport.

                          BASHER
                So I think if you really analyze
                it, you can see that it's
                inevitable. It's time for us to
                evolve, en masse. I have to help
                bring that about whatever way I
                can, you know. Otherwise, the
                trajectory is fixed. You know what
                I'm saying?

                          SAUL
                Mmm. Yes. But I'm through evolving,
                I think. It's too tiring. I feel
                pretty evolved. You know,
                considering.


214   INT. AIRPORT -- DAY                                      214

      Frank and Yen buy magazines. Yen has a copy of an ITALIAN
      TABLOID. The headline screams CO-STAR SAYS JULIA MARRIAGE IN
      TROUBLE. A sub-headline reads HER ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS IS
      RIPPING THEM APART.

                                                                 128.




215   INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT                                     215

      In First Class. Basher and Saul tip champagne glasses.

      Virgil, Turk, and Linus all crack open copies of their story
      to read.

                          TURK
                I've got an idea for another
                Dominique story.

                          VIRGIL
                Can we finish this one first?

                          TURK
                Just let me tell it to you.

                          VIRGIL
                No.

                          TURK
                It's like three sentences.

                          VIRGIL
                I'm serious; you're asking too
                much.

      Virgil puts on his headset. Turk leans over to Linus and
      begins to speak. Linus, reading, holds his finger up.

      Yen reads a magazine. Reuben glances at it.

                          REUBEN
                May I look at that when you're
                through with it?

      Yen says something. It would seem he is okay with that.

      Livingston speaks into his VOICE RECORDER.

                          LIVINGSTON
                    (trying to be
                     dispassionate)
                All in all, it was depressingly
                familiar. The forced camaraderie,
                the hollow smiles. Scared to take a
                moment's reflection. Scared to
                imagine a different life. We
                behaved like boys.
                    (beat, he chokes)
                But...


                                                        (CONTINUED)

      He begins to weep, quietly, but very quickly regains his
      composure.

                           LIVINGSTON
                I'm Livingston Dell. Thanks for
                listening.


216   EXT. VILLA -- NIGHT                                        216

      Tess and Danny enjoy the sunrise.

                          TESS
                When do you want to go back?

                          DANNY
                Feel like traveling?

                          TESS
                Yeah. Don't you?

                            DANNY
                Yeah.

      Toulour enters with THE LAST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in tow.

                          TOULOUR
                Tess. Danny. This is Monica
                Bellucci.

      And indeed it is.

                            MONICA
                Hello.

                            TESS & DANNY
                Hello.

                          TOULOUR
                We're thinking of taking a trip to
                the states. Take a look around.
                We'd love to meet some of your
                friends while we're there.
                Actually, one friend in particular.


217   EXT. SKY OVER ZANZIBAR -- DAY                              217

      We follow the Gulfstream jet.

                                                                  130.




218   INT. JET -- DAY                                             218

      Isabel looks out the window. Rusty watches her, She looks
      over at him, then back out the window.


219   EXT. BEACH HOUSE -- DAY                                     219

      Stunning. Classic. Rusty and Isabel pull up.

      He takes her hand and leads her inside.


220   INT. BEACH HOUSE -- DAY                                     220

      Rusty and Isabel walk through the house.

                          RUSTY
                There he is.

      Rusty indicates the back porch. A figure sits in a lounge
      chair, reading a book. This is LEMARC.

                          RUSTY (cont'd)
                Gaspar!

                          ISABEL
                Gaspar? That was my fa--

      Isabel looks to the porch just as LE MARC, her father, turns
      to face her. She goes to him and they embrace.

                          ISABEL (cont'd)
                Daddy.

      LeMarc looks to Rusty.

      Rusty salutes, makes a drinking gesture and heads for the
      kitchen.

      The sound of a jet takes us to


221   A GLOBE                                                     221

      Staring at this receipt. He looks up.

      REUBEN

      Is opposite him. They are both being served for lunch by a
      JACKETED WAITER, whose face is continually obscured.

                             REUBEN
                   That's the exact figure, I'm pretty sure.

                             BENEDICT
                   Yes.

                             REUBEN
                   So we're clean?

                             BENEDICT
                   You want it in writing?

                             REUBEN
                   I'll take your word.

                   You're clean.

                             REUBEN
                   These grudges, they're awful.
                   Nobody wine.

                             BENEDICT
                   As soon as someone retaliates, the
                   situation is out of control.

                          REUBEN
                This way, there's no need for
                retaliation. Why would there be?

                          BENEDICT
                There's plenty for everyone.

                          REUBEN
                More than plenty. It's just a
                matter of sharing.

                          BENEDICT
                Sharing is good.

                          REUBEN
                It is. Waiter? Can I get sparkling
                water? It's good for my acid
                reflux.

                    (off)
                Of course.

      The waiter turns toward the bar and we see now that he is
      FRANCOIS TOULOUR. He's wearing a STRIPED TULIP in his
      WAITER'S JACKET.

[Scene: A highway. There's a huge traffic jam. Peter drives forward a 
bit at a time and he sees an old man with a walker on the sidewalk. The 
lane next to his is moving, so he switches lanes, only to have it stop 
and the lane he was on move. He switches back and then it happens 
again. The old man is now ahead of him.]

Cut to Michael, who's rapping along with the radio. A black guy selling 
papers walks by and he shuts the windows and turns down the volume. He 
passes and he turns it back up again.

Cut to Samir. He grabs the steering wheel and shakes it in frustration.

SAMIR
Motherf - shit - sonofa - ass!! I just -

He hits the steering wheel.

Cut to Milton at a bus stop. TN

He mumbles his coming lines, as he does with all his lines.

MILTON
It's late again. If I'm there late again, I will be dismissed.

[Scene: Initech parking lot. Bill drives into his special spot. 
(Reserved for Bill Lumbergh) He turns on the alarm for his Porsche 
(license plate: MY PRSHE) and walks in. Peter walks in too.]

Cut to inside. Peter pauses at the door and slowly reaches out to touch 
the metal handle. It gives him a shock and he enters.

Cut to the cubicles. Peter goes into his. He picks up papers, turns on 
the computer and sits down.

NINA
Corporate Counsels Payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment.

(repeats that over and over)

Bill comes up to Peter.

BILL
Hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh we have sort of a problem here. 
Yeah. You apparently didn't put one of the new coversheets on your TPS 
reports.

PETER
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry about that. I, I forgot.

BILL
MMMM..YEAH. YOU SEE, WE'RE PUTTING THE COVERSHEETS ON ALL TPS REPORTS 
NOW BEFORE THEY GO OUT. DID YOU SEE THE MEMO ABOUT THIS?

PETER
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've got the memo right here, but, uh, uh, I just 
forgot. But, uh, it's not shipping out until tomorrow, so there's no 
problem.

BILL
Yeah. If you could just go ahead and make sure you do that from now on, 
that will be great. And Uh, I'll go ahead and make sure you get another 
copy of that memo Mmmm, Ok?

He walks away.

PETER
Yeah, yeah, I've got the memo, I've got -

He picks it up but Bill's at another cubicle.

BILL
Hello, Phil. What's happening?

Peter tries to read his papers, but a loud radio (news) is bothering 
him. He stands up and sees it's Milton.

PETER
Milton? Uh, could you turn that down just a little bit?

MILTON
Uh, they said I could listen to the radio at a reasonable volume from 
nine to eleven while I'm collating.

PETER
But, no, no, no. I know you're allowed to, I was just thinking, like a 
personal favor, y'know?

MILTON
I, I told Bill that if Sandra's going to listen to her headphones while 
she' working, I can listen to the radio while I'm collating -

PETER
Ok.

MILTON
So I don't see why -

PETER
Ok.

MILTON
The radio, I can't -

PETER
Yeah! All right!

He sits down.

MILTON
I enjoy listening to the radio at a reasonable volume from nine to 
eleven.

Dom walks up.

DOM
Hello, Peter. What's happening?  (Big smile)We need to talk about your 
TPS reports.

PETER
Yeah. The coversheet. I know, I know. Uh, Bill talked to me about it.

DOM
Yeah. Uh, did you get that memo?

PETER
Yeah. (holds it up) I got the memo. And I understand the policy. The 
problem is, I just forgot this time. And I've already taken care of it 
so it's not a problem anymore.

Dom nods.

DOM
Yeah. It's just that we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS 
reports before now before they go out now. So I'd really appreciate it 
if you could just remember to do that. from now on. That'd be great.

He walks away. Peter's phone rings and he answers it.

PETER
Peter Gibbons. (listens) Yes. (listens) I have the memo.

[Scene Another part of the room. Paper jams in the printer.]

SAMIR
Oh no! Not again! Why does it say paper jam when there is no paper 
jam?!! I, I swear to God, one of these days, I, I, I just kick this 
piece of shit out the window!!!

MICHAEL
you and me both, man. The thing is lucky I'm not armed.

Samir grabs the paper out, tearing off the bottom part of it.

SAMIR
Piece of shit!!

Nina comes with papers.

NINA
Sam...ire...Na...Na...Naga...

Samir gets it.

NINA
Uh-huh!

SAMIR
Please.

He sits in his and Michael's cubicle.

NINA
Michael - (Michael reaches for it) Bolton?

MICHAEL
That's me.

NINA
Wow! Is that your real name?

MICHAEL
Yeah.

NINA
So are you related to the singer guy?

MICHAEL
No, it's just a coincidence.

SAMIR
How come no one in this country can pronounce my name right? It's Na-
gee-een-ah-jah. Nagaenajar

MICHAEL
At least your name isn't Michael Bolton.

SAMIR
Michael, there's nothing wrong with that name.

MICHAEL
There was nothing wrong with it. Until I was about nine years old and 
that no-talent assclown became famous and started winning Grammys.

SAMIR
Well, why don't just go by Mike, instead of Michael?

MICHAEL
 WHY SHOULD I CHANGE IT? HE'S THE ONE WHO SUCKS.

Peter comes up to their cubicle.

PETER
 HEY GUYS.

MICHAEL
What's up G?

PETER
Wanna go to Chotchkie's, get some coffee?

SAMIR
It's a little early...

PETER
I gotta get out of here. I think I'm gonna lose it.

NINA
Uh oh. Sounds like somebody's got a case of the Mondays.

[Scene Chotchkie's. They're sitting at a booth thing.]

PETER
Boy. I tell ya, one of these days... One of these days it's gonna be 
like

He mimics a machine gun. Brian, a waiter, does it too, in Peter's face.

BRIAN
(LAUGHS) 
SO CAN I GET YOU GENTLEMEN SOMETHING MORE TO DRINK? OR MAYBE SOMETHING 
TO NIBBLE ON? SOME PIZZA SHOOTERS, SHRIMP POPPERS, OR EXTREME FAJITAS.

PETER
Just coffee.

BRIAN
Oh. Sounds like a case of the Mondays.

He goes to take some more orders.

PETER
What if we're still doing this when we're 50?

SAMIR
It could be nice to have that kind of job security.

PETER
Lumbergh's gonna have me work on Saturday, I, I can tell already. I'm 
doing it because, because, uh, I'm a big pussy. Which is why I work at 
Initech to begin with.

MICHAEL
Uh, I work at Initech and I don't consider myself a pussy, ok?

SAMIR
Yes, I am also not a pussy.

MICHAEL
I'm gonna find out the hard way that I'm not a pussy if they don't 
start treating us software people better.

SAMIR
That's right.

MICHAEL
They don't understand. I could come up with a program that could rip 
that place off big timebig time.

PETER
Yeah.

Cut to Joanna, a pretty waitress.

Cut back to the guys.

PETER
Oh, there she is.

SAMIR
Peter, you, you always talk about this girl. If you're so obsessed with 
her, why don't you just ask her out?

PETER
Because I'm just another asshole customer. You can't just walk up to a 
waitress and ask her out. 
(cut to Joanna, and back to them) 
Plus, I'm still trying to work it out with Anne. Oh, that reminds me. 
I'm not going to be able to play poker with you guys on Friday.

MICHAEL
Why not?

PETER
Uh, I have to see this occupational hypnotherapist with Anne.

MICHAEL
Dude! An occupational hypnotherapist?!

PETER
Anne wants me to go. She thinks it might help. Y'know, sometimes I just 
think, I keep thinking that she's cheating on me.

MICHAEL
Yeah. I know what you mean.

SAMIR
Yeah.

PETER
What is that supposed to mean?

MICHAEL
Nothing. Why don't you just tell Anne you're not into hypnosis and you 
want to play poker with us?

PETER
Ah, I can't do that. She might get all pissed off at me. Besides, I 
think the guy might be able to help. He did help Anne lose weight.

SAMIR
Peter, she's anorexic.

PETER
Yeah, I know. The guy's really good.

MICHAEL
An occupational hypnotherapist isn't going to help you solve any of 
your problems. And speaking of problems, what's this I hear about you 
having problems with your TPS reports?

SAMIR
Yeah. Didn't you get that memo?

Peter sighs.

[Scene Outside Initech. Tom, another employee, runs across the street, 
towards Samir, Peter and Michael.]

TOM
Hey! Hey, guys! Samir!!

SAMIR
Is that Tom Smykowski?

PETER
What's he doing?

MICHAEL
Oh, probably working on another heart attack.

TOM
Have you guys see this?

He hands them a piece of paper.

MICHAEL
What? It's the staff meeting. So what?

TOM
We're all screwed, that's what. They're gonna downsize Initech.

SAMIR
Oh, what are you talking about Tom? How do you know that?

TOM
They're bringing in a consultant - that's how I know. That's what this 
staff meeting is all about! That's what happened at Initrode last year. 
You have an interview with a consultant and they bring in efficiency 
experts. You're interviewing for your own job!

MICHAEL
Tom, every week you say you're losing your job and you're still here.

TOM
I'm going to be the first one they're gonna lay off. Just the thought 
of having to go to the State Unemployment Office and having to stand in 
line with those scumbags!!!

[Scene Michael and Samir's cubicle. They're sitting there worrying.]

MICHAEL
Shit. Shit.

TOM
You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with 
all this shit? Like that guy that invented the pet rock. You see, 
that's what you have to do. You have to use your mind and come up with 
some really great idea like that and you never have to work again!

MICHAEL
I don't think the pet rock was really such a good idea.

TOM
The guy made a million dollars! Y'know I had an idea like that once.

PETER
Really? What was it, Tom?

TOM
Well, all right. It was a Jump to Conclusions-mat. You see, it would 
be this mat that you would put on the floor and it would have different 
conclusions written on it that you couldjump to.

MICHAEL
That is the worse idea I've ever heard in my life, Tom.

SAMIR
Yes, yes, it's horriblethis idea.

TOM
Ah, look. I, I gotta get outta here. I'll see you guys later, if I 
still have a job.

He goes to his cubicle.

PETER
Our high school guidance counselor used to ask us what you would do if 
we had a million dollars and didn't have to work. And invariably, 
whatever we would say, that was supposed to be our careers. If you 
wanted to build cars, then you're supposed to be an auto mechanic.

SAMIR
So what did you say?

PETER
I never had an answer. I guess that's why I'm working at Initech.

MICHAEL
No, you're working at Initech because that question is bullshit to 
begin with. 
(The printer is not working) 
If that quiz worked, there would be no janitors, because no one would 
clean shit up if they had a million dollars.

SAMIR
Well, I would invest half of it in ??? Mutual Funds and give the rest 
of it to my friend, Saheib, in Securities.

MICHAEL
Samir, the point of the exercise is that you could figure out what you 
want to do. And then
(reads the printer's display) 
"PC load letter"?!! What the fuck does that mean?!!

He knocks off the paper tray.

[Scene Peter's apartment. He enters, tired, and sits down on the couch. 
He then turns on the TV.]

LAWRENCE
(V/O, FROM NEXT DOOR) 
HEY PETER-MAN! CHECK OUT CHANNEL NINE! IT'S THE BREAST EXAM! CHECK OUT 
THIS CHICK!

PETER
Lawrence, can't you just pretend like we can't hear each other through 
the wall?

LAWRENCE
Oh! I'm sorry man, is Anne over there or something?

PETER
No! But if you just want to talk to me, just come over.

Lawrence does so; it takes him like ten seconds.

LAWRENCE
Hey man. Check this out, dude.

He changes channels a bunch of times

Pepsi commercial, a soap opera and another show. He stops on breast 
exam.

PETER
Oh geez, Lawrence.

LAWRENCE
I'm sorry, man. I thought you'd wanna see this. Doesn't this chick look 
like Anne?

PETER
Yeah, a little bit.

LAWRENCE
Hey, she hasn't been over here in a while. You two still going out?

PETER
I guess, yeah. I, I don't know. Sometimes I get the feeling that she's 
cheating on me.

LAWRENCE
Yeah, I get that feeling too, man.

PETER
What do you mean by that?

LAWRENCE
I don't know , man, I just get that feeling looking at her, like - I'm 
sorry, man. Look, I, I, I, I, I, I'm talking out of my ass. I don't 
know.

He gets up.

PETER
It's ok. I just had a rough day.

LAWRENCE
Tell me about it, man. 
(sits on the couch)
 I gotta wake my ass up at six AM every day of this week and drag 
myself up to Vascalinas. Yeah, I'm doing the drywall up there at the 
new McDonalds.

PETER
Let me ask you something. When you come in on Mondays, and you're not 
feeling too well, does anybody ever come up to you and say "sounds like 
someone's got a case of the Mondays"?

LAWRENCE
No. No, man, shit, no, man. I believe you get your ass kicked for 
sayin' something like that, man.

PETER
Huh.

LAWRENCE
We still going fishing this weekend?

PETER
Nah. Lumbergh's gonna make me come in this Saturday. I know it.

LAWRENCE
Well, you can get out of that easily.

PETER
Yeah, how?

LAWRENCE
(Gets up) 
Well, when you work on an Saturday, he generally asks you at the end of 
the day, right? 
(gets a beer) 
So all you have to do is avoid him  
(peter offers him a bottle cap remover) 
That's all right, i got one  
(he gets on from his pocket) 
The last few hours of the day. And turn off your answering machine, you 
should be home free then.

PETER
That's a really good idea. (sits on the couch) Lawrence, what would you 
do if you had a million dollars?

He sits down.

LAWRENCE
I'll tell you what I'll do, man--Two chicks at the same time.

Peter laughs.

PETER
That's it? If you had a million dollars, that's what you'd do, two 
chicks at the same time?

LAWRENCE
Damn straight, man. I've always wanted to do that. I figure if I were a 
millionaire, I could hook that up. Chicks dig guys with money.

PETER
Well not all chicks.

LAWRENCE
Well, the type that double up on a guy like me do.

PETER
Good point.

LAWRENCE
NOW, WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

PETER
Besides two chicks at the same time?

LAWRENCE
Oh yeah.

PETER
Nothing.

LAWRENCE
Nothing, huh?

PETER
I would relax, I would sit on my ass all day, I would do nothing.

LAWRENCE
You don't need a million dollars to do nothing, man. Take a look at my 
cousin. He's broke and don't do shit.

[Scene Peter's room. He's in bed and he keeps hearing voices.]

NINA
Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, 
Nina speaking. Just a moment. Corporate payroll, Nina speaking. Just a 
moment.

Peter buries his head in his pillow.

[Scene The staff meeting. Peter's watch reads Friday 12, 10:37. 
Everyone's standing outside their cubicles. There's a banner that says 
"Is This Good for the COMPANY?"]

BILL
So you should ask yourself, with every decision that you make (points 
to the banner) Is this good for the company? Am I helping the best way 
that I can for the company...

PETER
Is that the guy?

TOM
Yeah...

BILL
Good. Well, uh, I'd like to, uh, welcome a new member to our team. Uh, 
Bob Slydell. Yeah. Uh, he is, uh, a consultant. Yeah. He is a 
consultant. (Tom shakes his head) He'll be helping us out a little 
here, asking some questions, making sure things go a little more 
smoothly. Yeah. Oh and remember, next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day! So, 
y'know, if you want to, go ahead and uh, wear a Hawaiian shirt and 
jeans.

[Scene Milton's cubicle, under the banner. He's on the phone with 
Peter.]

MILTON
I, I don't care if they, if they lay me off either, because I, I told 
Bill that if he moves my desk one more time, then, then I'm quitting. 
I'm going to quit. And I told Dom too because they've moved my desk 
four times. I used to be by the window, where I could see the squirrels 
and they were merry. But then they switched from the Swingline to the 
Boston stapler, but I kept my Swingline. (he's holding his red 
Swingline) (Camera pans to Peter) They have my staples for the Boston 
and I kept the staples from the Swingline stapler.

PETER
Ok, Milton.

MILTON
And if, if they take my stapler, I will, I will set this building on 
fire.

PETER
Oh, that's great. I will talk to you later.

He hangs up and looks at his watch

4:45. Peter looks around and sees Bill. He ducks and peeks to see Bill 
talking with some workers. He quickly tries to save his files, but the 
computer is slower than he'd like. Bill is talking to other guys.

PETER
Oh, come on! (it finished saving, but starts to save another file) Oh, 
for crying out -!

He peeks over the wall again. The computer finally finished saving and 
he turns it off. He peeks over the wall but Bill's not there. He gets 
ready to leave and almost runs into Bill.

BILL
Hello Peter. What's happening? Um, I'm gonna need you go ahead and come 
in tomorrow. So if you could be here around nine, that would be great. 
(starts to walk away) Oh, oh, yeaI forgot. I'm gonna also need you to 
come in Sunday too. We, uh, lost some people this week and we need to 
sorta catch up. Thanks.

[Scene Outside the clinic. A sign says

Hypnotherapist; Dr. Swanson, CCS; Anxiety, Depression, Marriage, Weight 
Loss, Smoking, Insurance

Cut to inside. Anne is with Peter. Opposite them are Dr. Swanson and 
two other patients.

PETER
So I'm sitting in my cubicle today and I realized that ever since I 
started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the 
day before it. So it means that every single day you see me, that's on 
the worse day of my life.

DR. SWANSON
What about today? Is today the worse day of your life?

PETER
Yeah.

DR. SWANSON
Oh, that's bad stuff.

PETER
I'm sorry.

DR. SWANSON
Ok.

PETER
But is there any way that you, you could just sock me out so there's no 
way that I'll know I'm at work? Right here? (points to his head) Can I 
just come home and think I've been fishing all day or something?

DR. SWANSON
That's really not what I do, Peter. However, the good news is, I think 
I can help you. I want you to do something for me, Peter. (dims the 
lights) I want you to try and relax. I want you to relax every muscle 
in your body, from your toes to your fingertips. Now I want you to 
relax your legs. You're going to begin to feel your eyelids getting 
heavy as you slip deeper and deeper into a state of complete 
relaxation. the air of concerns to you is disappearing. Deeper, way 
down, your concerns about your job melts away. Way, way down. Now when 
I count backwards from three, you'll be in a state of complete 
relaxation. your worries, cares and ambitions will be gone. And you 
will remain in that state until I snap my fingers. Three. Deeper and 
deeper. Way down, way down. Two. Way down. One.

He faints out of the chair and everyone rushes to his aid.

ANNE
Oh my God, Dr. Swanson! Ooh! Ooh! Is he dead? Oh!

She runs to get help. Peter just sits there and smiles. The hypnosis 
thing apparently worked...

[Scene Peter's bedroom. Saturday morning, 8:00. His alarm clock beeps 
and he sits up. He looks at the clock and decides to go back to sleep.]

Cut to later. Peter's still asleep. The phone rings and the answering 
machine picks up.

BILL
Yah, hi. It's Bill Lundbergh. It's about ten o' clock, uh, wondering 
where you are.

Cut to later. Peter's still asleep. The phone rings again.

BILL
ON MACHINE) YEAH, HI, IT'S BILL LUMBERGH AGAIN. I JUST WANTED TO MAKE 
SURE YOU KNEW THAT WE, UH, DID START AT THE, UH, USUAL TIME THIS 
MORNING. (PETER ROLLS OVER...) YEAH, IT ISN'T A HALF DAY OR ANYTHING 
LIKE THAT. SO IF YOU COULD GET HERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, THAT WOULD BE 
TERRIFIC.

Cut to later. Peter finally gets up. The answering machine has 
seventeen messages. He listens to them.

BILL
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lum -

Next message

BILL
Yeah, it's -

Next message

BILL
Yeah, hi, it's Bill Lumbergh -

Next message

BILL
Yeah, it's me again. Uh, I was away from my desk for a minute. Just 
checking in case you called while I was gone.

The phone rings. Peter answers it.

PETER
Hello?

ANNE
Peter, what's going on?!

PETER
Huh?

ANNE
It's 3:30. Why aren't you at work?!

PETER
Because I didn't feel like it.

ANNE
Peter, what is wrong with you?! First, you sit there while Dr. Swanson 
dies and you just walk out of the car and embarrass me in front of my 
friends. Don't blame this on hypnosis either. That's total bull!

Peter hangs up but Anne calls back.

ANNE
ANSWERING MACHINE) LISTEN, ASSHOLE. NO ONE HANGS UP ON ME. WE'RE 
THROUGH!!! AND HA- ONE MORE THING. I'VE BEEN CHEATING ON YOU!!!! (BEEP

Peter gets back into bed.

[Scene Initech. Another staff meeting.]

BILL
From now on, you use the time sheets if you work on two or more job 
codes and you need the extra columns to fit it all in. Otherwise, use 
the old time sheets...

TOM
Where's Peter? How come he didn't show up this weekend?

MICHAEL
I, I don't know.

BILL
...it would really, really help us out.

MICHAEL
POINTS) WHO'S THAT GUY?

BILL
So, uh, any questions?

[Scene Chotchkie's. Peter enters and goes up to Joanna at the counter.]

PETER
Hi, I'm Peter.

JOANNA
Hi. How can I help you?

PETER
What are you doing for lunch today?

JOANNA
Well, our specials are barbecued chicken - it's actually right over 
there on the board. (points) Excuse me.

She goes to take orders.

BRIAN
Hey! Look who's back! Table for three, to -

Peter shoves him out of his way and goes over to Joanna.

PETER
I was asking what you were doing for lunch. Would you like to have 
lunch with me?

JOANNA
Oh, are you serious? Yeah, I don't , I don't think I'm supposed to do 
that.

PETER
Oh. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go next door and get a 
table and if you'd like to join me, no big deal. All right? And if not, 
that's cool too. Ok?

He starts to walk away.

JOANNA
Uh, when you say "next door", do you mean Chili's or Flingers?

PETER
Flingers.

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Initech. Bob Slydell and Bob Porter are interviewing Tom.]

BOB SLYDELL
So what you do is you take the specifications from the customers and 
you bring them down to the software engineers?

TOM
That, that's right.

BOB PORTER
Well, then I gotta ask, then why can't the customers just take the 
specifications directly to the software people, huh?

TOM
Well, uh, uh, uh, because, uh, engineers are not good at dealing with 
customers.

BOB SLYDELL
You physically take the specs from the customer?

TOM
Well, no, my, my secretary does that, or, or the fax.

BOB SLYDELL
Ah.

BOB PORTER
Then you must physically bring them to the software people.

TOM
Well...no. Yeah, I mean, sometimes.

BOB SLYDELL
Well, what would you say you do here?

TOM
Well, look, I already told you. I deal with the goddamn customers so 
the engineers don't have to!! I have people skills!! I am good at 
dealing with people!!! Can't you understand that?!? WHAT THE HELL IS 
WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!!!!!!!

CUT TO THE CUBICLES. TOM EXITS THE INTERVIEW ROOM AND MICHAEL ENTERS.

Cut to inside.

BOB SLYDELL
Let's see. You're Michael...Bolton?

He nods.

BOB PORTER
Is that your real name?

MICHAEL
Yeah.

BOB PORTER
Are you in any relation to the pop singer?

MICHAEL
It's just a coincidence.

BOB SLYDELL
LAUGHS) TO BE HONEST WITH YOU, I LOVE HIS MUSIC. I DO . I AM A MICHAEL 
BOLTON FAN. FOR MY MONEY, I DON'T THINK IT GETS ANY BETTER THAN WHEN HE 
SINGS WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN. 

BOB PORTER
I mean you must really love his music.

MICHAEL
Yeah. Yeahhe, he, he's pretty, he's pretty good, I guess.

BOB SLYDELL
You're GOD DAMN right he is.

They laugh.

BOB PORTER
So tell me. What's your favorite song of his?

MICHAEL
Hmm. I, I, I don't know. I mean, I guess, I sorta like 'em all.

The Bobs laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
HA HA! I feel the exact same way, but it must be hard for you, I mean, 
having the same name as him. I celebrate the guy's entire catalogue. 
But anyway, let's get down to business, Michael!

MICHAEL
You, you know, you can just call me Mike.

They stare at him.

[Scene Flingers. Peter is saving a table and Joanna enters.]

JOANNA
Hi.

PETER
Hey.

JOANNA
I wonder if they will let me wear this in here.

PETER
I think it would be ok. Would you like to sit down?

He motions to a chair.

JOANNA
Ok. (does so) Wow. This place is really nice.

PETER
Yeah, is it?

JOANNA
Oh my God, compared to Chotchkie's. I like the uniforms better anyways.

PETER
I like yours.

JOANNA
Nah. (makes a face

Peter looks at the buttons' wearing on his suspender. One says We're 
not in Kansas anymore. The one underneath says POOF.

PETER
"We're not in Kansas anymore."

JOANNA
Yeah. Really. (laughs

PETER
It's on your - (points

JOANNA
Oh! That's, uh, that's uh, my pieces of flair.

PETER
What are pieces of flair?

JOANNA
That's where you know, suspenders and buttons and all sorts of stuff. 
We're, uh, we're actually required to wear fifteen pieces of flair. 
quite stupid actually.

PETER
Do you get to pick them out yourself?

JOANNA
Yeah. Yeah. Although I didn't actually choose these. I, uh, I just 
grabbed fifteen buttons and, uh, I don't even know what they say! 
Y'know, I don't really care. I don't really like talking about my 
flair.

PETER
Ok.

JOANNA
So, where do you work, uh, Peter?

PETER
Initech.

JOANNA
And, uh, what do you do there, Peter?

PETER
I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.

JOANNA
NODS) WHAT'S THAT?

PETER
You see, they wrote all this bank software and to save space, they put 
98 instead of 1998. So I go through these thousands of lines of code 
and uh, it doesn't really matter. I, uh, I don't like my job. I don't 
think I'm gonna go anymore.

JOANNA
You're just not gonna go?

PETER
Yeah.

JOANNA
Won't you get fired?

PETER
I don't know. But I really don't like it so I'm not gonna go.

JOANNA
LAUGHS) SO YOU'RE GONNA QUIT?

PETER
No, no, not really. I'm just gonna stop going.

JOANNA
When did you decide all that?

PETER
About a week ago.

JOANNA
Really?

PETER
Oh, yeah.

JOANNA
Ok. So, so you're gonna get another job?

PETER
I don't think I 'd like another job.

JOANNA
LAUGHS) SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT MONEY AND BILLS?

PETER
Y'know, I never really liked paying bill? I don't think I'll do that 
either.

JOANNA
LAUGHS) SO WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

PETER
I want to take you out for dinner and then I wanna go to my apartment 
and watch Kung Fu. Did you ever watch Kung Fu? 

Joanna gets a weird look on her face.

JOANNA
I love Kung Fu...

PETER
Channel 39.

JOANNA
Totally...

PETER
You should come over and watch Kung Fu tonight.

JOANNA
Ok...

PETER
Great.

JOANNA
Ok. Can we order lunch first?

PETER
Yeah.

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Milton's cubicle. He hears bill talking and eavesdrops.]

BILL
...stapler off my desk...

Milton puts his Swingline stapler somewhere else. The guys laugh.

BILL
...anyway, sounds great, Bob. I'll see you in a few. (they walk off) 
Hey, Milton, what's happening?

MILTON
Uh...sir...

BILL
Uh, I'm going to have to ask you to move your desk. Now, if you could 
get it to go as far back against that wall as possible, that would be 
great.

MILTON
No, no, because I was, I was -

BILL
That way, we'll have some room for more boxes and things we need to put 
in here.

MILTON
No...sir...

BILL
Uh (sees the Swingline) Oh there it is.

MILTON
No. No.

BILL
Let me just get that from ya. (picks it up) Great. So if you could get 
to that as soon as possible, that would be terrific. Have a nice lunch, 
Milton. Bye.

He walks off.

MILTON
Ok. I'll set the building on fire.

[Scene Hallway at Initech. Peter enters in casual clothes. Milton walks 
up to him.]

MICHAEL
Peter!

PETER
Michael!

MICHAEL
What the hell's going on, man? I thought you were going to come in here 
and start shooting.

PETER
I just came to get my address book. I'm not gonna stay. I've got a 
number I don't wanna lose.

MICHAEL
What?! Peter, you're in deep shit! You were supposed to come in on 
Saturday. What were you doing?

PETER
Michael, I did nothing. I did absolutely nothing and it was everything 
that I thought it could be.

MICHAEL
Well, I hope you have a better story than that for Lumbergh. You know, 
you're supposed to be having your interview right now with the 
consultants.

PETER
Who?

He writes down Joanna's number.

MICHAEL
What has gotten into you?

PETER
Oh yeah. Right.

MICHAEL
Peter, Peter you, gotta postpone it man. Tell them you were sick. Make 
something up.

PETER
Ah, no way. I feel great.

[Scene The interview room.]

BOB PORTER
The next paper looks like a Peter Gibbons.

Peter enters.

BOB SLYDELL
Aha! All right. We were just talking about you. You must be Peter 
Gibbons. Uh huh. Terrific. I'm Bob Slydell and this is my associate, 
Bob Porter.

PETER
Hi, Bob. Bob.

BOB PORTER
Why don't you grab a seat and join us for a minute?

He does so.

BOB SLYDELL
Y'see, what we're trying to do here, we're just trying to get a feel 
for how people spend their day. So, if you would, would you just walk 
us through a typical day for you?

PETER
Yeah.

BOB SLYDELL
Great.

PETER
Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side 
door, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta 
space out for about an hour.

BOB PORTER
Space out?

PETER
Yeah. I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that 
for probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a 
given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.

BOB SLYDELL
Uh, Peter, would you be a good sport and indulge us and tell us a 
little more?

PETER
Let me tell you something about TPS reports...'

Cut to later. Peter is more relaxed.

PETER
The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy. It's just that I just don't 
care.

BOB PORTER
Don't, don't care?
PETER
It's a problem of motivation, all right? Now, if I work my ass off and 
Initech ships a few extra units, I don't see another dime. So where's 
the motivation? And here's another thing, Bob. I have eight different 
bosses right now!

BOB SLYDELL
I beg your pardon?

PETER
Eight bosses.

BOB SLYDELL
Eight?

PETER
Eight, bob. So that means when I make a mistake, I have eight different 
people coming by to tell me about it. That's my real motivation - is 
not to be hassled. That and the fear of losing my job, but y'know, Bob, 
it will only make someone work hard enough not to get fired.

BOB SLYDELL
Bear with me for a minute.

PETER
Ok.

BOB SLYDELL
Believe me, this is hypocritical. But what if you were offered some 
kind of stock option and equity sharing program?

PETER
I don't know. I guess. Listen, I'm gonna go. It's been really nice 
talking to be of you guys.

He shakes their hands.

BOB SLYDELL
Absolutely. It's all on this side of the table, trust me.

PETER
Good luck with your layoffs. I hope your firings go really well.

BOB SLYDELL
Wow.

Cut to the cubicle's. Peter walks past them and into the hall.

BILL
Hey, Peter, what's happening? Listen, uh -

Peter walks right past him.

[Scene Chotchkie's]

STAN
Joanna? Would you come here for a moment, please?

JOANNA
I'm sorry. I was late. I was having lunch.

STAN
I need to talk about your flair.

JOANNA
Really? I have 15 buttons on. I, uh, (shows him

STAN
Well, ok, 15 is minimum, ok?

JOANNA
Ok.

STAN
Now, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the bare 
minimum. Well, like Brian, for example, has 37 pieces of flair. And a 
terrific smile.

JOANNA
Ok. Ok, you want me to wear more?

STAN
Look. Joanna.

JOANNA
Yeah.

STAN
People can get a cheeseburger anywhere, ok? They come to Chotchkie's 
for the atmosphere and the attitude. That's what the flair's about. 
It's about fun.

JOANNA
Ok. So, more then?

STAN
Look, we want you to express yourself, ok? If you think the bare 
minimum is enough, then ok. But some people choose to wear more and we 
encourage that, ok? You do want to express yourself, don't you?

JOANNA
Yeah. Yeah.

STAN
Great. Great. That's all I ask.

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Conference room. Dom and Bill are talking to the two Bob's.]

BOB SLYDELL
Right. So there's three more people we can easily lose. There's Tom 
Smykowski.

BILL
He's useless.

BOB SLYDELL
Gone.

DOM
Sounds good to me.

BOB SLYDELL
Here's a peculiar one. Milton Waddams.

DOM
Who's he?

BOB
You know, squirrely looking guy, mumbles a lot.

DOM
Oh.

BOB SLYDELL
We can't find a record of him being a current employee here.

BOB PORTER
I looked into it more deeply and I found what happened was he got layed 
off about five years ago and no one ever told him about it. But through 
a glitch in Payroll, he still gets a paycheck. I went ahead and fixed 
the glitch.

BILL
Great.

DOM
So, um, Milton has been let go.

BOB SLYDELL
Just a second there, Professor. We, uh, we fixed the glitch. So he 
won't be receiving a paycheck anymore. So it'll just work itself out 
naturally.

BOB PORTER
We always like to avoid confrontation whenever possible. The problem is 
solved from here on, then.

They laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
Uh, we should move on to a Peter Gibbons. I had a chance to meet this 
young man and boy does he have Straight to Upper Management written all 
over him.

BILL
Ooh, uh, yeah. I'm going to have to go ahead and sort of disagree with 
you there. Yeah. Uh, he's been real flaky lately and I'm not sure that 
he's the caliber person you want for upper management. He's been having 
some problems with his TPS reports.

BOB PORTER
I'll handle this. We feel that the problem isn't with Peter.

BOB SLYDELL
Um-um.

BOB PORTER
It's that you haven't challenged him enough to get him really 
motivated.

BOB SLYDELL
There it is.

BILL
Yeah, I'm not sure about that now.

BOB PORTER
All right, Bill. Let me ask you this. How much time each week would you 
say you deal with these TPS reports?

BILL
Yeah...

[Scene Peter parks in Bill's usual spot and goes into the building. He 
takes a drill and removes the metal door handle.]

Cut to outside, where Bill has to park in the handicap spot.

Cut back inside. Peter tears down the banner.

Cut to outside. Bill's Porsche is being towed away. They only manage to 
pull off the bumper.

Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu. They're about to kiss.

LAWRENCE
Hey Peter man! Check out channel nine! It's a breast exam! Whoo!!

Cut to Peter's cubicle. Bill checks his watch because Peter's still not 
there.

Cut to a lake. Lawrence, Peter and Joanna are fishing. Peter holds up a 
big fish.

Cut to Initech. Peter enters with an Igloo cooler.

DOM
Hello, Peter.

PETER
Hey Dom!

He slaps him on the back.

Cut to Peter's cubicle. He puts the fish on his desk and starts to gut 
it. He throws its entrails on a stack of TPS reports.

Cut to Peter and Joanna watching Kung Fu.

Cut to Peter removing the screws in the cubicle wall. He pushes it 
over. It reveals a window and Peter relaxes.

[Scene Peter's cubicle, now with only one wall. he's playing Tetris as 
Bill walks up.]

BILL
So, Peter, what's happening? Now are you going to go ahead and have 
those TPS reports for us this afternoon? (Peter keeps playing) Uh, 
yeah. So I guess we should probably go ahead and have a little talk, 
hmm?

PETER
Not right now, Lumbergh. I'm, I'm kinda busy. In fact, I'm going to 
have to ask you to go ahead and just come back another time. I have a 
meeting with the Bobs in a couple of minutes.

BILL
Uh, I wasn't aware of a meeting with them.

PETER
Yeah, they called me at home.

BILL
That sounds good, Peter. Uh, and we'll go ahead and, uh, get this all 
fixed up for you later.

[Scene Milton's cubicle. He's organizing papers.]

MILTON
F...C...P...

BILL
Hi, Milton. What's going on?

MILTON
I, I, I, I, I didn't receive my paycheck this week.

BILL
Uh, you're gonna have to talk to Payroll about that.

MILTON
I, I did and they, and they said -

BILL
Uh, we're gonna need to move your desk downstairs into Storage B.

MILTON
No...I...I...

BILL
Uh, we have some new people coming in and we need all the space we can 
get.

MILTON
No...no...no...no...but...but...but...I, I, I -

BILL
And if you could could go ahead and get a can of psticide and take care 
of the roach problem we've been having that would be great. (He walks 
away.

MILTON
I can't...Excuse me. I believe you have my stapler?

[Scene The meeting between Peter and the two Bobs.]

BOB PORTER
It looks like you've been missing a lot of work lately.

PETER
I wouldn't say I've been missing it, Bob.

They laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
That's terrific, Peter. I,I, I'm sure you've, you've, you've heard some 
of the rumors around the hallway about how we're just going to do a 
little (finger quotes) housecleaning with some of the software people.

PETER
Well, Bob, I have heard that and you gotta do what you gotta do.

BOB PORTER
Well, these people here. First, Mr. Samir Naga...Naga...

BOB SLYDELL
Naga...

BOB PORTER
Naga-worker here anyway!

The Bobs laugh.

BOB SLYDELL
Mr. Mike Bolton. We're certainly gonna miss him.

PETER
You're gonna layoff Samir and Michael!?

BOB PORTER
We're gonna bring in some entry level graduates for us to work in 
Singapore, that's the usual deal.

BOB SLYDELL
Well, it's standard operating procedure.

PETER
Do they know about this yet?

BOB SLYDELL
No! No, of course not. We always find it's better to fire people on a 
Friday. It's statistically shown that there's less chance of an 
incident if we do it at the end of the week. Anyway, Peter, what we 
would like to do is put you into a position where you would have as 
many as four people working right underneath you.

BOB PORTER
This is a big promotion, Pete.

BOB SLYDELL
Huge.

PETER
So you're gonna fire Samir and Michael and give me more money?

BOB SLYDELL
Umm-hmm.

PETER
Wow!

[Scene Michael is messing with the printer.]

MICHAEL
Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's exactly what I need. Just give it to me. 
Come on. Come on, you little fucker. Let's go! That's what I need. 
Let's do that. Let's do exactly that, you little, fu-

Peter walks up to him.

PETER
Listen... Well, what are you doing tonight?

[Scene Peter's place. Michael, Samir and Peter are there.]

PETER
There comes a place in a man's life and, uh, maybe that time for you is 
now, when it doesn't hurt to think about the future.

MICHAEL
Uh, no offense, there, Peter, but think about yourself, sport. You're 
the one who's been flaking out at work. Whatever that religious 
experience or whatever the hell it was, you better snap out of it, or 
you're gonna get canned.

PETER
Yeah. I, I, I...Listen, that virus you're always talking about. The one 
that, that could rip off the company for a bunch of money...

MICHAEL
Yeah? What about it?

PETER
Well, how does it work?

MICHAEL
It's pretty brilliant. What it does is where there's a bank 
transaction, and the interests are computed in the thousands a day in 
fractions of a cent, which it usually rounds off. What this does is it 
takes those remainders and puts it into your account.

PETER
This sounds familiar.

MICHAEL
Yeah. They did this in Superman III.

PETER
Yeah. What a good movie.

MICHAEL
A bunch of hackers did this in the 70s and one of them got busted.

PETER
Well, so they check for this now?

MICHAEL
No, you see, Initech's so backed up with all the software we're 
updating for the year 2000, they'd never notice.

PETER
You're right. And even if they wanted to, they could never check all 
that code.

MICHAEL
It's numbers up their asses.

PETER
So, Michael, what's to keep you from doing this?

MICHAEL
It's not worth the risk. I got a good job.

PETER
What if you didn't have a good job?

[Scene A bar. Michael and Peter are there.]

MICHAEL
Cockos! Samir and I are the best programmers in that place. And you, 
you haven't even been showing up and you get to keep your job.

PETER
Actually, I'm being promoted.

MICHAEL
What?!!!

PETER
Yeah, I know, Michael. It's completely unfair. And I realized something 
today. It's not about me and my dream of doing nothing. It's about all 
of us together. I don't know what happened at that hypnotherapist the 
other day; maybe it was just shock. It's wearing off now, but when I 
saw that fat man keel over and die, Michael, I realized that we don't 
have a lot of time on this earth. We weren't meant to spend it this 
way. Human beings weren't meant to sit in little cubicles, starring at 
computer screens all day, filling out useless forms and listening to 
eight different bosses drone on about mission statements.

MICHAEL
I told those fudge-packers that I like Michael Bolton's music. God.

PETER
that is not right, Michael. For five years now, you've worked your ass 
off at Initech, hoping for a promotion or some kind of profit sharing 
or something. Five years of your mid-20s now, gone. And you're gonna go 
in tomorrow and they're gonna throw you out into the street. You know 
why? So Bill Lumbergh's stock will go up a quarter of a point. Michael, 
let's make that stock go down. Let's take enough money from that place 
that we never ever have to sit in a cubicle ever again. Your software 
works right?

MICHAEL
Of course it works. That's not the point. Look, even if it could work, 
I don't know how to install it. I don't know the credit union software 
loan.

PETER
Yeah? But Samir does.

[Scene Peter's apartment. Samir's there, along with Michael and Peter.]

SAMIR
But that's not much money, I -

PETER
That's the beauty of it. Each withdrawal is a fraction of a cent. 
That's too small to notice. Take a thousand withdrawals a day, space it 
out over a few years, that's a couple hundred thousand dollars.

MICHAEL
Just like Superman III.

SAMIR
Superman III - that's it, I have to leave now, ok? (gets up) I have to 
get my resume ready.

PETER
Get your resume ready for what? Another job where they can fire you for 
no reason?

SAMIR
That's right! If I'm lucky.

PETER
Look, I don't know about you guys, but I'm tired of being pushed 
around. Aren't you?

SAMIR
Yes, Peter, but I'm not going to do something illegal.

PETER
Illegal? Samir, this is America! Come on, sit down! Come on! This isn't 
Riyadh! They're not gonna saw your hands off, all right? The worse they 
can do is put you for a couple of months into a while collar, minimum 
security resort! Shit, we should be so lucky! Did you know they have 
conjugal visits there?

SAMIR
Really.

PETER
Yes.

MICHAEL
Shit, I'm afraid. I haven't had a conjugal visit in six months.

SAMIR
So what do you think?

MICHAEL
This thing actually is pretty fail-safe, Samir.

PETER
You came here looking for a land of opportunity. And this is the knock 
of that opportunity. Tomorrow's your last day at Initech. You have two 
options

unemployment or early retirement. What's it gonna be?

SAMIR
I have a question.

PETER
Yes.

SAMIR
In, in these conjugal visits, you can have sex with women?

PETER
Yep. You sure can.

SAMIR
Ok. I'm gonna do it.

PETER
That's what I'm talking about! I'm talking about America!!

MICHAEL
Peter Let's discuss the plan, all right?

PETER
All right.

MICHAEL
All right. It works like a computer virus. All right? So all we have to 
do is load it anywhere into the credit union mainframe and it'll do the 
rest.

PETER
Ok, you guys give me that disk and I'll take it from there. Oh, but 
listen. Before we go any further, all right, we have to swear to God, 
Allah, that nobody knows about this, all right? No family members, no 
girlfriends, nobody!

SAMIR
Of course.

MICHAEL
Agreed.

LAWRENCE
Don't worry man! I won't tell anybody about this either!

MICHAEL
Who the fuck is that?!

PETER
Uh, don't worry about him. He's cool. All right. Now here's how I see 
it all going down...

[Scene Initech. Peter shakes the Bobs' hands.]

BOB SLYDELL
Peter, congratulations. This is one heck of a promotion.

BOB PORTER
And we'll go ahead and get some people under you right away.

 (They give a thumbs up.

[Scene Samir and Michael's cubicle. They look at each other. Michael 
copies the virus and looks around. He gives it to Samir. Samir walks by 
Peter and gives it to him. He puts it into his computer and copies the 
file. He goes to Samir and Michael's cubicle.]

MICHAEL
Well, that was easy.

PETER
Yeah, I guess it was.

MICHAEL
What did you do with the -

DREW
Hey guys.

PETER
Oh, hey Drew.

DREW
did you guys hear about Tom Smykowski?

MICHAEL
The guy who got laid off?

DREW
No, man, check this out.

[Flashback. Tom's getting drunk in his kitchen.]

DREW
V/O) LAST WEEK, AFTER HE FOUND OUT HE WAS GETTING LAID OFF, HE TRIES TO 
KILL HIMSELF BY RUNNING THE CAR IN THE GARAGE.

Cut to Tom in his car.

MICHAEL
V/O) IS HE DEAD?!

DREW
V/O) BUT THAT WIFE OF HIS COMES HOME EARLY FROM WORK EARLY AND FOUND 
HIM IN THE CAR AND TRIES TO PLAY IT OFF AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED.

TOM
COUGH) I WAS HAVING SOME TROUBLE WITH THE SHIFTER HERE. IT'S JAMMED. I, 
I COULDN'T GET IT INTO DRIVE. I, I, I MEAN, REVERSE.

MRS. SMYKOWSKI
Are you ok, Tom?

TOM
Yeah.

DREW
V/O) AND THEN, AS HE'S LOOKING AT HER, HE DECIDES HE WANTS TO LIVE.

TOM
I'm ok.

MRS. SMYKOWSKI
Right.

TOM
It seems to be working now. See ya later, honey. Love ya.

He backs out.

DREW
V/O) BUT THEN AS HE BACKS OUT INTO HIS DRIVEWAY, HE'S SLAMMED BIG TIME 
BY A DRUNK DRIVER.

We hear a bang from behind the closing garage door.

Cut back to Initech, present.

PETER
Well, is he ok?

DREW
Sort of. He broke both his wrists, his legs, a couple of ribs, his 
back. But check it out. He's gonna get a huge settlement out of this. 
Like seven figures. He's getting out of the hospital this weekend and 
he's throwing a big party to celebrate. I'm thinking I'm gonna take 
that new chick from Logistics. I might be showing her my O face. Oh! 
Oh! Oh! you know what I'm talking about. Oh! Yeah. Right. See you guys 
there.

[Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael are with him.]

MICHAEL
Wow, our last day at Initech.

SAMIR
I can't believe they had security escort us out. Not like we're gonna 
steal something.

PETER
I stole something.

MICHAEL
Oh yeah. I guess we all did.

PETER
No, I stole something else.

SAMIR
What did you steal?

PETER
We'll call it a going away present.

[Scene A field. They drop the printer. Samir stomps on it four times 
and Michael, eight times. Peter hands Samir a bat. He hits the printer 
twice and Michael takes over. He starts to punch it. Samir and Peter 
pull him away, but he runs back to destroy the evil printer.]

Cut to Peter's place. Samir's trying to break dance.

[Scene Outside Peter's place.]

PETER
Everything is going to be ok. Ok?

SAMIR
The one I see is -

PETER
I can see this working. I gotta go. I gotta go. Joanna's coming over. 
Don't worry! You're worrying! All right? Monday morning we're gonna 
check the account balance and everything will be all right. Don't miss 
Tom's barbecue. I'll see you there.

Peter goes inside.

SAMIR
RAPPING) BACK UP IN YOUR ASS WITH THE RESURRECTION...

[Scene Peter's place, morning. Joanna sees all the empty liquor 
bottles.]

JOANNA
Hey, what were you guys celebrating last night?

PETER
Um, I'm not really at liberty to talk about it. I really can't.

[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are going to the barbecue.]

PETER
So when the subroutine compounds the interest, right, it uses all these 
extra decimals places that just get rounded off. So we just simplify 
the whole thing and we just round it down and drop the remainder into 
an account that we own.

JOANNA
So you're stealing.

PETER
Ah, no. No. You don't understand. It's, uh, very complicated. It's, uh, 
it's, it's aggregate so I'm talking about fractions of a cent that, uh, 
over time, they add up to a lot.

JOANNA
Ok. So you're gonna make a lot of money, right?

PETER
Yeah.

JOANNA
Ok. That's not yours?

PETER
Well, it, it becomes ours.

JOANNA
How's that not stealing?

PETER
I don't think, I don't think I'm explaining this very well. Um, this 
Seven Eleven, right? If you take a penny from the tray -

JOANNA
From the crippled children?!

PETER
No, that's the tray. I'm talking about the tray. The penny's for 
everybody.

JOANNA
Oh, for everybody. Ok.

PETER
Yeah, well, those are whole pennies.

JOANNA
Yeah.

PETER
Right. I'm just talking about fractions of a penny here, but we do it 
from a much bigger tray. A couple of million times. So what's wrong 
with that?

JOANNA
It seems wrong.

PETER
It's not wrong. Initech is wrong. Initech is an evil corporation, all 
right? Chotchkie's is wrong. Doesn't it bother you that you have to get 
up in the morning and put on pieces of flair?

JOANNA
Yeah, but I'm not about to go in and start taking money from the 
register!

PETER
You know, the Nazis had pieces of flair but they made the Jews wear 
them.

JOANNA
What?!

PETER
Look, we don't - I, I - we don't have to talk about this. Let's just go 
to the barbecue, all right?

JOANNA
Ok.

[Scene Tom's house. Samir and Michael open the front door. tom is in a 
full body cast and is hooked up to a bunch of stuff.]

TOM
Michael! Samir! How are you doing?

MICHAEL
Hiya Tom.

SAMIR
Hi Tom.

TOM
Yeah, I'd like you to meet my lawyer, Rob Newhouse. (they shake hands) 
Rob, Michael.

ROB
Hello Michael.

TOM
Samir.

ROB
Hello -

SAMIR
Samir.

ROB
...Samir.

 (Peter and Joanna enter.

TOM
Peter!! How are ya? I'm glad you could make it.

PETER
Tom! Hi! This is someone I'd like you to meet. This is Joanna.

JOANNA
Hi.

TOM
Hi. Forgive me for not getting up. (He starts laughing and everyone 
joins in nervously) Ooh...Ooh... Uh, Peter, Peter, come here a minute. 
I want to show you something.

They go into the kitchen. There's a Jump to Conclusions mat. It says 
??? ; Jump Again ; Strike Out ; Could be ; Loose one Turn ; Yes! ; No! 
; Accept it ; Go wild ; One step back ; Think Again ; Moot! On the 
bottom are footprints, under the word Start

TOM
Well, what do you think? It's a prototype.

PETER
Well, that's exactly as you described it. Uh, listen, I, I heard about 
your settlement. Congratulations.

TOM
Well, thanks, Peter. y'know, I'm glad you're here because I wanted to 
talk to you. I know how you get depressed about your job and all, and I 
just wanted you to know that's how you feel. I used to be the same way.

PETER
Really?

TOM
Sure. Oh maybe I didn't whine as much, but I hated my job as much as 
you and I've been doing good for over thirty years!

PETER
Wow.

TOM
Just remember

If you hang in there long enough, good things can happen. I mean, look 
at me.

He laughs.

PETER
Thanks Tom.

TOM
Aw, sure.

[Scene The backyard. Samir and Michael are talking to Rob.]

ROB
Conjugal visits? Not that I know of. Now, a minimum security prison is 
no picnic. I have a client in there right now. You see, the trick is, 
kick someone's ass the first day or become someone's bitch. Then 
everything will be all right. Why do you ask, anyway?

MICHAEL
Oh, no, we were just seeing -

His cup flies out of his hand and ice cubes go everywhere.

Cut to Peter and Drew.

DREW
Hey Peter.

PETER
Drew.

DREW
That's something about old Tom Smykowski, huh?

PETER
Yeah.

DREW
Lucky bastard. (sees Joanna) Hey, isn't that the girl who works over at 
Chotchkie's?

PETER
Yeah.

DREW
Hmm, who's she here with?

PETER
She's here with me.

DREW
Really?

PETER
Yeah.

DREW
All right, Peter! Ooh! Ooh! Right on. Make sure you wear a rubber, 
dude.

PETER
Why's that, Drew?

DREW
Are you kidding me? She gets around, all right?

PETER
She does, does she?

DREW
Oh yeah. Like a record.

Joanna waves.

PETER
With who?

DREW
Well, let's see. Lumbergh fucked her. Ah, let me see who else...

PETER
Lumbergh?!

[Scene Peter's car. He and Joanna are leaving the party.]

JOANNA
Oh, what if you get caught? Oh, I, I, I, I just don't know if this is 
such a good idea.

PETER
ANGRY) YEAH? WELL, MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU TO SLEEP 
WITH LUMBERGH!

JOANNA
What?! What are you - Oh! All right, Lumbergh...

PETER
ARGH!!! AH GOD! LUMBERGH!!

JOANNA
Peter! What is wrong with you? That was like to years ago! What, do you 
know him?

PETER
Yeah, I know him!! I know him! He's my boss!! He's my unholy, 
disgusting, pig of a boss!!

JOANNA
Oh, he's not that disgusting.

PETER
He represents all that is solace and wrong! And you slept with him!

JOANNA
That is none of your business, ok? I didn't ask you who you slept with 
before we were together. I don't care!

PETER
Well, I didn't think you would sleep with a guy like Lumbergh!

JOANNA
Listen to you! Who do you think you are? How dare you judge! Do you 
think you're an angel or something? No! You're this petty, stealing, 
wannabe criminal...man!

PETER
Well, I may be. But at least I never slept with Lumbergh!!

JOANNA
Ok. That's it. I'm done. I want to get out of the car. Stop. I wanna 
get -

PETER
Fine.

He stops and Joanna gets out.

JOANNA
Why don't you call me when you grow up? Oh, wait, that's probably never 
gonna happen so just don't call me, all right?

PETER
Say hello to Lumbergh for me!!!

She slams the door and he drives off.

[Scene Peter's room. He's having nightmares again.]

DREW
Lumbergh fucked her...Lumbergh fucked her...Lumbergh fucked her...

BILL
Oh that's greatgreat

DREW
I'm gonna see the O-face again. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ooh! Ooh!

That dissolves into Bill, naked, holding a foot in one hand a cup of 
coffee in the other.

BILL
Why don't you move it a little to the left? That's right. Great. Oh, 
hello, Peter. What's happening? Uh, could you give me those TPS reports 
ASAP? Mmmkay?

Peter wakes up and breathes deeply.

[Scene Chotchkie's. Stan approaches Joanna.]

STAN
Joanna?

JOANNA
Yeah?

STAN
We need to talk. Do you know what this is about?

JOANNA
My, uh, flair.

STAN
Yeah. Or, uh, your lack thereof. I'm counting and I only see fifteen 
pieces. Let me ask you a question, Joanna.

JOANNA
Umm-hmm.

STAN
What do you think of a person who only does the bare minimum?

JOANNA
Huh. What do I think? Let me tell you what I think, Stan. If you want 
me to wear thirty-seven pieces of flair like your pretty boy Brian over 
there, then why don't you just make the minimum thirty-seven pieces of 
flair?

STAN
Well, I thought I remember you saying you wanted to express yourself.

JOANNA
Yeah. Yeah. Y'know what? I do. I do want to express myself. Ok? And I 
don't need thirty-seven pieces of flair to do it. (gives him the 
finger) All right? There's my flair! And this is me expressing myself. 
(holds up her hand) There it is! I hate this job! I hate this goddamn 
job and I don't need it!!

She storms out.

[Scene An ATM machine. Peter gets out a receipt that says he has 
$305,326.13]

 [Scene Peter's car. Samir and Michael have obviously seen the 
receipt.]

SAMIR
Shit, shit, shit, shit. Son of a bitch! Shit! This is a - fuck! Son of 
a bitch! Shit!

MICHAEL
What happened?

PETER
You tell me, Michael, it's your software!

SAMIR
Yes, it's your software!

PETER
Corporate accounting is sure as hell going to notice 305, 3 (grabs the 
receipt) 26.13!! Michael!!

MICHAEL
Oh shit! They, they probably won't notice it's gone for another two or 
three days.

PETER
Michael! Michael! You said the thing was gonna take two years!

SAMIR
What happened?!

PETER
You said the thing was supposed to work.

MICHAEL
Well, technically it did work.

PETER
No it didn't!

SAMIR
It did not work, Michael, ok?!

MICHAEL
Ok! Ok!

SAMIR
Ok?!

MICHAEL
Ok! Ok! I must have, I must have put a decimal point in the wrong place 
or something. Shit. I always do that. I always mess up some mundane 
detail.

PETER
Oh! What is this fairly mundane detail, Michael?!!!!!

MICHAEL
Ok quit getting pissed at me, all right? This was all your idea, 
asshole.

PETER
All right. Ok. All right. Let's try not to get pissed off at each 
other, all right? We'll figure this thing out together, ok? And the 
first thing we gotta do is we gotta close that account down before it 
gets any bigger.

[Scene Initech. It's Bill's 41st birthday. All the employees are 
singing the birthday song to him in a flat monotone. He blows out the 
candles and everyone claps.]

ALL
Mmm. You look terrific. (etc

BILL
All right, Kate, you wanna get everybody started there. (he gets a 
slice of cake) Mmm. That is terrific. That is just terrific. I really, 
really appreciate it.

A slice is handed to Milton.

NINA
Milton, don't be greedy. Let's pass it along and make sure everyone 
gets a piece.

MILTON
Can I keep a piece? Because last time I was told that -

NINA
Just pass.

He does so.

MILTON
But this, this, it, it, it's a little cake...

Everyone gets a piece and Nina gets the last one. Milton has to watch 
everyone enjoy their piece.

[Scene Peter's apartment. They're trying to figure out what to do.]

SAMIR
Is, is there a way to just give the money back?

PETER
What? We just hand them a check with the exact amount they're missing? 
I, I think they'd figure that out.

SAMIR
Well, we have to do something.

MICHAEL
May-maybe we launder the money.

PETER
That's a great idea. Ok, how do we do that?

MICHAEL
I don't know, I don't know. I don't even know what it means. It's 
something I think, I think coke dealers do.

PETER
Ok. Do we know any coke dealers?

MICHAEL
My, my cousin's a cokehead. We're in deep shit.

SAMIR
Yes. We are in very, very deep shit.

[Scene Milton's new "office" - the basement. Bill enters with a piece 
of cake.]

BILL
Milton?

MILTON
Yes.

BILL
What's happening?

MILTON
I wanted to see you because -

BILL
Say, you know what would be a great idea?

MILTON
No...no.

BILL
Since you're already down here, it would be great if you could get a ca 
of pesticipe and take care of the cockroach problem we've been having 
in here.

MILTON
I...I...that's really not my job and I haven't received my -

BILL
For now, why don't you get a flashlight and a can of pesticide and -

Dom enters.

DOM
Bill! We need you upstairs right away. Some major glitch in the 
accounting. A lot of money missing.

They go upstairs and Bill turns off the light.

MILTON
Excuse me? Excuse me? Ok, that's the last straw.

[Scene Peter's place. Michael is looking up "money laundering" in the 
dictionary.]

MICHAEL
LAUNDERING. TO CLEAN...NO, UH, HERE IT IS. TO CHANNEL MONEY THROUGH A 
SOURCE OR BY AN INTERMEDIARY.

SAMIR
It doesn't really help us, Michael.

PETER
Ok. We're looking up money laundering in a dictionary.

MICHAEL
Yeah, well, you guys can both eat my ass, ok?

PETER
My girlfriend slept with Lumbergh, that's what I can't believe.

SAMIR
Yeah, you didn't know that?

MICHAEL
It happened two years before you moved to Atlanta.

PETER
You mean, Ron Lumbergh, the airshow guy?

MICHAEL
Yeah, who did you think she slept with, Bill? (He and Samir start 
laughing) If she fucked him, their children would have hooves!

PETER
Ron's not related to Bill, is he?

Someone rings the doorbell.

MICHAEL
Who is it?

He hides the checks while Peter goes to the door.

PETER
Don't panic. It's probably just the mailman.

He opens the door.

STEVE
MONOTONOUSLY) HELLO SIR. MY NAME IS STEVE. I CAME FROM A ROUGH AREA. I 
USED TO BE ADDICTED TO CRACK BUT NOW I'M OFF AND TRYING TO STAY CLEAN.

PETER
Ok.

STEVE
That is why I am selling magazine subscriptions.

PETER
No -

STEVE
I was hoping you would help me out.

MICHAEL
Wait, wait, wait, wait! You used to be addicted to crack?

STEVE
Yes, but not anymore.

Cut to later. They've got Steve in an armchair, trying to get him to 
help.

STEVE
Look, I'm sorry. I do not know anything about money laundering.

MICHAEL
Look, we're not asking you if you know about money laundering, we're 
just trying to see if you can hook us up.

PETER
He doesn't know anything, all right?

SAMIR
Wait, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just give us the name of 
one drug dealer. I could talk to him. I have good networking skills.

STEVE
NORMAL) I LIED. ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT ME BEING A CRACKHEAD WAS TO HELP 
ME SELL MAGAZINES. I'M A SOFTWARE ENGINEER.

PETER
You're a software engineer?!

SAMIR
Working must be, must be very hard for you.

STEVE
I made more money selling magazine subscriptions than I ever did 
working at Initrode.

MICHAEL
Huh? You worked at Initrode?

PETER
You can't tell anybody about any of this stuff I told you. I mean, we 
know a lot of the same people.

STEVE
Actually, that all depends.

He holds up his clipboard.

Cut to later. Peter closes the door.

PETER
What am I going to do with forty subscriptions to Vibe ?

MICHAEL
I wish we had never done this. What are we going to do? You know what I 
can't figure out? How is it that all these stupid, Neanderthal, Mafia 
guys can be so good at crime and smart guys like us can suck so badly 
at it?

SAMIR
We're new to it, though. If we had more experience -

MICHAEL
No. No. Y'know what I think? I think we're screwed. There's evidence 
all over that building to link it to us. Even if we could launder 
money, I wouldn't want to. If we're caught while laundering money, 
we're not going to go to white-collar-resort-prison. No, no, no. We're 
gonna go to federal-reserve-pound-me-in-the-ass-prison.

SAMIR
I don't want to go to any prison! Why the hell did I do this?! I've 
never done anything wrong in my whole life! We weren't thinking clearly 
because you told us we were losing our jobs! And look at us now, we're, 
we're worried about going to prison!

PETER
Don't worry about it. I'll think of something.

SAMIR
Ass. I'm going home. You are a very bad person, Peter.

Samir and Michael leave. Peter knocks on the wall.

PETER
Lawrence! You awake?

LAWRENCE
Yeah, man!

PETER
You wanna come over?

LAWRENCE
No thanks, man. I don't want you fucking up my life too!

[Scene Peter's room. He dreams that they're in court, with Rob as their 
lawyer.]

JUDGE
And now the sentence for these heinous crimes committed against 
Initech. I hereby sentence you, Michael Bolton and Samir 
Na...Ananajibad...to a term of no less than four years in federal-
pound-me-in-the-ass-prison. Peter Gibbons, you've lead a trite and 
meaningless life. And you're a very bad person.

The judge bangs the gavel and Peter wakes up.

[Scene The living room. Peter is up, feverishly writing a confession. 
He tears it out and puts it into an envelope with the checks.]

[Scene Flingers parking lot. Peter sits on the hood of his car, trying 
to figure out what to do. Joanna comes out.]

JOANNA
Hey.

PETER
Hey. You're not working at Chotchkie's anymore.

JOANNA
No, no, I got fired.

PETER
What happened?

JOANNA
I flipped off my boss. And some customers - actually a line just 
happened to be standing there, so...

PETER
I'm going to go away for awhile. Uh, to jail. Yea, about that computer 
scam, you were rightit was a bad idea. I'm going to take the blame for 
it, I decided. I'm going to return the money and leave the confession 
under Lumbergh's door. Joanna, I wanna apologize. I had no right to get 
pissed off at you, Lumbergh isn't my problem. It wasn't even the right 
Lumbergh. I don't know why I can't just go to work and be happy, like 
I'm supposed to like everybody else.

JOANNA
Peter, most people don't like their jobs. But you go out there and find 
something that makes you happy.

PETER
Yeah. I may never be happy with my job. But if I could be with you, I 
think that I could be happy with my life. But if you could give it 
another shot, I promise, Joanna -

JOANNA
Oh shut up.

They hug and kiss.

BRIAN
Hey, what's going on here? Get a room you two!

He makes an annoying noise and gives them the finger.

JOANNA
I hate that guy.

[Scene Initech. Peter drives up.]

Cut to inside. Peter sticks the envelope under the door of William 
Lumbergh, Division Vice President. He walks away but frantically runs 
back and tries to get the envelope. He can't reach it and finally gives 
up.

[Scene Initech. Morning. Milton is talking to an secretary. Lumbergh 
hasn't gotten to work yet.]

MILTON
...to Mr. Lumbergh and he told me to talk to Payroll and then Payroll, 
they told me to talk to Mr. Lumbergh. And I still haven't gotten my 
paycheck and they stole my stapler and they told me to move my desk to 
Storage Room B and there was garbage all over it and I don't appreciate 
that.

SECRETARY
Um, why don't you go and sit at your desk. Mr. Lumbergh should be here 
any minute.

MILTON
Mr. Lumbergh -

SECRETARY
Just go and sit at your desk.

MILTON
But -

SECRETARY
Oh?

MILTON
Ok, I, I, I'm going to set the building on fire. I tell him, if I don't 
get my stapler (the secretary leaves) I'm going to have to get my 
stapler back because it is my stapler. (he goes into Mr. Lumbergh's 
office) It's my stapler, the Swingline. It's been mine for a very long 
time.

[Scene Peter's room. He's packing his clothes. He goes outside and 
knocks on Lawrence's door.]

PETER
Hey, Lawrence, are you there?

LAWRENCE
Hey, Peter, man.

PETER
Hey. So, I may be going away for awhile.

LAWRENCE
Yeah, I know, man. It's a bummer, dude, what can I say?

PETER
Yeah. Well, it's time to go face the music. You take care of yourself, 
cause I don't wanna see ya.

They shake hands.

LAWRENCE
You too, man. Take care. (Peter starts to leave) Hey Peter! Watch out 
for the corn hole ok?

PETER
Ok, Lawrence.

[Scene Peter's car. He's driving along when he sees something.]

Cut to Initech. It's on fire, big time. Peter joins the crowd of his 
co-workers and watches. Milton walks away quickly. A structure falls 
and Peter laughs.

Cut to inside, a burning cubicle.

[Scene The burned ruins of Initech. Peter is now a construction worker, 
working alongside Lawrence. Lawrence digs up Milton's burnt Swingline.]

PETER
Let me see this.

LAWRENCE
Who would want that stapler, man? That's toasted, man.

PETER
I know someone who might want this.

A car horn beeps. Michael and Samir step out of the car.

MICHAEL
Hey man! Wanna go out to lunch?

PETER
I brought mine in a pail. Plus, Joanna's supposed to come by later.

SAMIR
So, how do you like your new job?

PETER
It's not too bad. Not too bad. How's Penetrode?

MICHAEL
Initrode.

PETER
Initrode.

SAMIR
It's work.

PETER
Yeah. Yeah.

MICHAEL
I could probably get you a job if you want.

PETER
No, thanks. I'm doing good here.

MICHAEL
So, uh, we're gonna be ok, right?

PETER
Yeah. I think the fire pretty much took care of everything.

SAMIR
But what if the money burned up? It's too be a scheme.

PETER
Yeah...

SAMIR
Are you sure you don't want us to get you a job?

PETER
That's the one thing I'm definitely sure of.

MICHAEL
All right, G.

PETER
You guys take care!

SAMIR
Ok.

MICHAEL
Stay in touch, man!

PETER
Ok, will do. (They get in the car and leave) This isn't so bad, huh? 
Making bucks, getting exercise, working outside.

LAWRENCE
Fuckin' A.

PETER
Fuckin' A...

[Scene

A beach. Milton is relaxing and a waiter comes up to him.]

MILTON
Excuse me. Excuse me, Senor. May I speak to you please? I asked for a 
mai tai, a margarita, and a pina colada. I asked for no salt, no salt 
in the margarita. But it had salt in it. (the waiter leaves) If you do 
that again, I won't be leaving a tip. I won't be putting one down. Sir? 
I could check into a competing resort...

          EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

          Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47

          The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A
          light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small
          dog and a young girl emerge.

                         GIRL
          Go on now Paul, don't be long.

          The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch.
          The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing
          the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low
          humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow
          reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers
          Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground,
          bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange
          glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness.

                         GIRL
          Paul... Paul?
          The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow.

                         GIRL
          Paul?!
          The glow fades again.
          MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble" by Paul Simon.

                         TITLE: PAUL

          EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY

          GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the
          blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM
          is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy
          hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears
          a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His
          hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid.
          Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps.
          As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the
          road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their
          way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is
          brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight,
          the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of
          the blade. He nods appreciatively.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          2.

                         CLIVE
          Beautiful piece.

                         VENDER
          Damn straight. Practical
          performance. 100% Japanese, folded
          steel. Real hero shit.

                         CLIVE
          How much?

                         VENDER

          $1,349.99.
          CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away.

                         GRAHAM
          Aren't you gonna get it?

                         CLIVE
          No, it's rubbish.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

          We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor,
          passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a
          line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN.

                         GRAHAM
          What are you going to ask?

                         CLIVE
          Do you feel that the killing of
          Hicks and Newt in Alien 3,
          invalidates Ripley's struggle at
          the closed of the previous
          installment?

                         GRAHAM
          I was going to ask that!

                         CLIVE

                         (IN KLINGON)
          Tough tits four eyes.

                         SECURITY
          Alright, next!
          Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing
          pictures. He is pleasant, if business like.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Hey there. Who's it to?

                         GRAHAM
          Graham.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Uh... are you... did you?

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          There you go.
          SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Hey there. Who's it to?

                         CLIVE
          Clive.

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          Clive.

                         CLIVE
          Uh... are you... did you?

                         MICHAEL BIEHN
          There you go.
          SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera.

                         CLIVE
          I... I need to photograph him.

                         SECURITY
          You can take it from there.
          CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position
          themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes
          the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with
          MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move
          off, looking at their spoils.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE

                         (HIGH FIVING)

          YES!

                         GRAHAM
          That was amazing. I was actually a
          bit nervous.

                         CLIVE
          Really? I wasn't.

                         GRAHAM
          Good egg, wasn't he?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, very unaffected. Damn, I
          forgot to give him my card.
          CLIVE points at SECURITY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         GRAHAM
          Give it to Colossus.

                         CLIVE
          Nah. Hey, Rosario Dawson's here!

                         GRAHAM
          She NEEDS to call me.

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE sit at a table fiddling nervously with pens.
          On either side of them are stacks of their new book; JELVA -
          ALIEN QUEEN OF THE VARVAK. A banner hangs behind, displaying
          the tome's cover, a muscular green woman in a gold bikini
          rides a blue rhino. She lashes at the beast with a laser
          whip. She has three tits. A lanky publicist paces up and
          down, making sure everything is in order.

                         PUBLICIST
          Looks good, right?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, it's very impressive.

                         PUBLICIST
          It really does the image justice. I
          never noticed the third tit.

                         CLIVE
          That was Graham's idea.

                         PUBLICIST
          Ladies man, huh? You guys happy?
          You got enough pens? You wanna
          Snapple? You wanna a Diet Coke?

                         CLIVE
          I'll have a fat Coke please?

                         PUBLICIST
          A fat what?

                         CLIVE
          Coke.

                         PUBLICIST
          Oh you man a FAT Coke.

                         CLIVE
          A what?

                         PUBLICIST
          Fat coke.

                         CLIVE
          Yes please.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         GRAHAM
          When do we start?

                         PUBLICIST
          Ten minutes ago.

                         CLIVE
          Why is it so quiet?

                         PUBLICIST
          Sylar's doing a Q and A in the main
          pavillion.

                         CLIVE
          Oh man! I wanted to go to that . I
          wanted to find out if he actually
          eats the brains.

                         PUBLICIST
          I can make a call.

                         CLIVE
          Please.

                         PUBLICIST
          It'll pick up when he's done.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm nervous.

                         CLIVE
          Don't be. The hard work's done, we
          have a great story and as usual
          your renderings jump from the page.

                         PUBLICIST
          Yeah man. Three tits. Awesome.

                         GRAHAM
          Thank you.

                         CLIVE
          All we have to do now is sit back
          and enjoy.
          A child approaches.

                         CLIVE
          Queen Jelva welcomes thee.

                         CHILD
          Do you know where Sylar's on?

                         CLIVE
          Main pavillion.

                         CHILD
          Thanks. Hey, three tits. Awesome.

          Caption: 50 MINUTES LATER
          They are sat in exactly the same position as before. CLIVE
          looks a little downbeat, GRAHAM fidgets with his pens.

                         PUBLICIST
          Okay, that's the hour. How'd we do?

                         CLIVE
          Three copies.

                         PUBLICIST
          Hey, one for each tit. Maybe you
          should have given her four.

                         GRAHAM
          That's sick.

                         PUBLICIST
          Don't sweat it. It's a sleeper.

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, but three copies?

                         PUBLICIST
          Better than Carl Weathers.

                         CLIVE

          YES!

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a copy?

                         PUBLICIST
          Are you nuts? My office is full of
          junk.
          The PUBLICIST walks away chuckling.

                         CLIVE
          Graham, I need a drink.

          INT. HOTEL. BAR - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are stood against the wall in a bar. GRAHAM
          drinks and elaborate blue cocktail through a straw. CLIVE
          sips from a Jack Daniels and Coke. Everyone else in the bar
          is dressed as a HOBBIT. CLIVE winks at a girl.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

          INT. HOTEL. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE's hotel room is filled with bags of stuff
          from the convention, a laptop computer and a games console
          plugged into the TV. GRAHAM lies on his bed. He is looking at
          a map. Other maps are scattered about.

          CLIVE (O.S.)
          It was like the Prancing Pony in
          there.

                         GRAHAM
          Nasty Hobbitses.
          CLIVE emerges from the bathroom. He is naked but for a black
          towel wrapped around his waist. His hair is wet and suddenly
          incredibly long. Around his neck, a large animal tooth hangs
          on a black leather cord.

                         CLIVE
          They think they're so cool.

                         GRAHAM
          Hey, are you excited about going to
          Area 51?

                         CLIVE
          Hell yes.

                         GRAHAM
          06.30 check out?

                         CLIVE
          A-ffirmative.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE both look at their watches.

                         CLIVE
          Three, two, one...

                         GRAHAM CLIVE
          Beep. Beep.

                         CLIVE
          Good night, Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Good night, Clive.
          They switch off their respective bedside lights. The room is
          plunged into pitch darkness. A few seconds pass.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you asleep?

                         CLIVE
          No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         GRAHAM
          Shall we try and storm the Citadel
          before we nod off?

                         CLIVE
          Couldn't hurt could it?
          We hear some movement then the room is illuminated by the TV.
          The boys lie on their beds holding games controllers.

                         CLIVE
          Cover me.

          INT. HOTEL. RECEPTION - MORNING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE stand at reception. Both look extremely
          sleepy. CLIVE's eyes close. GRAHAM lolls forward onto the
          reception desk. His head hits the bell.

          DING!

          EXT. HOTEL - MORNING

          The boys stand, waiting for their transport. We see them from
          across the road. A tiny old car splutters up to the curb. A
          valet gets out and hands the keys to CLIVE.

                         VALET
          There you go.

                         GRAHAM
          That's not ours.

                         VALET
          No?

                         CLIVE
          No, that's ours.
          A large RV pulls up. A 1985 Holiday Rambler, Imperial. Top of
          the range in its day. Still looks good.

                         VALET
          Oh.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE run off toward the RV. The four BORG from
          the previous day approach the VALET and exchange the key to
          the car for some small change. The BORG drive off.

                         VALET
          Fucking Borg.
          (giving the finger)
          Assimilate this!
          The RV speeds past the disgruntled VALET. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          can be heard whooping within.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

          INT. RV - MORNING

          CLIVE is seated behind the wheel of their RV, he now wears
          black wrap-around shades. In the back of the RV, GRAHAM
          fusses with maps and provisions.

                         GRAHAM
          Breakfast?

                         CLIVE
          Java. Straight up.

                         GRAHAM
          Any solids?

                         CLIVE
          No, let's punch through. Miles make
          the eggs taste sweeter.

                         GRAHAM
          I love eggs!

                         CLIVE
          I hear that. Now, get that "Joe' on
          the go and jump in the Chewie seat.
          I need your map skills.

                         GRAHAM
          Good job I pre-pared.
          GRAHAM flicks on the coffee and jumps into the co-pilot's
          (Chewie) seat.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a shame I don't have some
          controls on this side. That way, I
          could take over if you needed the
          loo.

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, I could say "take the helm."

                         GRAHAM
          "Take the helm, number one."

                         CLIVE
          Yeah, "take the helm, number one, I
          need a number two."
          They laugh heartily. Through this, GRAHAM has been taking out
          his laptop and setting it up on the dash board.

                         GRAHAM
          "Least I've got Cerebro, eh?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         CLIVE
          Absolutely. Real-time sat-nav multi
          map and advanced geo-tagging with
          continual info stream?

                         GRAHAM
          Impressive.

                         CLIVE
          Most impressive.

                         GRAHAM
          And let's not forget, we've always
          got Analogue.
          GRAHAM pulls a map down. Obscuring the entire windshield.

                         CLIVE
          Not when we're driving Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.
          GRAHAM sends the map back up into the roller. The coffee
          percolator gurgles in the galley.

                         GRAHAM
          Sounds like coffee o'clock.

                         CLIVE
          Thank god. I'm a wreck until I've
          had my first cup of J.
          GRAHAM high fives CLIVE and heads back into the kitchen.

          INT. DINER - DAY

          GRAHAM and CLIVE eat lunch. GRAHAM has finished a plate of
          prawns. He inspects the shells.

                         GRAHAM
          Looks like a pile of dead droids.
          A perky waitress approaches. GRAHAM and CLIVE become shy and
          awkward.

                         WAITRESS
          You boys all set? Can I get you
          anything else?
          GRAHAM spills his drink. CLIVE appears very uneasy.

          INT/EXT. RV - DAY

          They drive in silence, surveying the landscape.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         CLIVE
          Amazing, isn't it? There are
          295,734,134 people in this country
          and we haven't seen a soul for a
          hundred miles. Where is everybody?

                         GRAHAM
          What about that old woman on
          crutches we saw hitchhiking?

                         CLIVE
          Apart from her. I suppose that's
          why they established the Dreamland
          facility out here.

                         GRAHAM
          Far from prying eyes.

                         CLIVE
          Did you know the site was selected
          in the mid-1950s for testing of the
          U-2 spyplane, due to its
          remoteness, proximity to existing
          facilities and presence of a dry
          lake bad for landings?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         CLIVE
          Oh.

                         GRAHAM
          Shall we have a bite before or
          after we hit the Black Mailbox?

                         CLIVE
          Before.

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE tuck into burgers. They are the only
          customers. The interior is replete with various Area 51
          related memorabilia. PAT, (female, 50s) the proprietor,
          speaks to them from behind the counter. She holds up two
          bumper stickers.

                         PAT
          "Watch The Skies" or "Alien
          Onboard?"
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other for a few seconds before
          looking back at PAT.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          "Alien Onboard."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         PAT
          Nice choice. So, where have you
          boys come from?

                         GRAHAM

                         (MUMBLY)
          San Diego.

                         PAT
          Comic-Con?

                         CLIVE
          How could you tell?
          We see GRAHAM and CLIVE looking back at PAT. They look like
          the most painfully obvious Comic-Con attendees ever.

                         PAT
          Just a guess. My nephew launched a
          comic down there a couple of years
          ago. Sort of dramatized the
          accounts of some of the folk we've
          had in here.

                         CLIVE
          Encounter Briefs?

                         PAT
          That's it. You heard of it, huh?

                         CLIVE
          I've got all six.

                         PAT
          Well whaddya know? Small world.

                         CLIVE
          Do you get a lot of UFO types round
          here?
          We see PAT looking back at CLIVE, surrounded by UFO and alien
          paraphernalia, a slight smile on her face.

                         PAT
          Some.

                         GRAHAM
          Have you ever seen one?

                         PAT
          A UFO? Oh, I've seen plenty.

                         GRAHAM
          Really?! You've seen more than one
          UFOs?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         PAT
          Well, I don't know what they were.
          So as far as I'm concerned they're
          unidentified and they were
          definitely flying.

                         CLIVE
          And objects.

                         PAT
          Damn straight. Whether or not they
          were spaceships, I can't say.
          Probably not, but I'd like to think
          they were. Be a shame if we were
          the only souls in the universe.

                         CLIVE
          Did you now, it's estimated that
          there are as many as 200 billion
          galaxies in the observable universe
          and each of those has approximately
          40 billion starts, around which
          orbit countless planets and moons?

                         PAT
          Yes.

                         CLIVE
          Oh.

                         PAT
          Makes you think though, don't it?

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAT
          Where is everybody?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE ponder this.

                         PAT
          You boys all set?

                         CLIVE
          I'd like a cup of coffee please.

                         PAT
          Sure thing. How about you, sugar?

                         GRAHAM
          Can I have an E.T. malt please?

                         PAT
          You wanna sparkler in that?
          GRAHAM smiles coyly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

                         PAT
          I'll take that as a yes.
          She beams at the boys and disappears into the kitchen. GRAHAM
          and CLIVE are left alone. They take it all in.

                         CLIVE
          It's nice here, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          Absolutely.

                         CLIVE
          I think I might use the loo.
          CLIVE walks through a door marked "Maliens'. The adjacent
          toilet door (GUS and JAKE) enter. GRAHAM becomes uneasy.

                         PAT
          Yes dear, what can I get you?

                         JAKE
          Two beers.

                         PAT
          Coming right up.

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. TOILET - EVENING

          CLIVE washes his hands. He pumps soap from a dispenser which
          is shaped like an alien's head, the soap squirts out of its
          mouth. CLIVE is quite taken with this.

                         CLIVE
          That is absolutely amazing!

          INT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN. BAR - EVENING

          CLIVE appears out of the toilet with his hands in the air.

                         CLIVE
          Hey Graham, an alien just sicked up
          into my palms.
          CLIVE doesn't see the two men sat up at the counter. He
          strides over to GRAHAM, full of excitement.

                         CLIVE
          I'm joking, of course. They have a
          soap dispenser, shaped like an
          alien's head. When you pump his
          jaw, soap comes out of his mouth.

                         GRAHAM

                         (MUMBLING)
          Clive...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         CLIVE
          It's hilarious.
          GRAHAM flicks his eyes to the counter.

                         CLIVE
          What?
          CLIVE looks over and sees the two men. They are glaring back.
          CLIVE immediately loses his confident air.

          PAT (O.S.)
          Here it comes!
          GRAHAM closes his yes, remembering what he ordered. The two
          men turn to see PAT emerge from the kitchen with a tray of
          drinks. Two bottles of beer, one cup of coffee and an absurd
          looking milkshake in a tall glass with a sparkler.

                         PAT
          Okay then, beers for you gentleman.
          A cup of Joe and a extra thick malt
          with a sparkler for the boys from
          outer space.
          The man snigger derisively. PAT senses the tension.

                         PAT
          So, where you boys headed?

                         JAKE
          We're heading into Utah. Do
          ourselves some hunting.

                         GUS
          Deer, coon, beaver, whatever steps
          in front of the bangstick, right
          Jake?
          They throw a look back at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         JAKE
          You got that right, Gus.

                         PAT
          Well now, I heard Utah beaver puts
          up quite a fight.

                         GUS
          That's what we're counting on.
          They nudge each other and laugh.

                         PAT
          I better make you something good
          and hot. Long way to The Beehive.
          PAT give GRAHAM and CLIVE a look. CLIVE understands and
          fumbles for hi wallet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.
          He places a number of bills on the table. They leave. GRAHAM
          comes back in and retrieves the bumper sticker. PAT gives him
          a wink. He leaves.

          INT/EXT. RV - EVENING

          GRAHAM boards the RV. CLIVE is in the driver's seat. The
          engine is running.

                         CLIVE
          What took you so long?

                         GRAHAM
          I was putting the sticker on.

                         CLIVE
          They were an odd pair, weren't
          they?

                         GRAHAM
          Definitely didn't speak Bocci.
          CLIVE fires up the engine and jams it into reverse. CRUNCH.

          GRAHAM (CONT'D)
          That wasn't their truck was it?

                         CLIVE
          No.

          EXT. THE LITTLE A'LE'INN - EVENING

          The RV roars off, leaving the car park and the black Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM looks at a map. CLIVE drives, continually checking his
          rear view.

                         GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                         CLIVE
          Nothing. How we doing?

                         GRAHAM
          We should be just about there.
          They scan the roadside for a few seconds.

                         CLIVE
          I've found it.

                         GRAHAM
          Where?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         CLIVE

          THERE!!!

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          The RV comes to a screeching halt. It sits in the road for a
          moment, before it trundles onto the hard shoulder. The door
          opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE appear wearing head mounted torches.
          They wander over to a WHITE mailbox.

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE

                         (REVERENTIALLY)
          The Black Mailbox.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE marvel at it. The silence of the night and
          the size of the landscape dawns on them. They look up.

                         CLIVE
          It's amazing, isn't it? We're
          actually here.

                         GRAHAM
          Area 51.

                         CLIVE
          Dreamland.

                         GRAHAM
          The Groom Lake Military Test
          Facility.

                         CLIVE
          MacArthur's Black Mile.

                         GRAHAM
          Is that a real one?

                         CLIVE
          No, I made it up myself.

                         GRAHAM
          I like it.

                         CLIVE
          Be great if we saw something.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by
          a craft.

                         CLIVE
          That would be incredible. It just
          sort of stops in the air and hovers
          then just goes up really fast.
          Whoosh.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         GRAHAM
          What would you do if they actually
          landed?

                         CLIVE
          Keep it together. First contact is
          a big responsibility. They come in
          peace, we go to pieces? That's not
          how I roll.
          CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed.

                         CLIVE
          What's wrong?
          GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS.

                         GRAHAM
          It's them. They found us. I don't
          know how but they found us.

                         CLIVE
          Who? Who's found us?

                         GRAHAM
          The Libyans!

                         CLIVE
          Run for it Marty!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the
          RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently.

                         GRAHAM
          Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps
          whoever it was turned doff.

                         CLIVE
          Of course it's them. We're dead.
          It's like Deliverance. They're
          going to rape us and break our
          arms.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't want my arms broken!

                         CLIVE
          There's only one thing for it.

                         GRAHAM
          What?

                         CLIVE
          I'm gonna have to fly blind.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.
          CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness,
          still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on.

                         CLIVE
          Probably best not to do that. I
          couldn't really see anything.
          They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of
          the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible.

                         CLIVE
          Oh God, oh God, oh God.

                         GRAHAM
          I need the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Me too.
          The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake.

                         CLIVE
          They're trying to overtake.

                         GRAHAM
          Don't let them get past.

                         CLIVE
          Should I ram them?

                         GRAHAM
          What about the deposit?
          CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A
          BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to
          avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes
          widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times,
          bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on
          its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks.

                         CLIVE
          It wasn't them.
          The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE peer out of the window.

                         CLIVE
          We should see if they're okay.

                         GRAHAM
          I still need a wee.

                         CLIVE
          I can hold mine.
          GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE
          remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled
          Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         GRAHAM
          The bulb's gone in there.

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car.
          Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open.

                         CLIVE
          Hello?
          They wait for a few seconds. Nothing.

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe you should call for help.
          GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          I wouldn't do that if I were you.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure
          sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a
          cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large,
          black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp.

                         CLIVE
          I rather think these men need help.
          Graham, give me the phone.
          GRAHAM passes the phone over.

                         VOICE
          Seriously, I wouldn't do that.
          GRAHAM's mouth falls open, CLIVE continues to hold the phone
          to his ear. We hear the operator.

                         OPERATOR
          911 Emergency. How may I direct
          your call? Hello? Hello?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE continue to gawp. The shape stand and steps
          into the light. GRAHAM and CLIVE go slack. Standing in front
          of them, clad only in cut-off short and flip-flops... is an

          ALIEN.

                         ALIEN
          Put - the phone - down.
          Without the slightest change of expression CLIVE rocks
          backwards in a dead faint. He hits the ground with a bump.
          GRAHAM looks at CLIVE then back at the ALIEN. When GRAHAM
          speaks his voice quivers with hysterical panic.

                         GRAHAM
          What have you done to him?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         ALIEN
          I didn't do anything. He fainted.

                         GRAHAM
          Yes but you made him faint.

                         ALIEN
          I did not. Okay I did, but it's not
          like i set my phaser to "Faint'.

                         GRAHAM
          You've got a phaser!?

                         ALIEN
          No! Look, I need you to help. Can
          you get this guy back onto your
          wagon?

                         GRAHAM
          Are you going to probe us?

                         ALIEN
          No! Where does that come from? Why
          do people always assume we want to
          stick something up their ass?

                         GRAHAM
          Don't you?

                         ALIEN
          No. There's certainly nothing about
          it in the encounter manual. As a
          rule, we don't even abduct. Maybe
          people find it easier to deal with
          earthly transgressions if they
          suppress it with absurd fantasies
          about alien probing.

                         GRAHAM
          What?

                         ALIEN
          It's just a theory. Listen, focus
          okay? I promise you I won't hurt
          you, I just need your help.

                         GRAHAM
          You need my help?

                         ALIEN
          Yes.

                         GRAHAM
          How come I can understand you? Are
          you using some sort of neural
          language router?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         ALIEN
          No, I'm speaking English you prick.
          (off GRAHAM's expression)
          Sorry, I'm tense. Look, what's your
          name?

                         GRAHAM
          Graham Willy.

                         ALIEN
          What about him?

                         GRAHAM
          That's the writer, Clive Gollings.

                         ALIEN
          Well, let's get Clive into the RV
          and get going. I'll explain
          everything on the way. Please.

                         GRAHAM
          Where are we going?

                         ALIEN
          North.

                         GRAHAM
          The RV's gotta be back in 2 days.

                         ALIEN
          Well, then we're gonna have to
          hustle, aren't we?

                         GRAHAM

                         BUT-

                         ALIEN
          Look Graham, you're just gonna have
          to trust me, okay?
          GRAHAM looks at the ALIEN. It stands at roughly 3 feet tall.
          His black almond shaped eye glint. His large head tilts to
          one side, his small mouth opens slightly, his long fingers
          clasp together, pleading.

                         ALIEN
          Please man, I need you.
          GRAHAM considers the ALIEN for a moment.

                         GRAHAM
          Okay then.

                         ALIEN
          Great. Thank you.

                         GRAHAM
          What's your name?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         ALIEN
          I'm Paul.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Now let's get Cloverfield
          onto the recreational vehicle and
          get the fuck off MacArthur's Black
          Mile.
          They attempt to move CLIVE. PAUL senses something.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Oh man, has he...?

                         GRAHAM
          I told him he should have gone.

                         PAUL
          Could have been worse. Know what
          I'm saying?
          They drag him into the RV. The door shuts, a few seconds
          later, GRAHAM appears and runs round to the back of the RV.
          He rips the bumper sticker off and gets back on board. The RV
          starts up and drives off.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of
          times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge.

                         PAUL
          Can I have this ham?

                         GRAHAM
          Uh... yes.

                         PAUL
          Great!
          PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth,
          wolfing it down hungrily.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul? Where am I going again?

                         PAUL
          I told you, North. Do you have a
          map?
          GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield.

                         PAUL
          Not when we're driving, Graham.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          The map disappears back up into the roller.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.

                         PAUL
          Just head North. We need to get as
          much distance as we can between us
          and them.

                         GRAHAM
          Them? Who's them?

          EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a
          dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited
          man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first.
          The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and
          pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his
          mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time.
          Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A
          SOLDIER approaches.

                         CAPTAIN
          Sir?

                         ZOIL
          Talk to me.

                         CAPTAIN
          Three survivors, company men, hurt
          but alive.

                         ZOIL
          Anyone else?

                         CAPTAIN
          No sir.
          ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air.

                         CAPTAIN
          What's this?
          The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet.
          ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger.

                         CAPTAIN
          What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas?

                         ZOIL
          No. It's neither of those things.
          He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the
          side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to
          his car and hits a button on the dash.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          25.

                         VOICE
          What's the situation?

                         ZOIL
          We have a guest who's left the
          hotel without paying, sir.

                         VOICE
          Damn it! Do you think he's "left'
          left?

                         ZOIL
          Doubtful. NORAD would have picked
          up a bogie. Those guys can track
          Santa. No sir, he's still here.
          Question is, for how long?

                         VOICE
          Don't you think this is all a bit
          of a coincidence?

                         ZOIL
          How so?

                         VOICE
          I signed the red document this
          morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's
          odd that he chooses today to go
          AWOL? How did he know?

                         ZOIL
          Are you suggesting he has someone
          on the inside.

                         VOICE
          Maybe.

                         ZOIL
          Well he's definitely got someone on
          the outside.

                         VOICE
          What?

                         ZOIL
          Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks...
          among other things. I'd bet my left
          nut that little bastard's hitched a
          ride.

                         VOICE
          Lock down the area. Road blocks,
          spot checks, the whole nine yards.
          You're going to handle this
          personally, Zoil. I want this
          wrapped up before Letterman.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER

          Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV.
          Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear
          the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He
          notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to
          see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the
          bathroom door. The toilet flushes.
          CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of
          skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk.

                         PAUL
          The bulb's gone in there.
          CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his
          middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives,
          PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios.

                         PAUL
          I hate it when you get the closed
          ones, right?

                         GRAHAM
          I usually bite them open.

                         PAUL
          Are you fucking insane? You gotta
          tap "em and if they don't open you
          throw them away.

                         GRAHAM
          That's molluscs.

                         PAUL
          Shut up.

                         GRAHAM
          It's true.

                         (NOTICES CLIVE)
          Hello Clive! How are you feeling?

                         CLIVE
          I'm feeling like I've gone MENTAL
          MAD, Graham. If that is your name?
          You're happily sitting there
          chatting to... to... that, like
          it's the most natural thing in the
          world. The two of you laughing away
          like you haven't seen each other
          since 1990.
          PAUL spits a shell out into a cup.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

          CLIVE (CONT'D)
          So forgive me if I seem a little
          rattled but from where I'm standing
          it would appear you are trading nut
          knowledge with an alien life form.

                         GRAHAM
          His name is Paul.

                         CLIVE
          Oh, Paul is it? Paul what? Paul
          Verhoven? Paul Freeman? Paul
          Reiser?

                         PAUL
          Just Paul. You know, like Madonna
          or Dracula.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul's from a small planet in the
          northern spiral arm of the
          Andromeda Galaxy.

                         CLIVE
          No he is not!

                         PAUL
          I am man, seriously.

                         CLIVE
          How could he possibly have
          travelled that distance?

                         PAUL
          Wormhole.

                         CLIVE
          Balls! Graham, this isn't what it
          seems. What about Ocham's Razor?

                         GRAHAM
          The hairdressers?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, the old man who owns it told
          me that, in unbelievable
          circumstances, the most plausible
          explanation is usually the truth.

                         PAUL
          And what's the most plausible
          explanation, Clive?

                         CLIVE
          That you're a thin midget in an
          alien costume.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.

                         PAUL
          There's no such thing as a thin
          midget? Those guys are built. Have
          you not seen The Station Agent?

                         GRAHAM
          He's right. I think that's less
          believable than Paul being form a
          planet in the norther spiral arm of
          the Andromeda Galaxy.

          CLIVE (CONT'D)
          Oh really?
          With this CLIVE grabs at PAUL. He pulls at the alien's skin,
          trying to gain a hold of a mask.

                         PAUL
          Ow! Get off me!

                         CLIVE
          You're not real. You're not real!

                         GRAHAM
          Excuse me.

                         PAUL
          Get off me, you fucking psycho!

                         GRAHAM

          EXCUSE ME!
          CLIVE releases PAUL and looks out of the RV to see the
          flashing lights of a road block. GRAHAM slows down.

                         CLIVE
          Oh shit!
          CLIVE looks round to discover that PAUL has vanished. GRAHAM
          pulls the RV onto the hard shoulder.

                         CLIVE
          Where's he gone?

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe he beamed up.

                         CLIVE
          As if. We would have seen the
          classic shimmer and hum.

                         GRAHAM
          Good point.

          BANG, BANG, BANG!
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look to the door. Both terrified.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE stand outside the RV being questioned by an
          AGENT dressed like ZOIL. We can hear noise and activity from
          the RV. Another AGENT is aboard the RV.

                         AGENT 1
          Where you boys from? Australia?

                         CLIVE
          Britain.

                         AGENT 1
          Ah. G'day mate.
          The AGENT smiles. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terrified.

                         AGENT 1
          Whatcha doin' in the US fellas?

                         CLIVE/GRAHAM
          Comic-con.

                         AGENT 1
          You're a long way from San Diego.

                         CLIVE
          We were having a little drive.

                         AGENT 1
          Is that right?

          AGENT 2 (O.S.)
          Hey Haggard?!

                         HAGGARD
          Yeah?
          O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph.

                         O'REILLY
          These guys have met Michael Biehn.

                         HAGGARD
          No shit! How was he?

                         CLIVE
          He was a good egg.

                         GRAHAM
          Very unaffected.

                         HAGGARD
          That's nice to hear.

                         (TO AGENT 2)
          O'Reilly? Anything else?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

                         O'REILLY
          Just some pissy jeans.
          HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits.
          CLIVE look embarrassed.

                         HAGGARD
          Okay, you guys can go.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you. May I ask what you're
          searching for?

                         HAGGARD
          Of course you may.
          There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV.

          INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused
          and shaken.

                         CLIVE
          Well, it's pretty obvious what
          happened there, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          Is it?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, the government used some sort
          of neurotoxic paint on the Black
          Mailbox, which was white by the
          way, and it caused us to suffer a
          shared hallucination about an
          alien. I mean, it's what we've
          always wanted, isn't it?

                         GRAHAM
          I suppose so.

                         CLIVE
          Than that's what happened.
          PAUL materializes from thin air behind them.

                         PAUL

          WRONG!

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT

          The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two
          AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the
          distance before righting itself and continuing on its way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

          INT. RV - NIGHT


                         CLIVE
          Where the hell did you go?

                         PAUL
          Nowhere.

                         GRAHAM
          What, you went invisible?

                         PAUL
          It's not invisibility per so. It's
          more like what a chameleon does
          with a little light blending thrown
          in for good measure.

                         GRAHAM
          Like Predator?

                         PAUL
          Exactly.

                         GRAHAM
          Can you do it whenever you want?

                         PAUL

                         (PREDATOR VOICE)
          Anytime...

          EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

          We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road
          into the night.

          INT. RV - DAYBREAK

          CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat
          eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes
          on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut.

                         CLIVE
          No thank you.

                         PAUL
          You sure? How about a cup of
          coffee?
          (sees he's tempted)
          Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice
          cuppa J.
          PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as
          he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start.

                         PAUL
          Hey, look who's up!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         GRAHAM
          Hello Paul.
          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him.

                         GRAHAM
          What's the matter?

                         CLIVE
          Graham, there is a Grey in the
          galley, making me coffee.

                         GRAHAM
          Did you want tea?

                         CLIVE
          No, I don't want tea.

                         GRAHAM
          Tea's a bit weird in America, isn't
          it?

                         CLIVE
          No, what's wried, Graham, is that
          we have picked up an extra
          terrestrial hitch hiker and you
          seem completely fine with it!

                         GRAHAM
          He needs our help, Clive.
          PAUL returns with the coffee. GRAHAM and CLIVE curtail their
          conversation. PAUL hand CLIVE his coffee.

                         PAUL CLIVE
          You got it? Yes I've got it.

                         PAUL CLIVE
          It's hot. (slightly testy)
          Thank you.
          GRAHAM looks at Paul and nods toward CLIVE. PAUL sighs and
          sits in the Chewie seat. GRAHAM hangs back...

                         PAUL
          Look Clive, I'm gonna go out on a
          limb and say this is probably the
          weirdest thing that's ever happened
          to you. Am i right?
          CLIVE doesn't deny it.

                         PAUL
          And I appreciate the fact that I
          have somewhat gate-crashed the
          party here but, truth be told, I'm
          in a hell of a pickle. I really
          need your help.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         CLIVE
          Why us?

                         PAUL
          Why not?
          CLIVE glances back at an expectant GRAHAM.

                         CLIVE
          What about the RV? It has to be
          back in two days.

                         GRAHAM
          Clive, he's an alien. A living,
          breathing, alien.
          CLIVE look at PAUL who makes a sad face and does the hand
          gesture from Close Encounters. CLIVE wilts.

                         CLIVE
          I suppose we could phone the hire
          company and get an extension.
          PAUL looks super-pleased.

                         CLIVE
          How did you get here?

                         PAUL
          Crashed in "47. Anti-grav failure.

                         GRAHAM
          Happens to the best of us.

                         PAUL
          Also, I'm a shit driver.

                         CLIVE
          Oh my God! Roswell?! That was you?!

                         PAUL
          Roswell was a smoke-screen man,
          designed to distract from the
          truth.

                         CLIVE
          They invented a fake alien crash to
          distract from an actual alien
          crash?

                         PAUL
          I know, fucking stupid, isn't it?

                         CLIVE
          What have you been doing here all
          this time?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         PAUL
          Oh you know, kickin' back, shooting
          the shit. Advising the government.

                         GRAHAM
          Not just the government.

          INT. ROOM - DAY


                         CAPTION: 1980
          A room lit by a single bulb, furnished with a table and
          chair. PAUL sits with his back to us, he is smoking a
          cigarette, whilst talking on the phone. We hear the voice on
          the other end of the line. It is strangely familiar.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          ...I want him to have some kind of
          special power, you know? Something
          sort of messianic...

                         PAUL
          How about molecular revivification.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          I don't know what that is.

                         PAUL
          Restoration of damaged tissue
          through telepathic manipulation of
          cellular intrinsic field memory.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          I...uh...

                         PAUL
          Healing, Steven.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          Oh right yeah. Like by touch sort
          of thing? His little finger could
          light up at the end and-

                         PAUL
          You know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The line beeps.

                         STEVEN SPIELBERG
          You got another call?

                         PAUL
          Yeah I gotta take this man. It's
          the fucking V guys again.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         PAUL
          Right.

                         GRAHAM
          You'd be surprised how much he's
          influenced popular culture
          generally over the last 60 years.

                         CLIVE

                         (TO GRAHAM)
          How come you know so much?

                         GRAHAM
          We had quite a long chat while you
          were unconscious.
          CLIVE looks miffed.

                         GRAHAM
          ...while you were asleep.

                         PAUL
          You want a bagel Clive?

                         CLIVE
          No thanks.

                         PAUL
          Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes please.

                         CLIVE
          Go on then, I'll have half.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          You want anything on it?

                         CLIVE
          Jam.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          What?

                         CLIVE
          Jelly.

                         PAUL
          Gotcha.
          PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence.

                         GRAHAM
          I gave your jeans a swill and hung
          them up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you. So, do you know where
          we're going?

                         GRAHAM
          Just North. He said we had to make
          a right at Utah.

                         CLIVE
          Why can't he tell us?

                         GRAHAM
          He said it was a surprise.

                         CLIVE
          Do you trust him, Graham? I mean,
          is he Strider or Black Rider?

                         GRAHAM
          Strider, definitely.

                         CLIVE
          You'd better be right. I don't want
          to wake up and find him inserting a
          probe into my anus.

                         GRAHAM
          It's okay, he doesn't do that.
          PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger.

                         PAUL
          Bagel time!
          The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air.

                         GRAHAM
          Fuel level's critical.

                         PAUL
          Sorry, I had a warning light just
          like that on my ship.

                         GRAHAM
          For fuel?

                         PAUL
          Anti-grav failure.
          CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer.

                         CLIVE
          There's a place called Ely five
          miles from here. It's small but
          there should be a gas station.

                         GRAHAM
          Roger that, number one.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.
          CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look.
          PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks".

          INT. RV - MORNING

          GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears
          deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a
          V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD
          MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves.

                         CLIVE
          Paul, don't do that!

                         PAUL
          Here's what I need. Some organic
          beef mince, organic pork, some
          veal, red onions, pine nuts,
          pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a
          fistful of fresh basil and 3 war
          ciabattas.

                         CLIVE
          You know this is a gas station?
          PAUL looks disappointed.

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

          The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the
          forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can.

                         CLIVE
          Ready?

                         GRAHAM
          Ready.
          HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Get me some more peanut M&Ms.
          GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE
          CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles
          the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout
          as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he
          tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time
          as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald.

                         STATE TROOPER
          After you.

                         CLIVE
          Thanks.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - MORNING

          Close up on O'REILLY. He covers his face with his hands.

                         O'REILLY
          Coming... ready or not!
          O'REILLY uncovers his eyes and comes face to face with ZOIL.
          ZOIL is eating an orange, he offers a segment to O'REILLY.

                         ZOIL
          Orange?

                         O'REILLY
          No thanks.

                         ZOIL
          Nice and juicy.

                         O'REILLY
          I don't want to spoil breakfast.

                         ZOIL
          Do you mind telling me what's going
          on, Agent?

                         O'REILLY
          Just keeping ourselves occupied
          sir. Things are pretty slow.

                         ZOIL
          Where's the other one?

                         O'REILLY
          I don't know, let's see. Haggard?
          HAGGARD steps out from behind the only man shaped cactus on
          the entire desert plain. O'REILLY can't help but let out a
          snort of delighted surprise. HAGGARD hurries over.

                         HAGGARD
          Sorry, I was just... hiding.

                         ZOIL
          I see. You fellas had much traffic
          through here?

                         HAGGARD
          Just a big RV driven by a couple of
          nerds.

                         ZOIL
          Nerds, huh?

                         HAGGARD
          Yeah, they'd been to Comic-Con and
          met Michael Biehn.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.

                         ZOIL
          I've heard he's nice.

                         HAGGARD
          Good egg.

                         O'REILLY
          Very unaffected.

                         ZOIL
          Did you search the vehicle
          thoroughly?

                         O'REILLY
          Yes sir.

                         ZOIL
          Find anything?

                         O'REILLY
          Not really. Just Michael Biehn's
          autograph and some pissy jeans.
          Close in on ZOIL. He seems suddenly motivated.

                         ZOIL
          Did you get the license plate?
          HAGGARD and O'REILLY look sheepish.

                         ZOIL
          Make?
          More sheepishness.

                         HAGGARD
          It was big.

                         ZOIL
          I want everything you can remember.
          Descriptions of the occupants,
          height, hair, distinguishing
          features. We can do it on the way.

                         HAGGARD
          On the way?

                         ZOIL
          You're coming with me.

                         O'REILLY
          What about the road block sir?

                         ZOIL
          It didn't work.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

          INT. GAS STATION - MORNING

          GRAHAM joins CLIVE at the check out, clutching a bag of
          jerky, a bottle of chocolate milk, a burrito, a Coke, some
          mini doughnuts and a massive bag of peanut M&Ms.

                         CLIVE
          Don't you think that's a bit much?
          Put it all back. Except the
          burrito... and the doughnuts... and
          the chocolate milk. Let's just pay
          for it and leave.

                         GRAHAM
          We need bulb for the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Essential only, Graham!
          They head to the counter. So does the STATE TROOPER.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Morning Chris!

                         CHRIS
          Hey Dean.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Who do you think I had in my office
          this morning?

                         CHRIS
          Jeremy Piven?

                         STATE TROOPER
          No. The Secret Service.
          GRAHAM bumps into a display of sunglasses and just stops it
          tumbling. CHRIS and the STATE TROOPER glance over.

                         CHRIS
          They find out how you can afford a
          Dodge Viper on troopers pay?

                         STATE TROOPER
          Not yet. They're all over this
          crash on the road up to Rachel.

                         CHRIS
          What you think's going on?

                         STATE TROOPER
          Don't know, could be Muslims.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Cheeerist!
          CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.

                         STATE TROOPER
          You go right ahead.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you very much, officer.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Where're you guys from?

                         GRAHAM
          Britain.

                         STATE TROOPER
          Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns!

                         CHRIS
          No guns? Jesus Cheeerist.
          CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER
          and CHRIS watch them go.

          EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING

          The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear
          the radio spring to life as they pass.

                         POLICE CONTROLLER
          All units, be on the lookout for a
          cream and brown Recreational
          Vehicle, no plate number at this
          time. Officers are advised to
          contain but not board. Dean, if you
          still at Gas and Go, bring back a
          quart a milk and a box of doughnut
          holes? Dean?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently.

          HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK!

          INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER

          PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM
          drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat.

                         CLIVE
          It's find for you. You'll get
          whisked back to whatever lab they
          kept you in and we'll be arrested
          for harbouring a fugitive and sent
          to Guantanamo Bay.
          PAUL laughs.

                         CLIVE
          Why's everything so funny? They
          think we're Muslims.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.

                         PAUL
          That's their excuse for everything.
          There are worse things you can be.
          We had a Muslim guy at the base.
          Systems analyst called Yusef. We
          used to do karaoke on Tuesday
          nights. You should'a heard him do
          Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get
          a chance to say salam alaikum.

                         CLIVE
          Paul, the authorities know we're in
          an TV.

                         PAUL
          We're hardly the only RV on the
          road. Trust me, if we stay off the
          highways, keep to the back routes,
          we'll have a nice uneventful
          journey.
          BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps.
          GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out.
          The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road
          lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead.

                         PAUL
          Fuck, that made me jump.

                         CLIVE
          Ah yes, the waspish markings of a
          Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable.

                         PAUL
          What a waste.

                         GRAHAM
          Poor thing.

                         CLIVE
          Nothing anyone could've done.
          PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands.

                         GRAHAM
          What are you doing?
          PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways
          slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens
          its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what
          they are seeing.

                         GRAHAM
          It's a miracle!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.
          PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch.

                         PAUL
          I'll miss these.

                         CLIVE
          Why would you do that?

                         PAUL
          I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am

          I?

          EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

          ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas
          station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS.

                         STATE TROOPER
          By the time I got the bulletin,
          they were long gone. Seemed like
          nice fellas to me.

                         CHRIS
          Is it true they was Muslims?

                         STATE TROOPER
          They said they were British.

                         ZOIL
          I think you can be both.

                         CHRIS
          Jesus Cheeeeerist!

                         HAGGARD
          Agent Zoil?

                         ZOIL
          Excuse me gentlemen.
          ZOIL leaves with the two men and returns to his vehicle. The
          voice of ZOIL's superior cuts the air.

                         VOICE
          Report.

                         ZOIL
          We've tracked them down to a gas
          station in Ely.

                         VOICE
          So why am I not witting with my
          feet up, smoking a jay, watching
          Erin Brockovich?

                         ZOIL
          We think he may be travelling in an
          RV with two British men sir.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.

                         VOICE
          Goddamnit, I knew we should have
          gone ahead with invasion in "44.
          What are they, MI6?

                         ZOIL
          No, sir. Just a couple of nerds on
          the lamb from Comic-Con.

                         VOICE
          Shit. My sister's kid went to that.
          Little Manga faggot.

                         ZOIL
          I still think this stinks, sir.

                         VOICE
          Like fat man doo-doo. It's too much
          of a coincidence. He sits tight for
          60 years and then suddenly now he
          decides to take off. If he wanted
          to go home so bad, he could've just
          given us the slip when he was
          playing golf with J. Edgar Hoover.

                         ZOIL
          Someone must have told him. We need
          to find the rat.

          Leave that to me. In the meantime,
          if E.T. is still M.I.A. in the P.M.
          then F.Y.I. I'm tearing someone a
          new A. O.K.?

                         ZOIL
          Yes sir.

          INT. RV - DUSK

          GRAHAM is sat in the Chewie seat, PAUL is reading Jelva,
          Queen Of The Varvak. CLIVE drives.

                         GRAHAM
          What do you think?

                         PAUL
          Ask me when I've finished it.
          CLIDE rubs his yes.

                         GRAHAM
          You tired, Sausage?

                         CLIVE

                         (WHISPERING)
          Don't call me Sausage in front of
          him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry. Are you tired though?

                         CLIVE
          Mummy, I am bushed.

                         GRAHAM
          What do you need?

                         CLIVE
          Best case, I'd like a cold flannel
          on my neck and an honest meal.

                         GRAHAM
          I hear that, Big-Rig. I can still
          call you Big-Rig can't I?

                         CLIVE
          Sure. Just not Sausage. Any luck
          with an RV park? We need somewhere
          off the beaten track, n'est pas?

                         GRAHAM
          Roger that. Cup of Joe?

                         CLIVE
          You read my mind.
          GRAHAM head to the galley, ignoring PAUL, who jumps into the
          Chewie seat and stares at CLIVE.

                         CLIVE
          Can I help you?

                         PAUL
          You want a cigarette?

                         CLIVE
          No, thank you. I don't smoke.
          PAUL lights a cigarette, the smoke wafts into CLIVE's face.

                         PAUL
          Look, I'm sorry okay? About eating
          the bird.
          CLIVE continues to ignore PAUL. GRAHAM arrives with the
          coffee and a Honey Bun cake.

                         GRAHAM
          Honey Bun?

                         CLIVE
          Could you unwrap it for me?

                         GRAHAM
          By your command.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.
          GRAHAM unwraps the cake and pops it into CLIVE's gob. PAUL
          watches. GRAHAM disappears to the back of the RV.

                         PAUL
          Let me ask you something. Are you
          to...?

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAUL
          You know...
          PAUL does a very weird, very long charade, demonstrating
          various "group' and "one on one' homosexual practices.

                         CLIVE
          No!

                         PAUL
          Okay, that's great. I just
          wondered. I'm cool with it.
          Everyone's "bi' where I'm from.
          It's all about the pleasure thing,
          you know? We've evolved beyond
          paranoid notions of gender
          identity. I mean, procreation is
          only the functional aspect of
          sexual congress right? The human
          race is fairly advanced but most
          males still act like a cornered
          tiger if you imply the like
          "smoking the bone' and let's face
          it they probably do. Look at single
          sex, empirical institutions,
          boarding schools, prisons, pirate
          ships, places where the choice has
          been removed, everyone's banging
          everyone else and there isn't a
          whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get
          out into the real world and guys
          are getting smacked int he chops
          for wearing pink socks. You think
          you're so sophisticated because you
          can distinguish yourself from your
          own reflection but ultimately
          you're part of a deeply neurotic
          species and you'd all be a lot
          better off if you stopped worrying
          and learned to love the bum.

                         CLIVE
          What are you trying to say?

                         PAUL
          Maybe you should start smoking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

          INT. RV - EVENING

          Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park.
          GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind,
          steadying himself on the backs of their chairs.

                         CLIVE
          Great find, Graham.

                         GRAHAM
          I sourced a website listing off the
          beaten track, North American RV
          parks.

                         PAUL
          I really lucked out with you nerds,
          didn't I?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed
          hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate.

                         GRAHAM
          It's awfully quiet.

                         CLIVE
          Just the way we like it.
          PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on
          the horn.

          HOOOOOOONNNNK!

                         CLIVE
          Stop doing that!

                         GRAHAM
          Someone's coming.
          PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp.

                         VOICE
          Hello?

                         CLIVE
          (quietly to Graham)
          We're just a couple of regular guys
          on a tour of the less touristy side
          of the American midwest.

                         GRAHAM
          I don't think she heard you.

                         CLIVE
          I was talking to you.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh, sorry.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         VOICE
          Hello?
          GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid-
          twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She
          wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares
          at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton
          John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You".

                         RUTH
          Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe.

                         CLIVE
          Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come
          in?

                         RUTH
          Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is
          $50 for the night, plus $10 for
          hook ups an I'll need to hang onto
          an ID too.
          CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone.

                         GRAHAM
          We're just a couple of regular guys
          on tour of the less touristy side
          of the American midwest.

                         RUTH
          Where you heading next?

                         GRAHAM
          Uh, east... apparently.
          CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it.

                         RUTH
          England?

                         CLIVE
          Yes. London.

                         RUTH
          I love London.

                         CLIVE
          Have you been?

                         RUTH
          No. Did you know it was founded by
          the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Yes.

                         RUTH
          Oh. I'd love to go someday.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

                         GRAHAM
          You should.

                         RUTH
          There's lots a places I wanna go.
          Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The
          world's a big place. I need one of
          these though.

                         CLIVE
          You don't have a passport?
          RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare.

          MALE VOICE (O.S.)
          RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry

                         RUTH
          That's my father. I'll come over
          and take your money in the morning.
          Have a pleasant night now, won't
          you?
          RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM
          watches RUTH intently as they pass.

                         CLIVE
          Doors to manual and cross check.
          Graham? Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          Hmmm?
          PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         PAUL

          BOO!

          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

          RUTH is walking back to a static mobile home. From the RV we
          hear GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. RUTH furrows her brow, turns
          back, and goes inside.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          RUTH enters a static mobile home and heads for kitchenette.
          From the ad-joining room we hear the sound of someone using a
          police radio scanner. Garbled reports fade in and out. We
          perhaps even hear ZOIL's voice briefly amid the static.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          What took you so long?

                         RUTH
          I was just talking.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.
          RUTH stirs a pot on the stove. She surreptitiously retrieves
          an atlas from a drawer an starts to read.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          You talk to much.

                         RUTH
          Sorry Papa.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          How long they staying?

                         RUTH
          Just the night I think

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Hook ups?

                         RUTH
          Uh-huh.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Where they headed?

                         RUTH
          East.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Them California plates I saw?

                         RUTH
          Yes, but they're from London.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          London, Ohio?

                         RUTH
          No, London, England.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Where?!

                         RUTH
          England, Papa. It's in North
          Western Europe.
          The atlas is snatched out of RUTH's hands. Behind her stands
          the towering figure of MOSES BEHE. Almost as wide as he is
          tall, his eyes glitter with fury and menace.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Europe? I'll give you Europe,
          missy. Now, get and make my supper.
          MOSES lumbers off with the atlas. RUTH looks dejected.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          EXT. RV PARK - LATER

          QUICK CUTS as GRAHAM and CLIVE hook up power and water to the
          RV and prepare a small BBQ.

          INT. RV - MOMENTS LATER

          The door to the RV opens, GRAHAM and CLIVE jump in. PAUL
          lowers his book and is blinded by their headlamps.

                         PAUL
          Arrghh, what the fuck?!

                         GRAHAM
          Hungry?

                         PAUL
          I ate already.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look suddenly sad.

                         PAUL
          Too soon?
          They nod.

                         PAUL
          Hey, I'm sorry. I'd love to break
          bread with you guys. What are we
          having?
          GRAHAM waves a foot long hot dog around.

                         GRAHAM
          Willies!
          PAUL gives CLIVE a "see what I mean?' look.

                         CLIVE
          I'll flame up the BBQ pit. Fire's
          my forte.
          CLIVE sparks up his lighter and waves it around looking
          mysterious. He then turns and jumps down all three steps and
          slams the door of the RV behind him.

          EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT

          CLIVE is squirting lighter fluid over a fire. He flicks his
          tongue out, summoning the flames higher. PAUL materializes
          nearby, making CLIVE jump. He composes himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         PAUL
          Hello Clive. From the squirting of
          the gas and the flicking of the
          tongue, am I do assume you're a
          Hendrix fan?

                         CLIVE
          I am actually, yes.

                         PAUL
          I met him once.

                         CLIVE
          Really?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Nice man, really soft, He
          thought I was a hallucination.
          Shame what happened to him.

                         CLIVE
          All the good ones die.

                         PAUL
          Meanwhile Bryan Adams releases
          album seventeen.
          PAUL and CLIVE share a laugh.

                         CLIVE
          So you've been here for 60 years?

                         PAUL
          I know, right? Time flies when
          you're confined to a U.S. military
          installation.

                         CLIVE
          Why did you come to earth?

                         PAUL
          I'm the vanguard of a highly
          aggressive invading force.

                         CLIVE
          What?!

                         PAUL
          I'm fucking with you, man. I was on
          a science mission actually.
          Meteorological reconnaissance. We
          were surveying atmospheric
          conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class
          planets. My specialist subject is
          tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing
          around the mid-west, looking for
          twisters and all of a sudden my
          A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in
          the middle of some field.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

                         PAUL (CONT'D)
          Next thing I know, this little girl
          is pulling me out of the wreck and
          then a bunch of army guys come
          along and cart me off to Area 52.

                         CLIVE

          51.

                         PAUL
          No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full
          of old Pan Am jets and mini disc
          players and shit. It's another
          "clever subterfuge."
          GRAHAM joins them with the food.

                         PAUL
          Just telling him about Area 52.

                         GRAHAM
          Ha ha yeah.

                         PAUL
          So, with my cover blown and the
          natives cautious but friendly, I
          figured we might as well indulge in
          a little file sharing.

                         CLIVE
          Mulder was right!

                         PAUL
          Mulder was my idea.
          They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas.

                         CLIVE
          Would you like a go?
          PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the
          Hendrix face. They laugh loudly.

          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT

          RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are
          on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three
          pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted
          against the campfire. She frowns.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)

          RUTH!
          RUTH backs away into the shadows.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

          INT. RV - MORNING

          It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa.
          There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE
          emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns.

                         CLIVE
          Who is it?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          It's Ruth.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens
          the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair.

                         RUTH
          Good morning.

                         CLIVE
          Good morning.

                         RUTH
          May I come in?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.
          CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as
          RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV.

                         RUTH
          Was everything to your liking?

                         CLIVE
          Yes, thank you.

                         RUTH
          Where's the other one?

                         CLIVE
          The other one?

                         RUTH
          It's okay, we don't charge by the
          person. That was three pairs of
          legs I saw last night cavorting
          round the camp fire, right?

                         CLIVE
          Oh the other one. Um...

                         PAUL
          I'm in the can. I ate a closed
          mollusc.
          PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         GRAHAM
          I like your shirt.
          The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in
          the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!"

                         RUTH
          Thanks. I got it at my church.

                         GRAHAM
          Why would Jesus want to shoot
          Charles Darwin?

                         RUTH

                         (BRIGHTLY)
          Because of his theories. Are you
          men of God?

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a coffee?

                         CLIVE
          I suppose we're men of science.

                         GRAHAM

                         CLIVE-
          RUTH narrow her eye.

                         CLIVE
          If we believe in anything it would
          be macro evolution. Cause and
          effect. The establishment of a
          biological order from the maelstrom
          of physical and chemical chaos.
          RUTH looks scandalized.

                         GRAHAM
          Or it could be God. You just don't
          know do you?

                         RUTH
          God created the earth in six days
          and on the seventh he rested.
          PAUL emits another huge raspberry from the toilet.

                         CLIVE
          Did you know that the universe has
          been dated as being 13.5 billion
          years old an that the release of
          neutral hydrogen at the moment of
          the big bang has enabled scientists
          to do this with categorical
          accuracy?

                         GRAHAM
          Yes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         CLIVE
          Not you!

                         RUTH
          The world is 4000 years old.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Oh come on!

                         GRAHAM

                         PAUL-

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Horseshit!
          RUTH approaches the toilet door, taking up her fight with the
          unseen third passenger. She bangs on the door. GRAHAM and
          CLIVE are bewildered by this sudden turn of events.

                         RUTH
          Explain to me how something as
          complicated as the human eye simply
          comes into being.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Oh, don't give me that old
          irreducible complexity crap-

                         RUTH
          They eye is comprised of three
          interacting parts. Remove any one
          of them and it ceases to exist. It
          has the precision and delicacy of a
          pocket watch and, when the good
          Lord permits, it works in perfect
          harmony with its environment.
          Something as functionally perfect
          as that doesn't just occur without
          the intervention of a guiding hand.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          But it didn't just occur did it? It
          is the culmination of millions of
          years of development across
          countless species.

                         RUTH
          What are you talking about?

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Evolution baby.
          RUTH screams and bangs the door.

                         RUTH
          It'd design!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          If He designed it, why didn't He
          just make it one part and take the
          whole weekend off?

                         RUTH
          Nothing you can so or do can shake
          my belief, or faith in the sure and
          certain knowledge that God made
          Heaven and earth and created us all
          in His own image.

                         PAUL
          Oh yeah?
          (stepping out of the toilet)
          Well then how do you explain me?
          RUTH's mouth hangs agape in a soundless scream, her eye rolls
          up, her hair turns white. She collapses.

                         PAUL
          And that's Jenga.

                         CLIVE
          What did you do that for?

                         PAUL
          I didn't do anything, she fainted.

                         CLIVE
          She saw you!

                         PAUL
          Oh come on. Who's gonna believe
          anything she says?

                         CLIVE
          The authorities will be on the look
          out for exactly this sort of thing.

                         PAUL
          What, a delusional, one-eyed God
          botherer?

                         CLIVE
          Paul, right now they're going to
          follow any lead they can get.

                         PAUL
          I didn't think of that.

                         GRAHAM
          We could take her with us.

                         PAUL/CLIVE
          What?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         GRAHAM
          We're only going to be a couple of
          days. We could let her go once
          Paul's gone home. I'm sure she'll
          be fine once she gets to know us.
          PAUL and CLIVE consider this.

                         CLIVE
          How am I going to get my passport
          back?
          PAUL vanishes.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          Leave it to me.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          The door opens, seemingly by itself. PAUL materializes in the
          kitchenette and starts looking around for CLIVE's passport.
          He roots around noisily in drawers and cupboards, until he
          spies his quarry on the work-top. He checks the passport and
          finds CLIVE's absurd picture. He laughs.

                         PAUL
          Hallelujah.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Ruth, what in the Lord's name-
          MOSES and PAUL come face to face. They regard each other for
          a second.

                         PAUL
          Boo?

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is
          loading a shotgun.

                         PAUL

          GO! GO! GO!
          The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM
          appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as
          MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's
          arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a
          booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the
          RV careens off out of the trailer park.

          INT. RV - DAY

          Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives,
          GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         GRAHAM
          Hi.

                         RUTH
          Where am I?
          PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile.

                         PAUL
          Hey, look who's up.

                         RUTH

          DEMON!

                         GRAHAM
          Would you like a cup of tea?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm so sorry it had to be this way
          Ruth. We're definitely not going to
          hurt you and we'll let you go as
          son as we can. We were just a
          little concerned that you might
          call the police.

                         RUTH
          You have been deceived. Deceived by
          an agent of Satan himself.

          PAUL (O.S.)
          You know I'm sitting right here?

                         GRAHAM
          He's not a demon Ruth, he's from
          another world and we're helping him
          get home. He's not evil. He's just
          very rude.

                         RUTH
          How can he be from another world?
          There is only one world. Our world,
          created by God the Father.
          PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers.

                         PAUL
          Look, if it makes you feel any
          better, my existence only disproves
          the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo-
          Christian God, as well as all
          single earth theologies. Science
          still hasn't categorically rule out
          the notion of divinity, even though
          evolutionary biology suggest the
          non-existence of a creator by
          probability alone.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         RUTH
          How could that possibly make me
          feel any better?

                         PAUL
          Jesus Christ, I was just trying to
          be nice!

                         GRAHAM
          I think what Paul's trying to say
          is, just because there are other
          inhabited planets, it's not the end
          of the world.

                         RUTH
          This isn't happening! You're a
          hallucination. You're not real.
          You're a test. A test from God.

                         PAUL
          You can't win can you?
          RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an
          awful noise.

                         CLIVE
          I can't drive like this. We'll have
          to drop her off and take our
          chances.

                         GRAHAM
          No!

                         PAUL
          Oh, for God's sake.
          PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her
          forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up
          into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The
          cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's
          ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL
          telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They
          collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette.

                         GRAHAM
          What did you do to her?!

                         PAUL
          I broadened her horizons.

                         GRAHAM
          Can you broaden mine?

                         PAUL
          No, it's tiring.
          GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh please.

                         PAUL
          Come here then.
          PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all
          fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls.

                         CLIVE
          Oh great! Everyone knows the
          secrets of the universe apart from
          me. He always knew what was going
          on in Buffy before me because his
          mum had cable.

                         PAUL
          Can't I just tell you?

                         CLIVE
          No spoilers!
          PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps
          CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert.

                         GRAHAM

                         (WEAKLY)
          Maybe I should make that tea?

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          I didn't call the government. I
          called the po-lice.

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY


                         ZOIL
          Given your description of the
          intruder, the police felt your call
          was perhaps better directed to us.

                         MOSES BEHE
          And who are you?

                         ZOIL
          Secret Service, sir.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I knew it. You know that devil took
          my Ruth.

                         ZOIL
          And Ruth's your daughter?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         MOSES BEHE
          That's right. Her Mama died when
          she was born. I good as brought her
          up by myself. Wasn't easy either.
          Two mouths to feed and this place
          to run.

                         ZOIL
          I understand. Do you have a
          photography of Ruth, Mr. Behe?
          MOSES retrieves an old cigar box and produces a tattered
          photograph of Ruth. She appears younger, with both eyes
          intact and with dark hair.

                         ZOIL
          She's pretty.
          MOSES snorts.

                         ZOIL
          Do you have a phone Mr. Behe? In
          case she tries to contact you.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I do...
          ZOIL nods at HAGGARD who immediately starts dialling on his
          satellite phone, moving into a different room.

                         MOSES BEHE
          ...and she'll call me if she can.
          Ruth's never really been outta
          Carbon County.

                         ZOIL
          You say they went East?

                         MOSES BEHE
          Uh-huh. They'll have to get off the
          191 after Flaming Gorge if they
          ain't using the interstate, there's
          been a rig spill just South of
          Dutch John.

                         ZOIL
          So?

                         MOSES BEHE
          So that means they'll be on the 44.
          Only way to go.
          ZOIL looks at O'REILLY.

                         ZOIL
          Let's go. Haggard!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Tell me you're gonna kill that
          thing, Mr. Zoil. Kill it for what
          it is.

                         ZOIL
          We'll do our best, Mr. Behe.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Watch yourself now. I seen its
          eyes. It's evil.
          ZOIL, HAGGARD and O'REILLY leave. MOSES watches them.

                         MOSES BEHE
          God's speed, Mr. Zoil.

          EXT. RV PARK - DAY

          ZOIL's radio crackles to life.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          Man, that way was one fat freak!

          O'REILLY (O.S.)
          If I was that girl, I think I'd
          rather take my chances with the
          alien.
          HAGGARD and O'REILLY hoot with laughter.

                         ZOIL
          Can it, you two! How many times do
          I have to tell you?

          INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          MOSES is sat at his kitchen table listening to his police
          scanner. HAGGARD and O'REILLY's laughter rattles loudly over
          the radio.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          We do not refer to the target as
          "The Alien'.
          MOSES's expression is mixture of fury and disbelief. He
          glances at something nearby. Pull focus to the shotgun, lying
          in the foreground on the kitchen table.
          We hear an engine splutter into life, revving furiously.

          EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY

          MOSES in his pick up truck, screams off in pursuit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

          INT. RV - DAY

          CLOSE on PAUL. He is staring at something in wonder.

                         PAUL
          Wow.
          Pull out to reveal him sitting next to GRAHAM and CLIVE,
          looking out through the RV's windshield.
          We see their POV. A breathtaking panorama of natural beauty.
          They are parked up at the summit of a mountain road, looking
          out across the vista.

                         PAUL
          There it is, boys. Wyoming.

                         CLIVE
          Is that where we're going?

                         PAUL
          Maybe. I gotta tell ya. It's at
          times like these you winder if the
          intelligent design crowd aren't
          onto something. I mean look at it.
          Hey Ruth, get up here.
          They look round, the door of the RV is open, RUTH is gone.

                         PAUL
          Ruth!?

                         CLIVE
          Someone should go after her.
          Graham?
          CLIVE looks round to see GRAHAM gone.

                         CLIVE
          Graham!?

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          RUTH is storming up the road.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth!

                         RUTH
          Leave me alone!

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, please stop, I've got shin
          splints.
          RUTH stops. GRAHAM catches up to her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you alright?

                         RUTH
          He can't be from space. It's not
          possible.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's
          not just possible, it's probably.
          There's probably millions of
          intelligent civilizations.

                         RUTH
          So, where is everybody?

                         GRAHAM
          Well, one of them is right there.
          RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the
          dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window.
          CLIVE is trying not to laugh.

                         RUTH
          Everything I've ever been told is a
          lie. My purpose. My truth. All
          false. DO you know how that feels?
          To suddenly have nothing?

                         GRAHAM
          Just because your truth wasn't the
          truth, it doesn't mean there is no
          truth, Ruth.

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          I understand you're probably
          feeling very confused right now.
          Religious belief systems are
          devised to give us context and
          security. To stop us feeling lonely
          and unimportant.

                         RUTH
          I do feel lonely and unimportant!
          How can this all be an accident? It
          doesn't make sense. Did you know
          the reason we have solar eclipses
          is because the sun is exactly 400
          times bigger than the moon and the
          moon is exactly 400 times closer to
          the earth?
          GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it.

                         RUTH
          How can that be an accident.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.

                         GRAHAM
          It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it
          probably is. That's the beauty of
          the universe.

                         RUTH
          But what's the point? If there's
          nothing afterwards, what's the
          point in living?

                         GRAHAM
          This is the point, Ruth. Right now.
          This conversation. That tree, your
          next cheeseburger. Life is a
          miracle. People spend so much time
          focusing on rescuing the princess,
          they forget how much fun it is to
          fight the dragon.

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or
          new, that stressed the magnificence
          of the universe as revealed by
          modern science might be able to
          draw forth reserves of reverence
          and awe hardly tapped by the
          conventional faiths.'

                         RUTH
          Huh?

                         GRAHAM
          It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's
          wonderful because it means we still
          have things to learn. We still have
          life to live.

                         RUTH
          I'm frightened.

                         GRAHAM
          So am I, but it passes, sort of.
          Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure
          and I think you should come with
          us. I know you feel confused and
          lost but if you get back on board
          that RV, you might just find the
          very thing you're looking for.

                         RUTH
          I... I'm not sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         GRAHAM
          I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I
          can honestly say, I have never
          talked to a woman for this long
          without blushing.

                         RUTH
          That's so sweet.
          GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red.

          INT. RV - DAY

          GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased
          with himself.

                         GRAHAM
          She's going to be fine. I think
          your hair looks good by the way.
          You look like Storm.

                         RUTH
          Who's Storm?

                         PAUL
          From X-Men.

                         GRAHAM
          Exactly.
          RUTH goes to the bathroom.

          RUTH (O.S.)

          AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR!

          EXT/INT. RV - DAY

          The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE,
          RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations.
          GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on
          the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back.
          CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just
          behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns
          round, she looks away.
          PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH
          just behind. The RV weaves from side to side.

                         CLIVE
          Small corrections! Small
          corrections!
          RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY

          We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the
          road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a
          taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see
          HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The
          truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the
          wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up
          suddenly, looking rattled.

          EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY

          The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous
          landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE
          NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads

          "LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL
          leaps back and forth over the line.

                         PAUL
          11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock,
          12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on!
          It's fun.
          We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the
          road watching PAUL.

                         RUTH
          This is the furthest I've ever
          been.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ZOIL's convoy pulls into an Arby's. The three AGENTS leap out
          of their cars and run in. After a short pause MOSES BEHE's
          pick up truck passes through shout; "Onward Christian
          Soldiers' blares from the radio.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. PAUL hangs
          back. RUTH emerges from the bedroom. She has swapped her
          Darwin T-shirt for one of GRAHAM's. It's an X-files T-shirt
          emblazoned with a UFO and the legend, I WANT TO BELIEVE.

                         RUTH
          You don't mind, do you, Graham?

                         GRAHAM
          It looks nice.

                         PAUL
          Hey, we should stop for something
          to eat. Are you hungry, Ruth?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.

                         RUTH
          What?

                         CLIVE
          I'm hungry.

                         PAUL
          What's new, fatty?

                         CLIVE
          Hey, it's not fat, it's power. I
          happen to be very strong.
          PAUL summons a phlegm ball with a grotesque snort and spits
          it onto the floor of the RV.

                         PAUL
          Pick that up then.

                         CLIVE
          So childish.

                         RUTH
          Maybe I should call Papa.

          PAUL/GRAHAM/CLIVE
          What?!

                         RUTH
          Look, I've been missing for a whole
          day. If he's called the police,
          they'll be looking for us and if
          they find us, this "amazing
          adventure' is going to come to an
          end real quick. I just need to tell
          him I'm fine and that I'll be back
          soon, okay?
          PAUL offers up a high five to RUTH.

                         PAUL
          Right up top!
          RUTH yelps, terrified that PAUL is going to zap her again.

                         PAUL
          Too soon?
          CLIVE reaches down and picks up PAUL's phlegm ball.

                         CLIVE
          I did it!

          EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and RUTH step out of the RV.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

                         CLIVE
          Okay, in and out, yes? Don't talk
          to anyone unless you have to and
          try to look inconspicuous.
          Angle on the most conspicuous threesome in America.

          HOOOOOOOONNNK.

                         CLIVE
          I wish he'd stop doing that!
          They enter the bar. Parked nearby, is a black Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, dented.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar is very busy. Scantily clad waitresses serve a
          variety of customers. People play pool, other people dance to
          a small band. RUTH spies a pay phone at the back.

                         RUTH
          I won't be long.

                         CLIVE
          We'll order food and wait for you
          at the bar.

                         RUTH
          Okay.

                         CLIVE
          Be careful.
          RUTH walks through to the back, past the toilets. As she
          passes, MOSES BEHE steps out of the Men's, they miss each
          other by moments. He walks up to the bar, next to GRAHAM and
          CLIVE who are looking at a menu. MOSES orders.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Tap water.

          INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - MOMENTS LATER

          RUTH dials. She listens nervously. Click.

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Ruth Behe?

                         RUTH
          Yes?

          OPERATOR (O.S.)
          Please hold, your call is being
          diverted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         RUTH
          Wait, I...

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Ruth Behe?

                         RUTH
          Yes?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Agent Zoil, Secret Service. Listen
          very carefully. You're in great
          danger.

                         RUTH
          How did you...?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          We know who you're travelling with
          Ruth. I need you and your friend to
          turn yourselves in.

                         RUTH
          What if we don't want to turn
          ourselves in?

          INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

          ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop
          nearby. O'REILLY listens in.

                         ZOIL
          Where are you? Where are you
          headed?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I don't know.

                         ZOIL
          Look, I know you think you're doing
          the right thing but I promise you,
          I'm only thinking about you. And
          Paul. You care about Paul, don't
          you?

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I don't know how I feel about him.
          He's weird and also, rude.

                         ZOIL
          Yes he is.

          RUTH (O.S.)
          I asked him why he wore shorts and
          he said if he didn't I'd see his
          big spaceman balls.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

          INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT

          Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL.

                         RUTH
          Who's there with you?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Ruth, please listen to me. Your
          father is worried about you. We
          want to get you home. I need you to
          tell me where you are.

                         RUTH
          He showed me things.

                         ZOIL
          You're not still talking about his
          balls, are you?

                         RUTH
          I... i just want to know what's
          real. I'm confused. I... I...
          RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)

          WE GOT HER!

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Damnit, Haggard!
          RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she
          may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into
          two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused.

                         JAKE
          Hey, slow down there cyclops.

                         RUTH
          I need to get to my friends.

                         GUS
          Why the hurry? You know I got a
          friend with one eye who'd love to
          meet you.

                         RUTH
          I happen to have two eyes actually.
          I just have a severe stigmatism.

                         JAKE
          You should get that fixed up.
          Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the
          right light.

                         GUS
          Yeah, the dark.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RUTH
          Papa said the Lord would fix it.

                         GUS
          The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing
          sweetheart.

                         RUTH
          No shit.
          RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles
          up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts.

          INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food,
          RUTH returns from the Phone.

                         GRAHAM
          How's your dad?

                         RUTH
          We need to leave now.

                         CLIVE
          We're still waiting on a wet fries.
          The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry.

                         JAKE
          Holy shit! It's the space faggots
          that dinged the fuck-mobile!

                         CLIVE
          Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps
          we can exchange insurance details?

                         JAKE
          I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended.

                         GUS
          These the "friends' you told us
          about, baby?

                         RUTH
          Yes, they are.

                         JAKE
          Well whaddya know? Small world.

                         RUTH
          We were just leaving.

                         GUS
          I don't think so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.
          JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest.

                         GRAHAM
          Leave her alone!

                         JAKE
          What did you say?

                         CLIVE
          (timid but resolute)
          He said, leave her alone.
          At this, JAKE pulls his fist back to hit CLIVE, knocking a
          tray of drinks all over a table full of men. They immediately
          spring up and lunge after the MEATHEADS who turn their
          attention to the attack. The fight spreads like fire. GRAHAM
          grabs RUTH's hand and follows CLIVE as he scrambles through
          the fracas. As they reach the door RUTH is yanked back and
          comes face to face with her father.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH?!

                         RUTH

          PAPA?!

                         CLIVE
          Graham?

                         MOSES BEHE
          I'm taking you home.

                         RUTH
          I... I can't.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Don't talk back to me, girl!

                         RUTH

                         PAPA I-
          A chair smashes across MOSES's head, knocking him out. Behind
          him, bloodied and angry are the two MEATHEADS.

          EXT. BAR. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH explode out of the bar and run toward
          the RV. The MEATHEADS crash out after them.

                         RUTH
          What about Papa?!

                         JAKE
          Hey, we ain't finished with you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         CLIVE
          Graham, take Ruth into the RV and
          lock the door. I don't want either
          of you to see this.
          CLIVE turns back to the MEATHEADS. BANG! CLIVE is struck in
          the face, he falls, nose bleeding.
          They turn to RUTH and GRAHAM, who back up against the RV. The
          MEATHEADS approach ominously. The RV door bursts open. PAUL
          stands silhouetted against the interior lights.

                         PAUL
          Yo fucknuts!
          The MEATHEADS freeze. PAUL vanishes, then reappears a few
          feet from them, their eyes bulge.

                         PAUL
          So, who wants to get probed first?
          The MEATHEADS swoon and simultaneously hit the deck.

                         GRAHAM
          Ha! Only one of us fainted!

                         PAUL
          Tell me you got the food?
          CLIVE gets up and opens his coat revealing bags of food.
          Sirens wail in distance. RUTH turns white.

                         RUTH
          It's them.

                         GRAHAM
          Who?

                         RUTH
          It wasn't my fault. They answered
          the phone. He knew all about us.

                         CLIVE
          Who? Who are you talking about?

                         PAUL
          Get in the RV!
          SMASH CUT. The RV roars to life, backing up at speed into the
          MEATHEAD's vehicle. MOSES BEHE bursts out of the bar, just as
          the RV passes. RUTH sees him out of the window. MOSES locks
          eye with his daughter. He runs to his pick up but realises he
          doesn't have his keys. The RV tears off into the night,
          leaving MOSES BEHE bellowing with anger and the Lincoln
          Escalade, shiny, mean, fucked.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

          INT. RV - NIGHT

          The RV pulls off the road into a secluded lay-by. The gang
          sit in silence for a while.

                         GRAHAM
          Was that your dad, Ruth?
          RUTH nods.

                         CLIVE
          He was so angry.

                         RUTH
          He's always angry.
          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL all exchange looks.

                         GRAHAM
          Are you alright, Ruth?
          RUTH nods, still distant.

                         PAUL
          I'm feeling pretty amped up. Anyone
          wanna take a walk?

                         CLIVE
          I'm game.

                         GRAHAM
          You want to come for a walk, Ruth?

                         RUTH
          Thanks, but I think I'm going to
          turn in. It's been a long day what
          with meeting you guys, being
          abducted by and alien and having my
          whole belief system called into
          question.

                         PAUL
          Sorry about that.

                         GRAHAM
          It was amazing though, wasn't it?
          Remember when Paul said "Yo
          fucknuts'? That was brilliant.

                         PAUL
          You gotta talk the talk, right?

                         CLIVE
          What about when I got smacked in
          the nose?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         PAUL
          Yeah yeah Snorlax, you're a real
          hero. Come on. Let's skedaddle. You
          want anything Ruth?

                         RUTH
          No, you go, I'll be fine. Here
          Clive.
          RUTH hands CLIVE her handkerchief. It is embroidered with the
          words "JESUS SAVES'.

                         CLIVE
          Thank you.
          He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers.

                         GRAHAM
          You can sleep in my bunk if you'd
          like.
          She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back.

                         GRAHAM
          I'd use a pen to push the tissues
          off the bed. I've had a cold.

          EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT

          GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag
          of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing
          store. PAUL looks in the window.

                         PAUL
          Hey Graham. Check this out. What
          d'ya think?
          PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a
          child, displayed in the window.

                         PAUL
          I'd look pretty hot, right?

                         GRAHAM
          Space cowboy.

                         PAUL
          Steve Miller Band. I love that
          song. Speaking of midnight tokers,
          I got a littler herbal refreshment
          in my pants. Do you guys partake?

                         GRAHAM
          No.

                         PAUL
          Shame. I get it from the military.
          This is the shit that killed Dylan.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         GRAHAM
          Bob Dylan's still alive.

                         PAUL
          Is he?
          CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer.

                         CLIVE
          Let's party!

          EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland
          clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking
          beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint.

                         GRAHAM
          So why "Paul'? It's not very, you
          know, alien.

                         CLIVE
          Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or
          something?

                         PAUL
          No.

                         GRAHAM
          P-o-o-u-r-l?

                         PAUL
          No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or
          the little guy from Simon and
          Garfunkel.

                         CLIVE
          Paul Simon.

                         PAUL
          Paul Simon. Paul's not my real
          name. It's a name I got given.

                         GRAHAM
          What's your real name?

                         PAUL
          You won't be able to pronounce it.

                         CLIVE
          I can speak Klingon.

                         PAUL
          What a geek.

                         CLIVE
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         GRAHAM
          Come on, what's your real name.
          PAUL opens his mouth and screeches.

                         PAUL
          Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa.

                         CLIVE
          Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa.

                         PAUL
          That's pretty good.

                         GRAHAM
          Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger.

                         PAUL
          Fuck you!

                         CLIVE
          Calm down, Rog.
          More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint.

                         GRAHAM
          You look like a poster on a
          student's wall.

                         PAUL
          That was my gag! "Take me to your
          dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine.
          Never saw a dime.

                         GRAHAM
          You never answered my question. Why
          Paul? Who called you Paul?

                         PAUL
          The little girl who found me when I
          crashed. It was terrible actually.
          I killed her dog. I didn't mean to!
          My ship sort of landed on it. When
          the military arrived I was
          delirious; I kept saying "Paul?
          Paul?" It was the only English I
          knew, because I'd heard the little
          girl saying it over and over.
          Spooks thought it was my name.

                         CLIVE
          She called her dog Paul?

                         PAUL
          Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles.

                         GRAHAM
          What happened to the little girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         PAUL
          Who knows? Never saw her again.
          Think about her everyday though.
          PAUL offers the joint round. CLIVE and GRAHAM decline. PAUL
          takes a deep drag. During the following exchange, GRAHAM,
          CLIVE and PAUL start to move simultaneously as though
          governed by some kind of psychic link.

                         CLIVE
          It's strange, isn't it? Ordinarily
          in this situation Graham and I
          would be looking up at the stars,
          wondering about life on other
          planets but we know now, don't we?
          It's a bit of an anti-climax.

                         PAUL
          Thanks a bunch, Hurley.

                         CLIVE
          I don't mean that in a bad way.
          They all scratch their noses.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul, can I ask you something?

                         PAUL
          Shoot.

                         GRAHAM
          Why are you in such a hurry to
          leave?

                         PAUL
          I've outlived my usefulness.

                         CLIVE
          How so?

                         PAUL
          There's only so much knowledge I
          can share about the universe and
          quantum theory and how to make a
          really nice meatball sandwich. The
          only thing I have to offer them now
          are my abilities.

                         GRAHAM
          So?

                         PAUL
          So the only way they're going to
          get hold of them is by obtaining
          some of somatic stem cells.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         GRAHAM
          So what, do they take a swab from
          your cheek?

                         PAUL
          Negative.

                         CLIVE
          Stool?

                         PAUL
          Sadly, not that simple.

                         GRAHAM
          Blood?! Oh my god, I hate needles.

                         PAUL
          Believe me, a needle would be a
          picnic compared to what they had in
          store for me.

                         CLIVE
          I don't follow.

                         PAUL
          Stem cells are multipotent.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE look blank.

                         PAUL
          Lineage defined?
          GRAHAM and CLIVE still look blank.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          The camouflage response, the memory
          transfer, the revivification, they
          all originate in my cerebellum. In
          order to cultivate them in a
          laboratory they would have to...

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Cut your brain out.

                         PAUL
          Bingo! Fortunately, someone was
          kind enough to give me the heads
          up, if you'll pardon the pun. So,
          when they were transferring me to
          the medical facility and I noticed
          the bumper sticker on your RV, I
          figured you might be sympathetic
          types. I zapped the spooks, grabbed
          the wheel and took my chance.

                         CLIVE
          I thought the crash was our fault.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         PAUL
          Well it was, kinda.

                         GRAHAM
          So, you're saying if they catch
          you...
          PAUL draws his thumb across his neck. GRAHAM and CLIVE look
          at PAUL in horror. All three scratch their heads.

                         PAUL
          So tell me, are you guys virgins or
          what?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          No.
          They all cough.

                         PAUL
          Alright then, Clive, when was the
          last time you got laid.

                         CLIVE
          Comic-Con 2005. Ewok chick.

                         PAUL
          Three years ago you had sex with a
          midget?

                         CLIVE
          She was an Ewok!
          Sniff.

                         PAUL
          There are only two types of person
          small enough to fit inside an Ewok
          costume.

                         CLIVE
          She was a midget.

                         PAUL
          I can't believe you thought boning
          a space bear sounded less
          embarrassing than a person of short
          stature.

                         CLIVE
          I know. I'm sorry.

                         PAUL
          Was it nice?

                         CLIVE

                         WONDERFUL

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         PAUL
          You sly dog!
          PAUL rolls onto his back, clapping. GRAHAM snorts into his
          beer, laughing. CLIVE joins in. Before long, the three
          friends are rolling around in hysterics, utterly out of
          control. After about thirty seconds of this, they pass out.

          EXT. WOODS - MORNING

          The sun has just risen. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL lie round the
          smoldering camp fire sleeping soundly. PAUL is very white.
          His eyes open. He looks around.

                         PAUL
          Oh shit! Hey, wake up. Wake up. We
          fell asleep.

                         CLIVE
          How did that happen?

                         PAUL
          Sorry, I get this thing when I get
          high. It's called "projective
          empathy'. You feel what I feel.

                         GRAHAM
          Like in E.T.?

                         PAUL
          Exactly.

                         CLIVE
          Oh, thank God. For a second there I
          thought I'd got drunk on Lite beer.
          The guys gather their stuff and walk to the edge of the wood.
          Looking through the tree line they realize that the quiet
          town of last night has become very busy indeed.

                         GRAHAM
          Oh dear!

                         PAUL
          I can't walk through there.

                         CLIVE
          How are we going to get back?
          Close in on GRAHAM having the best idea of his life.

          EXT. TOWN - DAY

          GRAHAM and CLIVE walk down the busy main street, between them
          is PAUL. He is dressed in the little cowboy suit from the
          shop window, his hat pulled down low over his face.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         GRAHAM
          Maybe we should hold hands, so that
          we look like a family.

                         PAUL
          That's great! Two grown men who
          look like sex offenders holding
          hands with a child cowboy.

                         CLIVE
          You could be a midget.

                         PAUL
          You're obsessed with midgets!
          They continue on, trying to look as if nothing is strange.

                         GRAHAM
          Seem to be working, Clive. Clive?
          GRAHAM notices that CLIVE is no longer with them. He looks
          back to see CLIVE, gawping thought the window of a COMIC
          SHOP, at a sword resembling the one they saw at Comic-Con.
          The tag reads "Genuine "BLADE' Katana'. $299.99.

                         GRAHAM
          Clive, no.
          CLIVE walks into the shop. GRAHAM and PAUL follow quickly
          behind. As they enter the COMIC SHOP, MOSES BEHE emerges from
          the adjacent Drug Store. He takes a couple of pain killers
          and flexes his sore shoulders. He wanders up the road,
          scanning the passers by.

          INT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

          GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who is at the counter.

                         GRAHAM
          Now's not really the time, Sausage.

                         CLIVE
          I must have it.

                         GRAHAM
          It's very cheap. Are you sure you
          don't want to save up and get a
          proper on?

                         CLIVE
          Oh, come on, we've got time.

          INT/EXT. RV - DAY

          Close on RUTH's watch. She paces, worried.

          KNOCK KNOCK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.

                         RUTH
          Where have you been? I was worried.
          She opens the door. AGENT ZOIL flashes his badge.

                         ZOIL
          Good morning, Ma'am. Sorry to
          trouble you. Agent Zoil, Secret
          Service. Your wagon here matches
          the description of a recreational
          vehicle we're currently looking
          for. May I ask, are you alone?
          RUTH pauses a second.

                         RUTH
          Yes, I'm alone.

                         ZOIL
          Do you mind taking a look at these
          pictures?
          ZOIL pulls out three pictures and hands them to RUTH. CCTV
          shots of GRAHAM and CLIVE at the gas station and MOSES's pic
          of RUTH, looking younger, with dark hair and no glasses.

                         ZOIL
          Do you recognise any of these
          people, Miss?
          She lingers on the picture of herself.

                         ZOIL
          Miss?

                         RUTH
          No, sorry I don't.

                         ZOIL
          Where are you coming from, Ma'am?

                         RUTH
          Christian ministry in Seattle. I've
          been driving for 5 days.

                         ZOIL
          Going far?

                         RUTH
          Austin.

                         ZOIL
          Great town.

                         RUTH
          Oh yes. It has an impressive bat
          population you know?

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         RUTH (CONT'D)
          Folks gather by the rive in the
          evening to watch them fly out. Turn
          the sky black. Quite a sight.

                         ZOIL
          Is that so?

                         RUTH
          Uh-huh. Well, I really should be
          getting along.

                         ZOIL
          Of course. Thanks for your time,
          Miss...?
          Beat.

                         RUTH
          Darwin, Charlotte Darwin.
          ZOIL smiles and nods. He laves.

          INT. COMIC SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

          GRAHAM and CLIVE are at the counter. CLIVE is trying out the
          blade. PAUL, in cowboy guise browses the racks of comics. He
          picks one up. The cover features an alien that looks a lot
          like him. The comic is called "Encounter Briefs: Tales From
          the Dreamland'. PAUL smiles and shakes his head. He suddenly
          realises he is being watched. Next to him is a child, (8)
          small enough to see under PAUL's hat. He is looking at the
          cover of the comic and back at PAUL.

                         PAUL
          How's it going?

                         CHILD
          Is that you?

                         PAUL
          No.

                         CHILD
          It looks like you.

                         PAUL
          Suppose it does. What's your name?

                         CHILD
          Keith Nash.

                         PAUL
          I'm Paul. Pleased to meet you.
          They shake hands.

                         PAUL
          You on your own here, Keith Nash?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         KEITH NASH
          My Mom's shopping for some new
          jeans. She lets me wait in here.

                         PAUL
          Sounds like a good Mum.

                         KEITH NASH
          Yes and no. What're you doing here?

                         PAUL
          My friend's buying a sword. He's a
          grown man.

                         KEITH NASH
          What a nerd.
          PAUL laughs. So does KEITH NASH.

                         PAUL
          You an M&Ms man, Keith?
          PAUL produces his M&Ms. He offers one to KEITH.

                         KEITH NASH
          I am but I shouldn't.

                         PAUL
          Strangers with candy, right?

                         KEITH NASH
          Right.

                         PAUL
          Well, we've got a lot in common. We
          both like comics and M&Ms. Guess
          that makes us pals.

                         KEITH NASH
          Guess so.
          KEITH beams at PAUL and takes a few M&Ms. They turn their
          attention back to the racks of comics. PAUL pulls one out
          called "G-Men'. On the cover it shows an agent, not unlike
          ZOIL, shooting an alien not unlike PAUL.

                         PAUL
          You read this one?

                         KEITH NASH
          No.

                         PAUL
          It's a good one. Take it. Go on.
          It's a gift.

                         KEITH NASH
          Thanks Paul.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          KEITH stuffs it down his trousers. PAUL laughs. We hear MRS.
          NASH calling from the street.

                         KEITH NASH
          I gotta go.

                         PAUL
          Catch you later, Keith Nash.
          GRAHAM and CLIVE approach. CLIVE has a long sword shaped box
          under his arm and a big grin on his face.

                         CLIVE
          Who was that?

                         PAUL
          Keith Nash. How much was that?

                         CLIVE
          $299.99. It's made of a low grade
          Turkish alloy.

                         PAUL
          What did you get, speccy?

                         GRAHAM
          X-Men action figure.

                         PAUL
          Jesus Cheeeerist.

          EXT. COMIC SHOP - DAY

          GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL exit the comic shop. PAUL waves to
          KEITH NASH, who now sits outside, on a bench, with his
          MOTHER. The boys walk up the street, seconds later, HAGGARD
          and O'REILLY step out of a store, eating bags of candy.

          MRS. NASH
          Don't lie, Keith.

                         KEITH NASH
          I'm not lying.

          MRS. NASH
          Oh, come on now, Keith. If you
          carry on like this, you'll have to
          come with me to Dress Barn.

                         KEITH NASH
          Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and
          his name was Paul!

          MRS. NASH
          Whoever hard of an alien called
          Paul?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY
          stands nearby.

                         HAGGARD
          What did you say, kid?

          MRS. NASH
          Excuse me. Who are you?

                         HAGGARD
          Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret
          Service.

          MRS. NASH
          Secret Service?!

                         HAGGARD
          Kid?

                         KEITH NASH
          He was in the shop.

                         HAGGARD
          Is he still in there?
          KEITH shakes his head.

                         O'REILLY
          Did he say where he was going?
          KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the
          PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in
          the entirely wrong direction.

                         HAGGARD
          South. Toward New Mexico, huh?
          KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks
          meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the
          street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel.

                         O'REILLY
          We've got him man! We're going to
          get a fucking promotion.

                         HAGGARD
          You did good kid. Want a candy?

                         KEITH NASH
          No thanks.

                         HAGGARD
          Let's go.
          The two agents rush off.

                         O'REILLY
          What about Zoil?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

                         HAGGARD
          Screw Zoil!

          EXT. WOODS - DAY

          MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends
          down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now
          stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking
          hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up
          the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up
          is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber
          towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Where the hell do you think you're
          going?
          HAGGARD can't hide his frustration.

                         HAGGARD
          We picked up a lead, sir. Little
          kid in the town said he saw an
          alien. Said he was heading toward
          New Mexico.

                         ZOIL
          And you were just gonna take off?

                         HAGGARD
          Thought it best to take the
          initiative, sir. We were going to
          radio you.

                         ZOIL
          Well now, that's mighty civil of
          you. We have a chain of command. I
          expect you to abide by it. Where
          d'you say he was headed?

                         HAGGARD
          New Mexico sir.

                         ZOIL
          Well, then let's move it.
          They scramble.

                         ZOIL
          Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting
          ideas about your station again.
          ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY

          MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his
          hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Zoil, what the hell's going on?

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          They've double back sir. They're
          heading toward New Mexico.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You better be right about this,
          Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of
          this shit. I want that little
          fucker's brain in a jar by sundown.
          MOSES smiles darkly.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Looks like you're going the wrong
          way, Agent Zoil. That's what
          happens when you don't got the Lord
          on your side.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large
          roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK
          WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign.

          INT. RV - DAYBREAK

          The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and
          PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is
          holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her.

                         PAUL
          He likes you, y'know?

                         RUTH
          Graham? D'you think?

                         PAUL
          What are you, blind?
          Beat.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          Beat.

                         PAUL
          What you got there, a stigmatism?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.
          RUTH nods.

                         PAUL
          You know you can get on operation
          for that, right?

                         RUTH
          Papa said the Lord would fix it.
          Guess that's not gonna happen,
          seeing as we're living in a
          gigantic godless universe, with no
          hope of salvation.

                         PAUL
          Hey, I don't know categorically
          that it's godless. I just said
          "probably'.

                         RUTH
          Oh, that's a relief.

                         PAUL
          Look, the way you're feeling now,
          that's why religion appeared in the
          first place. It's like existential
          Prozac. Imagine being five year
          sold and having no adults around to
          tell you why it snows or what trees
          are for. That's how it is for much
          of humanity. Faith is a night-
          light. It illuminates the scary
          corners, fills the gaps, makes the
          universe easier to comprehend.
          Thing is, it's okay not to know
          everything. I mean, who knows
          what's really out there? Did you
          know astrophysicists recently
          identified the equation for the
          creation of matter?

                         RUTH
          Yes.

                         PAUL
          Oh. Well, then you get it, right?
          If they have the theory, who's to
          say at some point in the future
          they won't put it into practice and
          who's to say someone else didn't do
          that 13.5 Billion years ago and
          that's how the universe came to be?
          Course, then we get the eternal
          problem of who created the creator
          but that's a whole other car park.
          I think Shakespeare said it best.
          "There's more in Heaven and earth
          than is dreamt of in your
          philosophy Horatio".

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         RUTH
          What did you call me?

                         PAUL
          Horatio. It's from Hamlet. You
          know, the Prince of Denmark?

                         RUTH
          Denmark has a municipal population
          of 508,691.
          PAUL blinks.

                         PAUL
          Anyway, if there is a God, didn't
          he create doctors and hospitals and
          scalpels and shit, so he wouldn't
          have to go round fixing people's
          lazy eyeballs?

                         RUTH
          I suppose so.

                         PAUL
          The eye is a delicate and complex
          thing, Ruth. You should get it
          taken care of.
          RUTH smiles. PAUL smiles back. RUTH looks out of the window,
          just as PAUL reaches out to touch her face.

                         RUTH
          They're back.
          PAUL withdraws his hand. GRAHAM and CLIVE are approaching the
          RV clutching a large firework. They climb aboard.

                         PAUL
          Perfect.

          ZOIL!
          ZOIL jumps but gathers his composure quickly.

                         ZOIL
          Yes, sir?

          Satellite's come up with a data
          analysis on all the traffic coming
          out of Prospect in the last 5
          hours. There was only one RV, and
          guess what, nimrod?

                         ZOIL
          It wasn't going to New Mexico?

                         VOICE
          That's a three pointer Agent Zoil.
          You better spin your ass around.
          You got some serious catching up to
          do. Don't make me come out there.

                         ZOIL
          No, sir. Where are they headed? If
          we gun it, maybe we can get the
          drop on their destination.

                         VOICE
          They're on the 50, heading towards
          Gillette.

                         ZOIL
          What else is around there?

                         VOICE
          Not much. Thunder Basis, Bethlehem
          Creek.

                         ZOIL
          Bethlehem Creek?

                         VOICE
          Holy shit!

          EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

          ZOIL's motorcade pulls a spectacular U-turn and heads back up
          the highway in the opposite direction.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAYBREAK

          MOSES listens intently to his scanner.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          You don't think she's sill there,
          do you?
          MOSES smiles.

          MOSES BEHE's pick-up truck pulls a similarly spectacular turn
          and heads in a different direction.

          Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming
          GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the
          RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene.

                         GRAHAM
          You don't think she's still there
          do you?

                         PAUL
          That's what you're going to find
          out for me.

                         CLIVE
          Us?

                         PAUL
          I can't just knock can I? What if
          she's moved on and someone else
          answers? I'm sick of people
          fainting on me. I'll hang back with
          my buddy Ruth, you two make first
          contact. Just enjoy it.

                         CLIVE
          What shall we say if it's her?
          We're here with the alien that
          killed your dog sixty years ago?

                         PAUL
          Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be
          a really big storm in exactly 34
          minutes.

                         RUTH
          How do you know?

                         PAUL
          It's my job to know.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          GRAHAM knocks on the door.

                         GRAHAM
          Hello?

                         CLIVE
          Knock again.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          Leave me alone!

                         GRAHAM
          Okay.
          GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him.

                         CLIVE
          Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive
          Gollings and this is my friend and
          colleague, Graham Willy. We're from
          England and we're here with the
          alien that killed your dog 60 years
          ago.
          Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to
          reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her
          eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         TARA
          What is this, some kind of joke?

                         CLIVE
          It's no joke.
          PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE.

                         PAUL
          Hello Tara.
          TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house.

                         PAUL
          Aw nuts.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits
          opposite, staring at PAUL.

                         RUTH
          Maybe I should make some tea.

                         TARA
          Where are my manners? I never
          really have guests. Nobody comes up
          here. I go whole weeks without
          seeing a soul.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.
          TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are
          sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match.
          PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say.

                         PAUL
          Can I do anything to help?
          TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand.
          PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him.

                         TARA
          I've only just stopped believing in
          you, y'know? Spent a very long time
          trying to convince folk about what
          happened that night. My parents, my
          friends. Everyone thought I was
          mad. They told me it was a meteor
          that squashed little Paul. Took me
          away and did tests they did, said
          it was for cosmic radiation. They
          said I was concussed,
          hallucinating, but I knew you were
          real. I pulled you from that
          spaceship myself. Sat with you till
          the men came and took you away. If
          Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he
          would have seen you too. They kept
          telling me I'd imagined it but I
          knew different. Pop tried to
          understand but they filled his head
          with "delayed this' and "post-
          traumatic that'. He just used to
          smile and say "there, there Tara'.
          He got sick when I was seventeen
          and died a few years later. I
          inherited this place. Word got out
          about my story not long after it
          happened, so I didn't really have
          any friends. Kids used to throw
          stones at the house and call me
          names. I just kinda retreated into
          myself. I'd spend whole nights up
          on the roof, staring at the sky,
          hoping to catch a glimpse of you
          again. I always believed that one
          day you"d come back and here you
          are.
          The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out.

                         TARA
          Listen to me gabbing. Milk and
          sugar?

                         PAUL
          I'm so sorry.

                         TARA
          What for?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         PAUL
          For killing your dog and ruining
          your life.

                         TARA
          That doesn't matter. Don't you see?
          You're real. I was right and all
          those folk that said I was crazy?
          Well, they can all go fuck
          themselves.

                         PAUL
          It's good to see you, Tara.
          The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas
          canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog.

                         TARA
          Now, where do you suppose that came
          from?

                         PAUL
          Fuck a duck! Get out!

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          Shit!

                         PAUL
          Tara, where's the back door?

                         TARA
          In back.
          The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door
          splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          The gang quickly barricade the door of the next room and
          continue on toward the back of the house. They find the back
          door, just as it is opened by ZOIL. The gang freeze. PAUL
          vanishes, then reappears right next to ZOIL, putting his hand
          across ZOIL's forehead.

                         ZOIL
          Paul, wait-
          A burst of psychic images explode into ZOIL's head. The agent
          and the alien fall on the ground in an exhausted heap.

                         PAUL
          Clive?

                         CLIVE
          Yes?

                         PAUL
          A little help?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          CLIVE picks PAUL up. HAGGARD approaches, gun drawn.

                         HAGGARD
          Freeze, space monkey!

                         GRAHAM
          We're cut off.

                         TARA
          Storm cellar!
          TARA opens a nearby door and motions them down some stairs,
          as HAGGARD fires wildly. Crockery explodes around them.

                         ZOIL
          Godammit Haggard!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. CELLAR - DAY

          The gang descend into a dim room. It is full of UFO
          paraphernalia. Models, toys, books, souvenirs from every UFO
          hot spot in the land. One the wall is the "Take Me To Your
          Dealer' poster. PAUL sees it.

                         PAUL
          Not a fucking cent.

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          ZOIL comes to. He sees HAGGARD at the cellar door. Screeching
          brakes draw his attention as MOSES BEHE's truck skids up. He
          gets out, shotgun in hand.

                         ZOIL
          Oh great!

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          TEAM PAUL climb out of the cellar and start to run towards
          the RV, PAUL still in CLIVE's arms. It starts to rain.

                         PAUL
          Come on!

                         GRAHAM
          Ow, my shins!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY

          ZOIL sees MOSES run round to the front of the farmhouse.

          Help me up!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          O'REILLY sees TEAM PAUL running toward the RV from the front
          room. He levels his pistol at PAUL and squints.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          TEAM PAUL reach the RV and start to board, just as MOSES BEHE
          lumbers into view.

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH!

                         RUTH

          PAUL grabs RUTH's hand.

                         PAUL
          Come on.

                         MOSES BEHE
          (levelling his shotgun)
          Take your hands off her, devil!

          INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY

          O'REILLY find his mark. Pull back to reveal he is stood by
          the kitchen door, through which we see the cooker, the simmer
          of gas in the air.

                         O'REILLY
          Ready or not.
          He fires.

          KA-BOOM!!!
          O'REILLY is vaporized in a ball of orange fire.

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          The farmhouse explodes. ZOIL and HAGGARD who are only just
          clear, hit the deck, covering their heads. MOSES is knocked
          off his feet as flaming wood and debris rain down.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          I'll drive!

          Punch it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.
          The RV roars into life, reversing out onto the road. CLIVE
          pulls a spectacular U-turn, sending the passengers flying.
          GRAHAM lands in TARA's arms, RUTH in PAUL's. RUTH and GRAHAM
          exchange glances. Dumb luck. TARA straightens herself and
          looks out of the RV at her destroyed home.

                         TARA
          My weed!

          EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY

          ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder.
          His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE
          picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD
          drops ZOIL and runs to his car.

                         ZOIL
          Damnit Haggard, wait!
          HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great
          difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES
          BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder.

          INT. RV - DAY

          CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black.

                         GRAHAM
          Your dad's persistent, isn't he?

                         RUTH
          You have no idea.
          CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror.

                         CLIVE
          I think we have a problem.

                         GRAHAM
          What do we do?

                         PAUL
          Go left.

                         CLIVE
          What?

                         PAUL

          GO LEFT!
          CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and
          bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life.

          INT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING


                         HAGGARD
          In pursuit, sir.

                         VOICE
          Who the hell is this?

                         HAGGARD
          Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been
          compromised. I'm assuming command.

          ZOIL (O.S.)
          Now wait a goddamn minute!

                         VOICE
          I don't give a shit who's in
          command. Where' my fucking
          mooncoon?!

                         HAGGARD
          Just ahead of me sir. We're heading
          East across scrubland just North of
          Mitchell Creek.

                         VOICE
          I don't wanna hear from either of
          you jokers until that little mother
          fucker is under glass.

                         HAGGARD
          Yes sir!
          HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

          EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

          We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining
          behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES.
          HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          They're trying to overtake.

                         PAUL
          Don't let him get past.

                         CLIVE
          Shall I ram him?

          RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL

          YES!
          CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and
          skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns
          the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes
          overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood.

          INT. RV - EVENING


                         CLIVE
          What are we doing exactly?

                         PAUL

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Immense pressure and temperature
          drop. High winds, circulating in
          the troposphere, two opposed fronts
          clashing. Oh, this is going to be a
          good one.

                         CLIVE

          A GOOD WHAT?!
          RUTH stares out of the window.

                         RUTH
          Oh my God.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          A massive black funnel extends from the sky about half a mile
          ahead of the chase. It rakes the ground, reducing a small
          farm building to a million splinters.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING


                         MOSES BEHE

                         HOLY-

          INT. ZOIL'S CAR - DAY

          ZOIL is sat mouth agape.

                         ZOIL
          -Shit!

          INT. RV - EVENING

          CLIVE swerves to avoid a grain silo, which comes bouncing
          across the ground toward them.

                         CLIVE
          Are you sure you know what you're
          doing?!

                         PAUL
          Twenty seconds.

                         TARA
          Paul, we'll get sucked right up.

                         PAUL
          Stay on target.
          A branch smacks on the windshield, cracking it.

                         CLIVE
          Paul!

                         PAUL
          Stay on target.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The grain silo bounces close to ZOIL's car, he swerves to
          avoid it and stops. MOSES pulls up just ahead. MOSES and ZOIL
          get out of the vehicles, almost unable to stand against the
          wind and debris. They watch the RV, now a good distance in
          front, heading for the heart of the tornado.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         ZOIL
          He's insane!

                         MOSES BEHE

          RUTH!
          HAGGARD's car screams past. ZOIL grabs his radio.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, stand down. Stand down!

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          He's mine. I can do this!

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, it's suicide.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING


                         CLIVE

          PAUL?

                         PAUL

          NOW!
          The funnel suddenly evaporates into the sky, leaving the path
          ahead clear and oddly calm.

                         GRAHAM
          It's gone!

                         CLIVE
          Where did it go?

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          ZOIL watches amazed. He almost smiles.

                         ZOIL
          Son of a bitch!
          ZOIL looks at the sky. His face drops.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard. Wait a minute!
          An engine revs nearby. ZOIL turns to see MOSES BEHE pull off
          in pursuit.

                         ZOIL

          MR. BEHE!
          (into is radio)
          Damnit, hang back, hang back!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          You're not running this show any
          more Zoil. You had your chance.

                         ZOIL
          Haggard, he knows what he's doing.

          HAGGARD (O.S.)
          So do I.

                         ZOIL
          It's a trap!

          INT. RV - EVENING


                         CLIVE
          They're still coming!

          WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO?

                         PAUL
          Ruth, why don't you count back from

          10?

                         RUTH
          Okay. 10...9...

                         PAUL
          Back where I'm from, tornadoes are
          part of our daily life. We've
          learnt how to live with them, how
          to understand them.

                         CLIVE
          They're gaining!

                         PAUL
          We've learnt to anticipate their
          behavior, know their personalities,
          know when they're playing games.

                         RUTH

          3...

                         GRAHAM
          What games?

                         PAUL
          Hide and seek?

          107.
          CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes
          down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD.

                         CLIVE
          Great Caesar's ghost!

                         RUTH
          How did you do that? How did you
          know?

                         PAUL
          Evolution baby.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          The tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has
          time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex.

          INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING

          A wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck
          round, heading back in the opposite direction.

          EXT. SCRUB - EVENING

          MOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car.

          MOSES BEHE (O.S.)
          Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!
          ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV.

          INT. RV - DAY


                         CLIVE
          We've lost them.
          TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and
          whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back.
          GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away.

                         GRAHAM
          Sorry.

                         RUTH
          Wait, what about Papa?

                         CLIVE
          I only saw one car following us.

                         PAUL
          Where's Tara?
          TARA comes out of the toilet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         TARA
          The bulb's gone in there.

                         GRAHAM
          That was just awesome. Amazing
          driving Clive. It was like G.T.A.
          but potentially fatal. Wasn't it,
          Clive? Clive?
          A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine.

                         CLIVE
          Oh no.

          EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING

          The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It
          whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around
          surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the
          grill, reveals the cause of her downfall.

                         GRAHAM
          There goes the deposit.

                         CLIVE
          Fare thee well friend. You were a
          faithful and mighty steed.

                         TARA
          She rode that storm with a bullet
          in her heart and didn't stop until
          we we're safe.

                         RUTH
          If there is a benevolent creator
          watching over everything then may
          he, she or it bless the 1985
          Holiday Rambler, Imperial.
          Everyone looks to PAUL for his comment but he is not there.

                         GRAHAM
          Paul?

          PAUL (O.S.)
          We're here.
          PAUL is stood away from the RV at the foot of a small hill.
          He starts to climb. The others follow. Crane up as TEAM PAUL
          climb the hill to reveal a sight familiar to anyone who has
          seen Close Encounters Of The Third Kind...

          Zoil! What the hell is going on?

                         ZOIL

          What about the other one?

                         ZOIL
          I lost him when the ranch exploded.

                         VOICE
          Jesus Christ, Zoil, this has been
          one fuck up after another. I should
          have handled it myself. I want that
          little bastard dead by midnight
          tonight or you'll be working
          security in a convention centre.
          Now where's that RV?
          ZOIL's eyes widen. Parked on the roadside is the RV.

                         VOICE
          Zoil? ZOIL?
          ZOIL is staring at DEVIL'S TOWER.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER - DAY

          TEAM PAUL hike towards the tower.

                         RUTH
          What you may not know is on the
          outside of the tower they bolted a
          series of ladders, all the way to
          the top, put there by William
          Rogers in 1893. He was the first
          man to climb the tower.

                         TARA
          I climbed up there in 1976. Thought
          it would make a good site for some
          UFO spotting. Turns out I wasn't
          the only one.

                         PAUL
          We call them IFOs.

                         TARA
          Cute.

                         PAUL
          I-thank-you.

          EXT. SMALL ROAD - DUSK

          ZOIL opens the trunk of his car. He pulls out a large piston,
          spare ammo and a webbing pack which he slings around his
          shoulder. He sets off up the hill.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          TEAM PAUL are walking round the tower. As they round the
          corner the landscape changes, the trees give way to a piece
          of open pasture flanked by pine forest, the tower opens
          itself up slightly, a perfect natural amphitheatre.

                         PAUL
          This is it.
          PAUL takes out the firework, Zippo and cigarettes from his
          back pack. He lights his last cigarette and takes a drag.

                         PAUL
          I'll miss these.
          PAUL takes the firework a little way off and sticks it in the
          ground. He crouches down and lights the touch paper with the
          cigarette, then scampers back to the gang. Beat. The firework
          rises into the sky. It explodes. The star-burst is massive
          and bright red, it illuminates the tower.

                         TARA
          Pretty.

                         GRAHAM
          What now?

                         PAUL
          We wait.
          A light appears in the sky some way off.

          PAUL (CONT'D)

                         (FROWNING)
          That was quick.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

          ZOIL runs through the bush, fast, like a wild animal. His
          face fixed with serious intent, gun in one hand, torch in the
          other.

          TEAM PAUL watch as the ethereal light draws nearer.
          Spotlights cut through the night, searching beneath.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. FOREST - NIGHT

          ZOIL leaps a fallen tree. Ahead, through the trees, he sees
          an ethereal glow. He pulls the slide back on his pistol.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          The lights are really close now. They are accompanied by a
          deep rumble. A very earthly sound. Rotor blades.

                         PAUL
          Wait a minute...
          A HELICOPTER swoops in to land, kicking dust and debris into
          the air. TEAM PAUL turn back to the woods but are stopped by
          the sight of a torch getting nearer.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Oh shit.
          Behind them, the HELICOPTER powers down. The door opens.

                         VOICE
          Well, whaddya know? Small world.
          VOICE appears flanked by two faceless, heavily armed
          SOLDIERS. They level their weapons, just as ZOIL bursts
          through the trees behind them.

                         ZOIL

          PAUL!

                         PAUL
          Lorenzo?!
          PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The
          bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the
          bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the
          bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes
          past him, slamming into one of the soldiers.
          ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second
          shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He
          leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the
          cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his
          shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward,
          holding a smoking gun.

                         VOICE
          It was you! You told him. I
          should've known.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         VOICE (CONT'D)
          You've never made a mistake in your
          life. That's why I put you in
          charge of this fucking mission.

                         ZOIL
          He's my friend! I've known him for
          twenty years. He introduced me to
          my wife damnit!

                         VOICE
          You stupid son of a bitch. In five
          years, you could have been where I
          am.

                         ZOIL
          I don't want to be where you are.

                         VOICE
          Too bad, seeing as I'm the one
          hold'ng all the cards and when I
          say "cards", I of course mean big
          fucking gun.
          VOICE points his gun at PAUL.

                         PAUL
          How'd you find me?

                         VOICE
          It was pretty easy once we got a
          fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard
          to figure out where you were
          headed. You always did have a flare
          for the dramatic.
          PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth.

                         VOICE
          Let's go.
          TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then
          CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body.

                         CLIVE
          He's not going anywhere.

                         VOICE
          Be honest with yourself, two
          scoops. What is it that you think
          you can possibly bring to the table
          at this stage in the game?
          CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD,
          he holds it like a proud Samurai.

                         CLIVE
          Blind fury.
          The blade falls off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         CLIVE
          Bloody low grade Turkish alloy.

                         VOICE
          Step aside, you fat nerd.

                         CLIVE

                         (IN KLINGON)
          Graham, his this man.
          CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the
          unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly,
          blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke.
          RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head.

                         RUTH
          Leave him alone!
          VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack.

                         GRAHAM
          Leave her alone!
          VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA.

                         TARA
          Leave them alone.
          WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick.

                         TARA
          You're not taking him away again.
          He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious.

                         PAUL
          Thank you, Tara.

                         TARA
          Don't mention it.
          PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded.

                         ZOIL
          The things I do for you, huh?

                         PAUL
          You know I appreciate it.

                         ZOIL
          Do you have any idea how difficult
          it was to catch you guys?

                         PAUL

                         (LAUGHS)
          Let me take a look at that. Ruth,
          shine the torch down here?
          RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          114.
          BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to
          see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white,
          his eyes wide.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth.

                         GRAHAM
          Noooooooooo!
          GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of
          blood around her mouth.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I...I never meant to shoot her. I
          was aiming for the goblin.

                         CLIVE
          He's not a goblin he's from another
          planet.

                         MOSES BEHE
          But he can't be. He... he...

                         GRAHAM
          He's an alien you stupid man! Oh
          Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.
          I should have never persuaded you
          to come with us.
          RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly.

                         RUTH
          What, and miss all this? Graham,
          I've lived more in the last 48
          hours that I ever did in that
          trailer park. Isn't that what you
          said living was all about? Right
          now? This conversation? That tree?
          My next cheeseburger? I'm not
          afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold
          though. Hey, where is everybody?
          RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM
          buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled
          with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder.

                         MOSES BEHE
          What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so
          sorry.
          A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL,
          silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint.

                         PAUL
          There is no way this thing isn't
          gonna end happy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          115.
          PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest.
          MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Get away from her! Don't you touch
          my little girl.
          CLIVE holds out a hand to stop MOSES. He obeys. The air hums,
          charged with static. PAUL's skin ripples with color. Everyone
          watches transfixed. RUTH's eye flickers and opens. With some
          difficulty, she sits up and takes off her glasses. She blinks
          both shining, healthy eyes.

                         GRAHAM
          Ruth, are you okay?

                         RUTH
          I think so. Is anyone hungry? I
          really feel like a cheese burger.
          Relief and joy spreads through group. MOSES falls to his
          knees and sobs. He feels a hand on his shoulder and looks up
          to see PAUL.

                         MOSES BEHE
          Thank you.
          RUTH and GRAHAM hug. She smiles at him.

                         RUTH
          You can kiss me now.
          They kiss with awkward passion. Everyone smiles then after a
          bit become uncomfortable and a bit grossed out.

                         PAUL
          Looks like the geek shall inherit
          the earth.

          CLICK CLICK.
          The group turn to see VOICE, upright, pointing his gun.

                         VOICE
          I wouldn't say-

          SPLAT.
          A large spaceship lands hard on top of VOICE. Everyone looks
          shocked. PAUL, GRAHAM and CLIVE exchange a look.

                         PAUL
          Happens to the best of us.

          EXT. DEVIL'S TOWER. CLEARING - NIGHT

          Some time has passed, a number of PAUL style aliens are now
          present.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          116.
          One of them uses a big hose to clean the remains of VOICE
          from the hull of the ship. Another two help the now healed
          soldier to their feet, patting them on the back and shaking
          their hands. The atmosphere is amiable.
          TEAM PAUL look at one another. ZOIL and MOSES have joined
          them. PAUL kisses and hugs RUTH.

                         PAUL
          I'm sorry I frightened you so much
          your hair turned white.

                         RUTH
          You didn't frighten me. You freed
          me. You helped me see the light.

                         PAUL

                         (TO MOSES)
          Take care of her big man.

                         MOSES BEHE
          I will sir. God be with you.

                         PAUL
          Whatever dude.
          They high five. PAUL turns to ZOIL, whose arm is in a
          makeshift sling and shakes his hand.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Lorenzo Zoil, you're a good man.
          Say bye to Karen for me.

                         ZOIL
          Safe trip Short Round.
          PAUL turns to GRAHAM and CLIVE. He pulls JELVA - ALIEN QUEEN
          OF THE VARVAK from his pocket and hands it to them.

                         CLIVE
          You can keep it.

                         PAUL
          Cool. Okay.

                         GRAHAM
          What did you think?

                         PAUL
          Yeah. Three tits, awesome. Although
          you know what? Sometimes, less is
          more.
          The boys nod.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          Thank you.

                         GRAHAM
          No, thank you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          117.

                         CLIVE
          You are, and always will be, our
          friend.

                         PAUL
          Come here you fucking geeks.
          They hug. He takes in incandescent orb from his pocket.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          This is a self-sustaining light
          orb. Might come in handy, you know,
          if a bulb goes.
          TARA is waiting for her goodbye but PAUL ignores her. He face
          drops as he walks to his ship. He turns to her.

          PAUL (CONT'D)
          You coming?

                         TARA
          What?

                         PAUL
          I ruined your life Tara. Think I
          owe you a new one.
          TARA takes PAUL's hand.

                         TARA
          I don't have my toothbrush.

                         PAUL
          Baby, where we're going, you won't
          need teeth.
          TARA frowns then follows PAUL aboard. PAUL and TARA stand in
          the doorway. One of the other ALIENS comes out of a small
          room behind them, speaking in a strange tongue.
          Subtitle: THE BULB'S GONE IN THERE.
          As the door slowly closes, GRAHAM and CLIVE give PAUL the
          CE3K salute. PAUL gives them the finger. The boys laugh,
          tears in their eyes. The ship lifts off into the sky. GRAHAM,
          CLIVE, RUTH, MOSES and ZOIL watch them go. The light form the
          ship gradually fades, leaving them in darkness. Pause.

                         GRAHAM
          That was good, wasn't it?

          INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY

          We are at Comic-Con the following year. We come to rest on a
          long line of people. Sat behind a table are GRAHAM and CLIVE.
          They look more confident, cooler. CLIVE is talking to a short
          woman in an EWOK costume. He pats her on the ass as she walks
          away. All around them are stacks of their new novel: PAUL.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          118.
          A banner hangs behind, displaying the cover, GRAHAM's own
          rendering of their alien friend. They sign copies. The
          PUBLICIST mills around, looking very pleased.

                         PUBLICIST
          Just one item per person please.
          He winks at the boys. RUTH rushes up to GRAHAM, she is
          dressed as Storm from X-Men and pushes a customized buggy, in
          which sits a baby dressed as Professor X.

                         RUTH
          Hey.

                         GRAHAM
          Hey babe. You okay?

                         RUTH
          I'm just taking Tara over to the
          autograph pavilion. Michael Biehn's
          here!

                         CLIVE
          Oh, say hi from us, won't you?
          RUTH kisses GRAHAM. Two nerds approach.

                         MAJOR NERD 1
          Uh... were you... did you?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          There you go.

          SECURITY MAN (O.S.)
          Next in line please.

                         MAJOR NERD 2
          Uh... were you... did you?

                         GRAHAM/CLIVE
          There you go.

                         SECURITY MAN
          Guys, if you've had your book
          signed please move on.
          Tilt up to reveal the security man. It is none other than
          former Special Agent LORENZO ZOIL. CRANE up to reveal the
          whole convention floor.

          EXT. FARMLAND - DAWN
          
          IN BLACK AND WHITE, A black 1930s Cadillac speeds down       
          the only visible road amidst endless plains of farmland.
          The road curves sharply ahead - the car accelerates.
          Ignoring the turn, the Caddy drives directly off the road
          and through a massive field of emptiness.
          
          The car abruptly stops in the middle of the vacant field.
          GENERAL BRAT (58, a patch covers one of his eyes) and
          AGENT BLACK SUIT (an agent in a black suit) step out of
          the car.
          
          Although there is clearly nothing in sight for miles, the
          General scans his surroundings with concern.

          Agent Black Suit crouches down and pulls open a METAL
          HATCH in the ground. Both men walk down the hatch and
          into the earth.
          
          
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          They descend a metal staircase and walk with great
          urgency down a narrow corridor. The hallway spills into a
          hauntingly huge metal room with a lone SCIENTIST standing
          in the middle. The Scientist immediately begins leading
          them across the room.
          
                                 GENERAL BRAT
                    When did it start?
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    At 05:00. We're seven minutes in.
          
          
          INT. OBSERVATION LAB - CONTINUOUS
          
          The three men enter a large room divided by a one-way
          mirror.
          
          On their side, numerous SCIENTISTS, utilizing several
          archaic devices, are busy at work monitoring the subject
          on the other side of the mirror.
          
          The subject: PRIVATE MILLER (22, naive and dutiful) sits
          at a small table with a microphone on it. Miller raises
          his hand, REVEALING a smoldering JOINT.
          
                                                                    2
          
          
          He takes a long and awkward hit from the joint and bursts
          into a coughing fit.
          
          The scientists begin to scribble profusely as their
          devices blink manically. General Brat and Agent Black
          Suit exchange a concerned look. The General lights a
          cigarette as the Scientist steps up to a small microphone
          in the corner.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                           (into microphone)
                    Private Miller, we are now going to ask
                    you several questions. How do you feel?
          
          His voice booms through large speakers on Miller's side
          of the room. Miller leans towards the microphone.
          
                                  PRIVATE MILLER
                    Uh, I feel a little queer sir. But...
                    It's good. Good queer.
                           (beat)
                    Sir. Good queer, Sir.
          
          The scientists scribble madly. One of them mumbles into
          General Brat's ear.
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER (CONT'D)
                    But...uh...even though I feel queer, Sir,
                    I should mention that I'm also feeling
                    quite gay...so, a little queer, but
                    mostly gay.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    Private Miller. When you think of your
                    superiors, what emotions do you feel?
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                           (holding out the joint)
                    This went out...Sir.
          
                                 SCIENTIST
                    We will send someone in. Now answer the
                    question.
          
          A door opens beside Private Miller and an AGENT steps out
          wearing an intricate uniform that resembles an old
          fashioned diving suit, an air hose leading out the door
          that he came from. He slowly walks toward the Private,
          who looks at him in shock.
          
                                 SCIENTIST (CONT'D) (O.S)
                           (through speakers)
                    Private Miller? Answer the question.
          
                                                                     3
          
          
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                    Oh...um...what was the question again?
          
          The Agent in the strange suit reaches the private and
          holds a lighter up to the joint.
          
                                 SCIENTIST (O.S.)
                           (through speakers)
                    What are your emotions towards your
                    superiors?
          
          Miller pulls at the joint until it is lit again. The
          Agent exits the room.
          
                                  PRIVATE MILLER
                     COUGH   COUGH  Fucking shit.
                           (beat)
                    Well, now that I think of it, it's
                    strange that they are called my
                    `superiors'. Does that make me their
                    `inferior'? I mean, that's pretty fucked
                    up.
          
          General Brat scowls.
          
                                 GENERAL BRAT
                           (curtly to the scientists)
                    I've seen enough. Shut it down. Bury the
                    hatch, sell the land, and dispose of him.
                    This never happened.
          
          Instantly, the scientists start packing up their
          equipment. Staring at Miller, General Brat grabs a RED
          PHONE and dials. Two Agents in the scuba-like suits
          emerge from behind Miller and start aggressively dragging
          him away.
          
                                 PRIVATE MILLER
                           (freaking out)
                    Hey! What the...what are you guys doing!              
                    Let go of me!
                           (desperately looking at the
                            mirror)
                    Sir!!! Sir!!! Help me!!!
          
                                  GENERAL
                           (into phone)
                    This is General Brat. We've reached a
                    final conclusion on Item 9.
                           (beat)
                    Illegal.
          
          He hangs up the phone.
          
                                                                     4

          DALE DENTON (late 20s, out of shape, slightly unkempt)
          looks out of place in his black suit as he drives he sits       
          in his cluttered and worn old lady car. He smokes a joint       
          while listening to talk radio.                                  
          
                                 TALK RADIO DJ                            
                    Well, let's look at the facts.                        
                    Financially, coins are better because                 
                    they're cheaper, and environmentally,                 
                    forget-about-it, coins win hands down.                
                    For those just joining us, we're with                 
                    caller Dale Denton discussing if America              
                    should lose the paper dollar bill.                    
          
          We see that Dale has a wireless ear piece in.                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Of course not! Who wants a pocket full of             
                    coins? Seriously. Weighs down your pants,             
                    clangs around. With all this unnecessary              
                    new security everywhere, we'll be setting             
                    off alarms left and right!                            
          
                                 TALK RADIO DJ                            
                    We certainly do, Mr. Denton. Crude, but               
                    to the point. Next caller!                            
          
          Dale puts away his phone and pulls up in front of a nice        
          house.

          Dale, wearing a name tag that reads "Garth", holding a          
          clip board and wearing a greenpeace hat, knocks                 
          repeatedly on the door. A woman cautiously answers the          
          door.

          Dale shoves an envelope into her hand.                          
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Sorry, miss, but you've failed to show up             
                    to your divorce proceedings 4 times under             
                    court order. You've been served.

          Dale dashes back to his car as the upset woman starts to        
          open the envelope.

          Dale is driving and smoking a joint. He looks at his            
          check list - it is a list of people he served that day.         
          He's only got a few left. He listens to a different talk        
          radio dj while playing music from a tiny iPod boom box          
          that sits in his passenger seat.

          His iPod starts playing HOT STEPPA by INI KAMOZE.

          Dale turns down the talk radio and puffs away at his            
          joint; he enthusiastically dances in his car while              
          singing along.

          Dale, wearing a Zerox hat, walks into the building.             
          
                                 SECRETARY                                
                    Can I help you?

                    Just here to check out some units.                    
          
          The secretary nods and goes back to her work. Dale              
          casually waltzes down the office halls looking at the           
          names on the doors. He glances down at his clipboard, it        
          read: Walter Tandum.                                            
          
          He finds the office and knocks on the door.                     
          
                                    WALTER (O.S.)

          Dale enters to see Walter, a 40 year old accountant,            
          seated at his desk.

          Dale drops a blue envelope on Walter's desk.

          Dale turns and walks away. As he does, he notices a small       
          kitchen. He enters and is delighted at the array of             
          snacks and beverages. He helps himself.

          Dale is parked at a look-out enjoying the food, smoking         
          weed and has his ear piece in.

          Dale gets out of his car, followed by some plumes of            
          smoke, and goes to his trunk. He chuckles as he takes out       
          a lab coat and walks towards the hospital.

          Dale, looking very professional in his lab coat, rushes         
          to reception.

          Dale, wearing a chauffeur hat, stands by the main               
          entrance holding a sign that reads: JOSH CORBER. A man          
          walks out of the hotel and, seeing the sign, approaches         
          Dale.

                    she? I was just telling her before I left
                    how I've never been in a limo. Can you
                    believe it? 35 and I've never been in a
                    limo. Man! It's not stretched, is it?
          
          Dale hands him a BLUE ENVELOPE.

                    Sorry, but you've been served.
          
          Dale walks away. CORBER opens the envelope and reads it.        
          
                                 CORBER

          Dale completely ignores Corber as he dumps the sign and          
          walks out of the airport. Then, a huge smile comes across
          his face. He has noticed a nearby Burger King.

          He happily walks toward the food.
          
          
          INT - DALE'S CAR - DAY
          
          Dale sits in his car   outside a high school. An array of        
          Burger King wrappers   surrounds him as he rolls a joint         
          with the last of his   weed on top of a Batman comic. He         
          lights the joint and   turns on the radio.                       
          
                                 RADIO DJ                                  
                    ...3:09 in the PM and we-                              
          
          Dale turns off the radio, takes one last haul, and then          
          snubs out the joint. He then pulls out a small leather           
          kit and sifts through it's contents: handi-wipes, hand           
          sanitizer, a little vial of cologne, Visine, mouthwash           
          and breath mints.                                                
          
          Dale vigorously wipes his hands, face, and mouth with wet        
          naps and then starts futilely attempting to put visine in        
          his blazing red eyes. Frustrated, he squirts Visine all          
          over his finger tips and simply rubs them into his eyes.         
          He uses the mouthwash, chews up a mint, dabs on some             
          cologne, and then gets out of the car.

          Dale turns to see his attractive 19 year old girlfriend,         
          ANGIE ANDERSON, walking towards him with her group of

                    So, are you going to come over for dinner          
                    tomorrow, `cause my parents are beginning          
                    to think I made you up.

                    You don't have to feel weird about it.             
                    They know how old you are and they're              
                    fine with it. They just want to meet you           
                    and see that you're a cool guy and that            
                    I'm not dating you just because you're             
                    older.

                    just...tomorrow's tight. I've got a whole          
                    bunch of cases that I can finish                   
                    tomorrow. It's probably going to take me           
                    into the night.

                    I'm 19. I moved here from Morocco.                    
          
          Dale doesn't know what to make of Mr. Edwards comments          
          and looks.

                    Alright, well this school is for students             
                    and faculty only. Friends can't just stop             
                    by.

                    Dude, you may be a teacher here, but                  
                    we're about the same age, so don't get                
                    all high and mighty. It's not that weird.             
                    Frankly, it's natural.                                
          
                                                                    12

                    Well, in that case, get off school                    
                    property or I'm calling the Police                    
                    Liaison officer. Angie, no offense to                 
                    you, but if this guy's dating someone                 
                    your age, it's because nobody his age                 
                    will date him.                                        
          
          Then, four HANDSOME AND FIT STUDENTS walk by.

                    Hey Angie. You were hilarious in drama                
                    today.                                                
          
          Angie smiles at the guys. Dale doesn't like how all this        
          is going down.

          Dale and Angie sit in the parked car making out.

                    No...actually I can't. I have to go serve             
                    a guy.

                    Yeah. It sucks. I'm sorry. We can hang                
                    out later though. You can come over.

                    We'll see if Neo is truly the one.                    
                                                                          
          
          They share a long kiss, and Angie gets out of the car.          
          Dale watches her walk away, then whips out his cell phone       
          and hits speed dial.

          joints that intersect one another). Pot and paraphernalia
          are scattered all over the coffee table. A large

          knock at the door and Dale enters.

                    Um...sure.
          
          Dale awkwardly sits down on the other side of the couch.
          
                                                                    14

                    Brass tacs. I've got this new bud.
                    Unfortunately, it's a few more bones, but
                    fortunately, it's hands down the dopest
                    fuckin' shit I ever smoked. And I've
                    smoked some dope fuckin' shit.
          
                                 DALE
                    Better than that Blue Oyster weed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude. Seriously. It's like if that Blue
                    Oyster shit and the Afghan Kush I got had
                    a baby, and meanwhile, the craziest
                    Northern Lights and that red-ass Espresso
                    Snowflake had a baby, and then by some
                    miracle those babies met, and fucked -
                    then this would be the shit they'd birth.
          
          Saul pulls out a big bag of weed. He places it on the
          coffee table as though it was his child. He pulls out a
          large bud.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Smell it.
          
          Dale takes the weed and looks at it. It looks
          spectacular. Bright red hairs and large crystals, huge
          purple and blue leaves - just spectacular! Dale smells it
          and is taken aback.
          
                                 DALE
                    What is this? It's spectacular.
          
                                 SAUL
                    It's called Pineapple Express. My guy Red
                    told me it's when this Hawaiian flood
                    takes special dirt to the weed or some
                    shit. It's pretty scientific. And I'm the
                    only guy in the whole city who has it.
                    And, its only ten bones more for a
                    quarter.
          
                                 DALE
                    So...can I get a quarter?
          
                                 SAUL
                    No doubt. Just let me grab my scale.
          
          Saul walks into another room. Dale looks around
          anxiously; he clearly wants to go.                              
          
                                                                    15
          
          
          
          A moment later, Saul comes back into the room and sits
          down. Dale notices that he didn't bring anything back
          from the other room. Saul notices Dale looking at him
          strangely.

                                 DALE
                    Where's the scale?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh shit! The scale. Be right back.
          
          Saul hustles into the other room.
          
                                  SAUL (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                           (from other room)
                    You know what's weird? How sometimes,
                    your brain just chooses to like, not keep
                    things in it, you know?
                           (beat)
                    Fucking scale.

                    Shit. Where is it?
          
          Dale checks his watch and then looks at the door;
          suddenly, something catches his eye - it's the cross-
          joint Saul was constructing.
          
                                 DALE
                    Holy shit! What the fuck is this thing?
          
          Saul comes back in and puts a small electronic scale on
          the coffee table.
          
                                 SAUL
                            (nonchalantly)
                    Ah, the cross-joint. You've never seen
                    one of these? Not surprising. They are,
                    like, the apex of the vortex of joint
                    engineering. NASA built the first one in              
                    the eighties.                                         
          
          Saul chuckles at his joke as he places some weed on the         
          scale.
          
                                 DALE
                    You can actually smoke that contraption?
          
          Saul puts Dale's weed in a baggie.
          
                                                                    16
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    You light all three ends at the same
                    time, then, you smoke it as it resonates
                    the main section, creating a "trifecta"
                    of smoking power. It's like, three times
                    as powerful as a normal joint.
          
          Dale hands Saul some money and Saul gives him his weed.
          Dale lingers for a moment.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, be careful with that thing.
          
          Dale gets up and heads to the door.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude...you wanna smoke this thing with
                    me?
          
          Dale turns around. He clearly wants to smoke it, but he
          tries to play it cool.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I can't even light it on my own.
          
          Dale sits back down on the couch, giddy as a schoolgirl.
          
                                 DALE
                           (excited)
                    Wow. So like, uh...so like, so like what
                    do I do?
          
          Saul gathers three lighters from the coffee table.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Alright. Firstly you light these two
                    ends. Then I will light the tip, making
                    the trifecta complete. Are you ready?
          
          Dale nods and they light the joint. Saul tokes hard;
          plumes of smoke fill the air as he bursts into a COUGHING
          FIT.
          
                                 DALE
                    Holy...
          
          Dale takes the joint and hits it, exploding into a
          coughing fit.
          
                                 SAUL

                    And that, combined with the pineapple
                    weed, and the cross-joint  COUGH  you're
                    a good thirty to forty times higher. I
                    don't know the exact math, but, pff,
                    you're pretty fucking gong-showed. You
                    know what I mean?
          
          Saul takes a toke. Dale coughs HARDER and HARDER. He
          seems like he might throw up.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It's crazy. The better the weed, the more
                    I wish I could think of how to explain
                    what's so good about it, but the...uh,
                    the better it is, the less shit I can
                    think of in total, you know?                         
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint, obliviously dropping ash all
          over his suit. Slightly agitated, Dale brushes it off.
          
                                  SAUL (CONT'D)

          Dale passes the join to Saul.

                    school guys these days. They're all                
                    roided out and going to Harvard. Even on           
                    my best days, I look like a fat, dumb              
                    piece of shit next to them.                        
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                    Whatever, man. It sounds like you got it           
                    pretty good. I wish I had a job that               
                    easy. Fuck.

                    Dude...you've got, like, the actual                 
                    easiest job in the world.                           
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    Hey! You're right, man. I never thought             
                    of it like that.                                    
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    You can actually do whatever the hell you           
                    want. You get to sleep all day and people           
                    come buy weed at night.                             
          
          Dale passes Saul the joint.                                   
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    That's totally true. Except tomorrow.               
                    Thanks to that bitch daylight savings, I            
                    gotta go change my grandma's clocks
                    forward at 7am. Or 8am. I seriously can't
                    figure it out.
          
                                 DALE
                    Sorry to hear that.
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yo, so, like, what have these people done
                    that you go after?
          
                                 DALE
                    Let's see...tonight I'm going after-
          
          Dale pulls a blue envelope out of his pocket.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Ted Jones. He forgot to pay his-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude! My guy, Red, gets his weed from a
                    Ted Jones. He's, like, #1 supplier in
                    town. Maybe it's him!
          
                                 DALE
                    I doubt that, man. There's probably a lot
                    of Ted Joneses's out there.                         
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yeah, but not like this one, man! He's
                    what I want to be one day. He's like the
                    "Jesus of Weed". So...I guess he's like
                    Jah. Or Scarface.
          
                                                                    20
          
          
          
          Saul points to his Scarface poster. The joint ends. After
          a few moments it seems as though their ability to have a
          conversation burnt out with the joint. They sit in
          awkward silence. Dale gets up.                                  
          
                                 DALE
                    Well Saul, that was crazy. Thanks.
          
                                 SAUL
                    No worries dude, peace.
          
          They slap each other five and Dale exits. Saul turns on
          the TV. Saved By the Bell is on. It makes Saul chuckle.
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - NIGHT
          
          Dale cruises down side streets and locates Ted's house.
          It is a large well-to-do home. Having difficulties, Dale        
          parks in between two cars across the street. He turns off
          the engine and starts smoking a joint. SUDDENLY - FLASH!        
          Two head lights appear up the street. Holy shit! It's a         
          COP CAR!
          
          He sits still, holding the joint between his legs as the
          cop car drives past and...parks a few cars down! The
          FEMALE COP walks up the block - TOWARDS DALE'S CAR!
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Oh shit on me.                                        
          
          Fortunately,   the COP crosses the street and walks towards     
          Ted's house.   Confused, Dale watches as she is let in.         
          Dale waits a   moment and then re-lights the joint. He          
          tries to see   into Ted's house as he takes a MASSIVE TOKE.
          
          BANG! A SILENCE SHATTERING BLAST comes from Ted's house.
          Dale holds the toke in and tries to keep quiet as he
          focuses on the large front window. SUDDENLY, the drapes
          are torn down by an ASIAN MAN as he falls forwards and          
          crashes through the front window!                               
          
          Dale watches in horror as a LARGE GREY-HAIRED MAN and the
          Female Cop step forward and shoot the Asian man! BLAM!          
          BLAM! Blood splatters!                                          
          
          Dale starts COUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY! He starts the car
          and, in a panicked fit, tries to pull out. CRASH!!! He
          smashes directly into the car in front of him! He flicks
          the roach out onto the grass and slams the car in reverse
          - CRUNCH!!! He backs into the car behind him! Still
          hacking his lungs out, Dale drives away!                        
          
                                                                    21
          
          
          
          The Grey-Haired Man and the Female Cop sprint out of the
          house in time to see Dale's distant tail lights vanish
          into the darkness. Something catches the Grey-Haired
          Man's eye - a trail of smoke rising from the grass. He
          lowers his blood-stained hand and picks up...DALE'S
          ROACH! He brings it to his nose and sniffs, then rips           
          open the paper and examines the weed closely.

          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Saul is laying on his couch watching Saved By the Bell,
          laughing so hard that he's crying.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ha! Ha! Ha! Screech.                                  
          
          Suddenly, the BUZZER sounds repeatedly.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                           (mumbles)
                    Fucking hell.
          
          He grudgingly walks to the intercom and presses talk.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Hello?
          
          He presses listen.
          
                                 DALE (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...me in! Let me in! Let me in!    Let me
                    in! It's Dale! Let m--
          
          Saul casually presses the talk button.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (annoyingly casual)
                    Denton? Dale Denton?
          
          He smiles to himself, then presses listen.
          
                                 DALE (O.C.)
                           (through intercom)
                    ...the love of shit, let me in! Pleeea-
          
          Annoyed, Saul buzzes him in and unlocks the door.
          
                                                                   22
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                           (to himself)
                    ...fucking, don't smoke that shit if you
                    can't handle it.
          
          A moment later, Dale, completely freaking out, BURSTS
          through the door and SLAMS it shut.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                           (startled)

                                 DALE
                    He fucking killed him, man!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Be quiet, man, I got neighbors-
          
                                 DALE
                           (quietly)
                    He killed him!
          
                                  SAUL
                           (loud)
                    Somebody killed somebody?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah, man! I can't believe it. A cop! A
                    lady, and a guy.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Somebody killed a cop, a lady and a guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! A guy!
          
                                 SAUL
                    A cop killed a guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! A cop and a guy killed   another guy!
                    The lady and the guy...No,   a fucking
                    woman, a police woman, and   an old guy,
                    shot a guy, a younger guy,   in the fucking
                    window at Ted's house!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Was the guy Ted?
          
                                 DALE
                    Which guy?
          
                                                                 23
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know, the old guy who shot the
                    guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't fucking know. He was this big,
                    old, grey haired guy with a gun, and he
                    fucking took him, and he shot him! Right
                    there in the fucking window! BAM!
          
                                 SAUL
                    I heard Ted's got grey hair!
          
                                 DALE
                    And they saw me! They saw me see them
                    shoot the guy!
          
          Saul jumps to his feet.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What!?! They saw you?!? Why the fuck did
                    you come here? Did they follow you?!?
          
          Saul dashes to the window and peeks out.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Did they follow you here!?!
          
                                 DALE
                    No! I panicked. I was having a coughing
                    fit, I crashed, I crashed into a car.
                    Fuck, two cars. They must've heard at
                    least. They knew someone was there.
          
                                 SAUL
                    But they don't know it's you?
          
                                 DALE
                    No. I don't think so. No.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So...they're not coming here?
          
          Dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. Saul shrugs,
          sits back down, then picks up his joint and re-lites it.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Cool. So, what's your game-plan? You
                    gonna call the cops? Cause if you do, I'd
                    appreciate it if you left my shit out of
                    this shit.
          
                                                                   24
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm not calling the cops - one of them
                    was a cop. They could all be cops!                   
          
                                 SAUL
                    Did you see any blood? Was it sick?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. I saw some blood.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I wonder who the guy he shot was?
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't know, who do drug dealers kill?
                    It was probably another drug dealer. He
                    was Asian. Are there Asian drug dealers.
          
                                  SAUL
                    Hell yeah, man. The Koreans teamed up
                    with, like, the Vietnamese or some shit.
                    They're crazy mother fuckers. Number two
                    in town.
                           (beat)
                    Heh. Ted's cappin' the competition. Yo,
                    you want some of this?
          
          Saul passes Dale the joint. Dale takes the joint and           
          frantically smokes as he paces.                                
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                           
                    So, like, exactly what was the sequence
                    of happenings?
          
                                 DALE                                    
                    I'm sitting across from Ted's smoking a
                    massive joint of that weed you sold me-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh, the Pineapple Express. It's so rare
                    it's almost a shame to smoke it, like
                    killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.              
          
                                 DALE
                    When I threw it...out...the window...                
          
          Dale stops pacing and stares at Saul. He then looks down       
          at the joint of pineapple weed. Saul notices wheels
          turning in Dale's head.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What?
          
                                                                  25
          
          
          
          Dale continues staring at the joint.
          
                                 DALE
                    This weed is actually that rare?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (proudly)
                    Yeah, it's like, "the rarest".
          
                                 DALE
                    So, you are actually the only guy in town
                    with this weed?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuckin' rights, I am. Red told me he was
                    giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".
          
                                 DALE
                    And am I the only guy you gave it to?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yeah. So, we're the only guys.
          
                                 DALE
                    But, like, another dealer, couldn't
                    identify it, the pineapple weed? Like, if
                    they found a roach of it, right?
          
          Saul thinks for a moment.
          
                                 SAUL
                    I could. Why?
          
                                 DALE
                           (panicking)
                    We should go, we shouldn't be here! We
                    should go!
          
                                 SAUL
                    No...seriously, why?
          
                                 DALE
                    I left a roach of this weed in front of
                    Ted's house!
          
                                 SAUL
                    So what? I leave roaches all over fucking
                    town.
          
                                                                    26
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    No, listen - they could find the roach
                    and say, "This is pineapple weed, Saul's
                    the only guy in town who has pineapple
                    weed, therefore he must have witnessed
                    the murder or know who did - let's go
                    kill him."
          
          Finally, Saul understands.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Mother of fuck!
          
          He SPRINGS to his feet and BOLTS for the door.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Let's go!
          
          Dale grabs Saul and stops him.
          
                                 DALE
                    Wait!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why!?! Let go of me! Let's get the fuck
                    out of here!
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul, wait! Grab anything we might need,
                    like your weed and money and stuff.                   
          
          Saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack.
          They run for the door.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Are you sure you're not forgetting
                    anything?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yes! Come on!
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER
          
          Saul and Dale run to the elevator and frantically press
          the button, terrified for their lives.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck! I forgot something!
          
          Saul runs back to his apartment, leaving Dale alone and
          frightened. Saul BURSTS back out of his apartment holding
          his cell.
          
                                                                    27
          
          
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Dude, I was so scared going back, I
                    thought there was gonna be guys there,
                    and then you'd be gone, and there was
                    this music in my head-
          
                                 DALE
                    We'll take the stairs, it'll be faster.
          
          They scramble towards the distant stairwell. Almost at
          the door, they hear the DING of the elevator arriving.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Go back! Go back!
          
          They DASH back to the elevator. Dale shoves his arm
          between the doors and they hop in. Saul rapidly presses
          the LOBBY button as the doors shut. They're both on the
          verge of hyperventilating.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, man. We gotta try to relax.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Why?!?
          
                                 DALE
                    We don't want to draw attention.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (freaking out)
                    Whose attention!?! You think they could
                    be down there? In the Lobby? Right now!?!
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't know! Who knows? Just try to be
                    cool.
          
           DING  The elevator SUDDENLY STOPS on the second floor.
          
                 DALE (CONT'D)                     SAUL
          Oh my god!!!                  Ahhh!!!
          
          The doors OPEN! There's no one there. The doors close.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What the fuck was that?
          
                                 DALE
                    That was bad - Calm! Calm! Calm!
          
          The elevator stops at the lobby and the doors open, they
          step out, bumping into two rough looking guys.                  
          
                                                                   28

                    Oh. Pardon.
          
          Dale and Saul quickly leave as the bikers enter the
          elevator.
          
          
          INT. SAUL'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The rough looking guys, BUDLOFSKY and MATHESON, kick in        
          Saul's door and dash into the room, guns drawn. Matheson       
          spots a smoldering joint in the ashtray.
          
                                  MATHESON                               
                    Look.
          
          Budlofsky whips out his cell and hits speed dial.              
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                               
                    Ted? He's gone, but he was just here. I              
                    think he knew we were coming.

          Dale peels out of his spot and down the road.
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay, what do you know about Ted?
          
                                 SAUL
                    What? Ted? Nothing. For all I know he's
                    tracking us with space satellites right
                    now! He's got grey hair, that's all I
                    knew.
          
          Saul checks behind them.

                    Well, how much money do you have?
          
          While Dale gets out his wallet, Saul opens Dale's change
          tray. It's full of roaches.

          The car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon-lit
          woods. Dale paces back and forth as Saul walks over.
          
                                 DALE
                    So what do we know? Nothing. We may or
                    may not be followed because we don't even            
                    know if he found the roach or not. And,
                    we could just be completely crazy. But,
                    the question is this: even if he found
                    the roach, how could he know where you
                    were?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (thrilled)
                    He couldn't. Cause I'm in the woods. It's
                    impossible! Unless he's, like, hanging on
                    the bottom of the car or some shit, but I            
                    mean-
          
                                                                  30
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    No, what I mean is, if Ted found the
                    roach and identified the weed, how could
                    he connect it to you?
          
                                 SAUL
                    There's no way. He could only find out
                    from Red.
          
                                 DALE
                    Who is this Red guy?                                
          
                                 SAUL
                    Red's pretty much a middleman between Ted
                    and guys like me. And we're mad fucking
                    tight. One time he convinced some girl he
                    knew to give me a hand-job within, like,
                    five minutes of me meeting her.
          
                                 DALE
                    But let's say someone calls asking who he
                    sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say
                    you, because...why wouldn't he?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck that. That's bullshit. He would have
                    called me if that happened. A hand-job,
                    Dale! Imagine if I'd gotten you a hand              
                    job by now!                                         
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    Yeah, but Saul, he's a fucking drug                 
                    dealer.                                             
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    So? I'm a fuckin' drug dealer. What, you            
                    don't trust me then?                                
          
          Saul stares at Dale, who doesn't know how to respond.         
          
                                 DALE                                   
                    Um...I...call him. Yeah, sure, call him.            
          
                                 SAUL                                   
                    Thank you!                                          
          
          Pleased, Saul pats Dale on the back.                          
          
                                 DALE
                    You're right. You are. I'm just being               
                    paranoid. Sorry, dude.                              
          
                                                                   31
          
          
          
          Saul takes his cell phone out and presses speed dial. We
          hear someone pick up.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                           (through phone)
                    Ow! Hello?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yo, Red. You okay man?
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Saul! Oh. I, uh...stubbed my toe.
          
          Red sounds nervous.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, watch the toes. Wear shoes in the
                    house. But Red, I gotta get straight to
                    brass tacs, I need a favor.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Sure man, anything. I'm Red.
          
                                 SAUL
                    You sure as fuck are, buddy. So, you know
                    how you gave me some of that pineapple
                    express stuff? Don't tell anyone you gave
                    it to me.
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    Sure man, no problem. Red swears it,
                    hombre.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So, can I come on over now?
          
          Dale waves his hands in front of Saul's face.
          
                                 DALE
                           (louldy whispering)
                    No! We should do it tomorrow!
          
                                  SAUL
                           (covering phone, talks to
                            Dale)
                    I'm in the middle of a convo, man. Let's
                    just go and get this shit over with.
          
                                 DALE
                    Come on, man. Tomorrow. I'm scared
                    shitless. I want to think things through
                    before I do anything. Let's go in the
                    morning. Please.
          
                                                                    32
          
          
          
          Saul looks around the dark forest.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah...okay. Less scary shit happens in
                       the day.
          
          Dale nods.
          
                                    SAUL (CONT'D)
                              (into phone)
                       Red?

                              (talking to someone else)
                       -I can hear him talking to someone, so-
                       Yo! Saul? So, you're gonna come by in the
                       morning?
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah, right after I see my grandma.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       Sure, your Grandma's retirement home- Ow!
                       Fuckin' stupid god-damn toe. I, uh, is
                       that the one on Granville and 41st.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Yeah man. I've only got one. So, we'll be
                       chillin' by noon.
          
          Saul gives Dale the thumbs up.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       Well, cool brother. Noon it is.
          
                                    SAUL
                       We should definitely hit up the casino
                       again sometime.
          
                                    RED (O.S.)
                       For sure. We should definitely hit up the
                       casino.
          
          Saul hangs up the cell.
          
                                    SAUL
                       Nice. Now let's do some fucking stone
                       cold chilling. I'll role a jigga, on the           
                       house.

                    say?
          
                                 RED
                           (incredibly afraid)
                    I didn't say shit, man! There was another
                    guy there and he said tomorrow!

                    Why did he mention the casino? The Asians
                    run the casinos. Is Saul Asian?

          EXT. FOREST - CONTINUOUS                                        
          
                                 SAUL
                    I always liked smoking weed in the                    
                    forest.                                               
          
          Saul lights a joint and starts smoking. He passes it to         
          Dale. Dale puffs. They look around at their expansive,          
          dark surroundings and immediately become overwhelmed with       
          paranoia. Saul notices a shooting star zip across the sky       
          as Dale takes out his cell phone.                               
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm going to go call Angie. Make up some
                    bull shit.
          
          As Dale dials, Saul, paranoid from the pot, looks at his
          cell phone. He takes another hit, and then looks up to
          the sky again. He looks back at Dale's phone. Dale starts
          to walk off.
          
                                                                    34
          
          
          
                                   SAUL
                    Dale...wait!
          
          Saul snubs out the joint and runs over to Dale.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, the phone...I mean, I don't know
                    how this shit works, but...can cops...
                    you said they might be cops...could they
                    triangulate our phones or trace `em or
                    some shit like that? I don't know. I feel
                    like I've seen that.
          
          Dale stares at Saul, then flips open his phone -  beep 
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    I mean, shit Dale, maybe they can trace
                    them when we're not even on them!
          
          Dale takes a hit as he looks up to the sky. Just then, a
          loud rumbling noise is heard.
          
                                 DALE
                    What the fuck is that?!
          
          The rumbling gets louder.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Are we on fucking "Lost"?! What the hell
                    is that?!
          
                                   SAUL
                    It's them!!!
          
          The noise builds to a deafening crescendo as the guys
          dive behind a tree stump. A moment later, a JUMBO JET
          buzzes overhead, heading towards the nearby airport. Dale
          and Saul pop up.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Holy fuck. That was close.

                           (clutching cell phone)
                    You know what? You're right. We should
                    just get rid of them. We should just
                    smash `em.
          
          Dale looks at his phone, which is a new, expensive Razor.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    Fuck. I just bought this thing. Maybe I
                    can just take the batteries out?

                    No! Smash it!
          
          Dale sighs, then SMASHES his phone on a rock. Saul looks
          at Dale, then HURLS his phone into the woods as hard as
          he can, sending it SAILING into the FOREST.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

                    What the fuck was that?!
          
          Dale tosses the joint aside.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck! I was trying to throw it at that

                    That one.
          
          Saul points out a group of trees about 30 feet away.

                    It was a cheap piece of shit. Came free
                    with the plan. It must've smashed when it
                    landed.

          They look into the scary dark depths of the woods. Both
          of them are clearly terrified.

          Horrified, they cautiously inch into the forest.

          Dale looks in horror as Saul vanishes amongst the trees.

                    ARGHHH!!!
          
          Dale hears a loud THUD.
          
          Scared for his life, he SPRINTS in the opposite
          direction! He weaves in between the trees, avoids some
          rocks and tree roots, stumbles on some loose dirt, then
          SLAMS half his body against a tree and FALLS HARD.
          
          ANGLE ON: SAUL
          
          Saul gets up, covered in dirt. Panting, he looks around
          the forest and sees no one. He thinks he hears something
          and SPRINTS off! WHAM! He trips on a tree root and SLAMS
          into the ground.
          
                                                                    38
          
          
          
          ANGLE ON: DALE
          
          Dale stumbles to his feet while futilely trying to wipe
          the dirt off his suit.
          
                                 DALE
                    Shit.
          
          Saul hears Dale and whips around, breaking a twig -
           CRACK 
          
          Dale looks towards the noise, then SPRINTS off.
          
          Saul hears someone and BOLTS in the opposite direction.
          
          Like chickens with their heads cut off, they both
          scramble through the woods trying to evade their
          imaginary enemies.
          
          Dale spots his car! He jumps in and SLAMS the door shut.
          He's about to turn the ignition, but stops. Panting and
          wheezing, he sinks into his seat.
          
          BAM! Something slams into the car.

          Dale and Saul start rolling separate joints.                    
          
                                                                   40
          
          
          
          
          INT. DALE'S CAR - THE NEXT DAY
          
          Dale slowly wakes up. He stretches, and then shakes Saul.
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul. Saul. Get up. Wake up.
          
          Saul opens his eyes and realizes where he is.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Fuck me.
          
                                 DALE
                    What's the time?
          
                                 SAUL
                           (groggy)
                    It's too early.
          
          Saul brings his wrist up close to his eyes.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It's...
          
          Saul stares at his watch, confused.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    This can't be right.
          
                                 DALE
                    What does it say?
          
                                 SAUL
                    It says, uh...
          
          Saul looks outside towards the sun.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    It couldn't be three in the morning,

                                 DALE
                    It's three o'clock!?! We were supposed to
                    be there at noon!

                                 SAUL
                    -I didn't go to my Grandma's! Fuck! And
                    we've gotta call Red.
          
                                  DALE
                            (angry)
                    How?
          
          Dale digs in his pockets for the keys.
          
                                 SAUL
                    We'll find a pay pho...fuck! His number
                    was in my phone!
          
          Dale notices the keys are in the ignition.
          
                                 DALE
                    You remember where he lives, right?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Yes, I remember. What the hell is that
                    supposed to mean? Are you insinuating I'm
                    forgetful? That's right, I know the word
                    insinuating.
          
                                 DALE
                    Let's just get out of here.
          
          He turns the keys. NOTHING. He tries again. NOTHING.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck? Come on.
          
          He tries twice more, but nothing happens.

                           (pissed off)
                    I think the battery's dead.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Are you fucking serious?
          
          He tries again.
          
                                  DALE
                    It's dead.
          
                                  SAUL
                    It's dead?

          Dale shoots Saul an angry look.                               
          
                                  SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                     What the fuck happened? How did this
                     happen?
          
                                  DALE
                     How? We fell asleep!                               
          
                                  SAUL                                  
                     Yeah. With your stupid talk radio. No              
                     surprise, that stuffs, like, made to put           
                     people to sleep.                                   
          
          Frustrated, Dale tries to gather his thoughts.
          
                                  DALE
                     We gotta...let's just...we'll walk. We'll          
                     walk to a road and hitchhike to Red's.
          
                                 SAUL
                     For real?
          
          Dale opens his door and hops out.
          
                                  DALE
                     Yeah, "for real". We'll be late, but               
                     we'll get there. Then we can fix this
                     insane situation.
          
          MONTAGE:                                                      
          
          - Dale and Saul walk down a seemingly unused forest road,     
          each smoking their own joint.                                 
          
          - Saul points out a giant caterpillar crawling on a leaf.
          Dale is grossed out. Saul pokes the caterpillar and then
          blows weed smoke onto it.
          
                                  DALE (CONT'D)                         
                     Stop fucking around, man. Come on. Leave           
                     that thing alone.                                  
          
          - They emerge at the highway and try to hitch a ride.
          
          - Dale notices Saul has his thumb sticking out of his         
          zipper.
          
                                  SAUL
                     It's like, my thumb is my cock!
          
          Dale doesn't laugh.                                           
          
                                                                    43
          
          
          
          - Bored and tired, they wait.   Saul lights a joint. Dale       
          notices. Saul shifts his body   away from Dale. Just then,      
          an eighteen wheeler slows for   them. Saul snubs out the
          freshly lit joint and puts it   in his pocket.
          
          
          EXT. RED'S HOUSE - LATER                                        
          
          Dale and Saul get out of the eighteen wheeler.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (to the driver)
                    Thanks a fucking ton, Sharid.
          
          Saul shuts the door and he and Dale run towards Red's           
          house - a small, dilapidated place in a rundown part of         
          town. Exhausted, Dale and Saul reach Red's door. Saul           
          knocks.
          
                                 DALE
                    So, what's this guy like?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know. He's short...and stout. So
                    he's like a tea pot. Hehe.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, do you think he'll be there?
          
                                  SAUL
                    I don't know, I mean, we are only...eight
                    hours late.

                    That's actually pretty late.                          
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                           (through door)
                    Who is it?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Red! It's Saul. Open up.
          
          Red opens the door. He has a SPLIT LIP and has clearly
          been CRYING. He tries to act normal. Dale immediately
          suspects something is up.
          
                                 RED
                           (sniffling)
                    Who's this guy?
          
                                 DALE
                    Dale. Nice to meet you.

          Red ushers them in and shuts the door.
          
                                   RED
                    Dale who?
          
                                   DALE
                    I think it's    better if you don't know my           
                    last-                                                 
          
                                 SAUL
                           (oblivious)
                    Dale Denton. He's with me. No worries.                
          
          Red notices their dirty clothes.
          
                                 RED
                           (to Saul)
                    What happened to your clothes? Where'd
                    you call me from, man?
          
          Dale notices Red quivering as he lights a cigarette and
          becomes increasingly suspicious.
          
                                 SAUL
                    We were in the forest laying low.

                    Uh, Red...what...uh, is your lip okay?
          
          Saul finally notices Red's dishevelled appearance.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Whoa! Dude, have you been crying?

                    What? Oh, I uh...
                           (feeling his split lip)
                    ...I got a cold sore, I've never got one
                    before. I started crying.
          
                                 SAUL
                    A cold sore? Is that fucking herpes?
          
                                 RED
                    ...uh, yeah, man.

                     (to Dale)
          Okay, Captain Demando. Can you just chill
          out, maybe? So, Red. I gotta ask-
          
                       RED
          Okay, first of all, stop. What's this all
          about? That's what I want to know.
          
                       SAUL
          Alright. Well, Dale's a servant for
          protest lawyers, and-                                
          
                       DALE
          Whoa, whoa! Saul, I don't think...well,
          Red, I don't mean to be rude but I don't
          think we should tell you any more than
          you need to know.
          
                       RED
          Fuck that, Dale. This is my house, I
          deserve to know.
          
                       SAUL
          Dude! Let's just tell him. It is his
          house.
          
                       DALE
          Look. Red, I just don't want to pull you
          into the shit we're in. It's just
          trouble.
          
                       SAUL
          Don't be weird about this. If he wants
          trouble, it's his right to have it.
          
                       RED
          Whoa! Whoa! I don't want trouble.
          
                       DALE
          That's why we only need to clarify one
          thing - nobody's called about Saul or the
          pineapple express or anything like that?
          
                       RED
          No one. Nada.
          
                                                                   46
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Awesome! Look at that! Everything's fine.
                    We had a crazy night in the woods, which             
                    I assume we can both put behind us like              
                    grown ups, and now we can use Red's giant            
                    bong to get super-duper high.                        
          
          Dale doesn't seem convinced. Saul picks up Red's huge          
          bong and starts to pack a bit of Red's weed into it.           
          
                                 RED                                     
                    Alright, well, wicked. Make yourselves at
                    home. I'm just going to use the ol'
                    telephone-o.                                         
          
          Saul sits down and picks up a lighter as Red walks             
          towards the phone. Dale watches Red, suspicious of his         
          odd behavior. Red begins to dial...
          
          SMACK! Dale knocks the phone out of Red's hand.
          
                                 RED (CONT'D)
                    What the fuck!
          
          Saul jumps up. Dale SNATCHES the phone and backs up.
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
          
                                  SAUL
                    Dale!   What the fuck are you doing?
          
                                 DALE
                           (to Saul)
                    We can't let him call anyone! He's acting
                    weird!
          
                                 RED
                    Fuck you man - this is my house!                     
          
                                 DALE
                    I'm sorry. I just, I don't think I can-
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dale! You fucking nut. You're stoned and
                    paranoid. Just chill the shit out, guy!
                           (to Red)                                      
                    I'm sorry, Red. I shouldn't have brought             
                    this guy over here, he's a total lunatic.            
          
          Without warning, Red grabs a LARGE ASHTRAY filled with
          cigarette butts and WHIPS it at Dale. BAM! It smashes him
          in the head!!!
          
                                                                    47
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                           (in pain)
                    AAAHHH!
          
          Ash EXPLODES everywhere as Dale drops the phone and
          clutches his head.
          
                                   SAUL
                    Holy cock!
          
          Red approaches the cowering Dale. Saul intercedes.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Dude! He's sorry! Wait!
          
          Red PUNCHES Saul in the face! Saul SCREAMS and drops to
          the ground.
          
                                   SAUL (CONT'D)
                    WHY!?!?!
          
          Dale snatches the phone and scurries into the bathroom,
          slamming the door behind him.
          
          
          INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Disoriented, Dale scans the small bathroom. Saul and Red
          can be heard fighting outside.
          
                                 SAUL (O.S.)
                    Dude, we're friends, what the fuck is                 
                    wrong with you? Ow! Dude! Are you fucked              
                    off that shit again!?! Ow!                            
          
                                 RED (O.S.)
                    I have to! They'll kill me!!! Please                  
                    don't fight!                                          
          
          A loud CRASH is heard from the other room.
          
                                   SAUL                                   
                    AAAHHHHHH!!!                                          
          
          Dale throws the phone in the toilet bowl and smacks down
          the seat. He runs back to help Saul.
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Red is BEATING the shit out of Saul.
          
                                                                    48
          
          
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    Why, man!?! Why!                                      
          
                                   RED                                    
                    I'M SORRY!!!                                          
          
          Saul manages to stand up when Red boots him in the BALLS!
          He SHRIEKS and stumbles backwards. Dale dashes into the
          room and LEAPS onto Red's back. Red wobbles forward, then       
          starts RUNNING BACKWARDS. He trips on his coffee table
          and CRASHES Dale through it, landing on top of him. Red         
          gets up, sprints into the bathroom and locks the door.
          With great effort, Dale and Saul manage to get up.
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    He's going for the phone! Bathroom!                   
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          Frantically searching for the phone, Red flips the toilet
          seat up and grabs it. He begins to dial as Dale and Saul
          sprint down the hall.
          
          Just as Red is about to finish dialing, Dale and Saul
          CRASH into the bathroom door! They knock it completely
          off it's hinges, SLAMMING it directly into Red! The phone
          flies into the bathtub.
          
                                 DALE
                           (pointing at the phone)
                    SAUL!!! Phone!!!
          
          Saul jumps into the bathtub and begins STOMPING the
          phone. Dale continuously SLAMS his body against the door
          in an attempt to keep Red pinned down.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What the fuck Red!?! What the fuck is
                    going on!?!
          
                                 RED
                    I don't know!!! They're going to kill
                    me!!!
          
                                 SAUL
                    You didn't stub your toe, did you?
          
          Red stops struggling and tries to catch his breath. Dale
          kneels on top of the door, keeping him pinned.
          
                                   DALE
                    Now tell us-
          
                                                                   49
          
          
          
                                 RED
                    They're gonna come back and kill me!!!
          
          In an impressive show of strength, Red shoves the door
          off him, knocking Dale aside. He runs.
          
          
          INT. RED'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul chases Red and TACKLES him into a wall. Dale follows
          seconds later, and notices Red's LARGE GLASS BONG. He
          looks back to see Saul getting pummelled.
          
                                  SAUL                                   
                    DALE! HELP!                                          
          
          Dale grabs the bong and swings around - CRASH!!! It
          shatters on the back of Red's head.
          
          Red falls to the ground moaning, blood dripping from his
          head. Dale and Saul stand over him, out of breath,
          bruised and battered.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                           
                    Red, you motherfucker.
          
          Dale, lost in thought, starts to seriously freak out.
          
                                 DALE
                    It's happening! It's actually happening!
                    He knows my name! Red knows my name!
          
                                 SAUL
                    We should beat it out of his sellout
                    brains. You're a shitty friend, Red! Fuck
                    the Casino! Go alone!
          
                                 DALE
                    This is fucked, what do we do now, he
                    knows my name!?!
          
                                 SAUL
                    He knows my name too!
          
                                 DALE
                    Well what do we do? He's gonna tell them!
          
                                 SAUL
                    We're not gonna have to kill him, are we?
                    I don't think I could do that.
          
          Dale stares at the almost motionless Red.
          
                                                                  50
          
          
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Maybe we could talk him into killing
                    himself, or, like, make him promise not
                    to tell.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well, we have to find out what he knows.
          
                                 RED
                           (in great pain)
                    I don't know anything...you broke my
                    bong...
          
          Dale, trying to act tough, grabs Red by the collar.
          
                                 DALE
                    Tell us everything. Now!
          
          Red looks to Saul for sympathy.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Don't look at me, you sellout bastard.
                    Now start talking!
          
                                 RED
                    I can't...I don't know anything.
          
          Dale pulls Saul aside.
          
                                 SAUL
                    What do we do? He's not gonna talk.
          
                                 DALE
                    I think we beat it out of him.
          
                                   SAUL
                    For real?
          
                                 DALE
                    Okay. Red. Here's the deal: if you don't
                    tell us everything, we're going to beat
                    you up.

                    You've got five seconds, okay? Ready?
                    Five, four-

          Dale raises his fist.
          
                                 RED
                    Please don't.
          
                                 DALE
                    Three, two...one!
          
          Red cringes as Dale softly "punches" his gut. It doesn't
          hurt him.
          
                                 RED
                    That didn't hurt.
          
                                 SAUL

                    man. Like, fucking hit him!
          
          Dale takes a deep breathe and raises his fist.
          
                                 RED

          Dale grabs a potted plant.

          Dale swings the plant back to strike Red. The pot flies      
          off the plant and Dale smashes the dirt covered roots of     
          the plant against Red's face.

          Dale raises his fist.

                    show. They said they'd kill me if I

          Dale swings the PLANT upwards, prepared to strike Red          
          again.

                    calls them the Asians.
          
          Dale and Saul exchange an even more worried look.

                    where his duct tape is.
          
          Saul runs off. Dale puts on Saul's backpack and looks at
          the battered Red moaning on the floor.
          
                                                                    53

                    up.
          
          Dale pulls Red's hands behind his back. Saul is picking
          at the tape.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

          Saul rips open the DUCT TAPE. He quickly BINDS Red's            
          hands and feet. SUDDENLY, there's a KNOCK at the door.          
          They stop, silent. KNOCK. KNOCK. KNOCK. Red starts              
          thrashing and trying to scream.

                    Hey. What skin color were these guys?
          
                                 RED
                    What? Um...white, they're both white. I
                    think Denton might be a Jew, but I
                    couldn't really tell.
          
                                 MATHESON                                
                    You hear that, Ted?

                    Dale Denton. Not Asian. Alright. Kill
                    Red.
          
          Matheson pulls out a gun and shoots Red in the gut.

          TED (the big grey-haired guy) puts his portable phone
          back in its charger.

          The living room windows are covered by black sheets.
          Workers are busy scrubbing blood stains off the floor and       
          walls. The dead Asian man lies on top of bubble-wrap in
          the corner.
          
          Ted walks into the kitchen where CAROL BRAZIER (female
          cop from the murder, in full uniform, mid-30s) is playing
          with her gun.
          
                                 TED (CONT'D)                             
                    Carol, there's another name to run. Dale
                    Denton.
          
                                 CAROL
                    Does he have something to do with our
                    friend in there?
          
                                 TED
                    If the Asians have the balls to send an
                    assassin right into my home, we can't be
                    too cautious. The boys say Denton and
                    Saul are Caucasian. Maybe after their
                    assassin failed, they hired this outside              
                    guy Denton to finish the job.                         
                           (pondering)
                    Also, the boys said that Saul mentioned
                    "going to the casino."
          
                                 CAROL                                    
                    "Going to the casino"? I don't like that.
          
          Carol holsters her gun.

          an eavesdropping tool aimed at   Ted's house. They hear
          every word. One of them writes   down info in Korean.

          Dale and Saul get out of the cab in a pleasant                  
          neighborhood. Saul begrudgingly pays the driver. They           
          walk towards Angie's house.

          Angie opens the door with a smile, the phone in hand. Her
          attention is towards the phone conversation she is

                    - I saw a crooked cop kill a guy while I              
                    was working...this morning. The cop shot              
                    the guy then saw my car drive off, and I              
                    think they might have seen my license                 
                    plate and, so, I ditched my car...in the              
                    woods, so...                                          
          
          They stare at Dale as though he were crazy.

                    I know! Look, we have to get out of here.           
                    I'm sure everything is going to be fine

          Dale and Saul lead Angie and her parents towards the back     
          door.

          Budlofsky and Matheson are now at the front door. They've     
          each got a gun drawn and are preparing to burst in.           
          Budlofsky is loading his bullet cartridge.                    
          
                                                                    64

                    Ready?                                                
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    No. One sec.                                          
          
          Budlofsky puts in the last few bullets.                         
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Hurry the fuck up.                                    
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                                
                    Chill out, man. You're nagging isn't                  
                    helping.                                              
          
          Budlofsky cocks his gun and nods at Matheson.                   
          
          
          INT. ANGIE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
          
          BAM! They kick open the doors and run into her house. No        
          one is there. Budlofsky cautiously walks over to the            
          table and touches the food. It's still warm. Matheson           
          bends down and picks up a bloody fork.                          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Ew! It's a bloody fork! What are these                
                    people doing?

          Dale, Angie, her parents, and Saul burst into the garage.       
          Robert is fumbling with the keys. He manages to open the        
          car. Saul pulls up his shirt to look at the stab wound.

          Ted and Carol are in mid-discussion, and rather
          distraught at that. Behind them two henchmen take the
          dead Asian man's body out the back door.

                    Maybe he killed her, to protect himself.

                    They smashed one and left the other one             
                    in the woods to distract us. Took us an             
                    hour to find it. And we found Denton's              
                    car, which was filled with all these

          Cheung, the leader of the Asians, has a lavish mansion
          which is covered in ornate decorations and expensive
          merchandise. It is immaculately clean and organized.
          Several armed men with earpieces stand in strategic
          locations throughout the house. Cheung is reading a
          Korean book alone in his study. The phone rings and he
          picks it up.

          Cheung sits up, shocked to have his opponent calling him.
          He snaps his fingers and two guards run in. He covers the
          phone.

                    Ted. This is surprising. What would you
                    like?

                    Cheung, I want you to call off your man
                    Denton. I don't know what he is, a scout,
                    assassin, and frankly I don't care. I
                    just want him gone. I want him dead. If
                    you do this, I'll consider it a peace
                    offering, otherwise, you're asking for
                    war. And just in case you forgot, I'm
                    number one, and there's a reason for
                    that. You've got 24 hours to reply.

                    Ted Jones is slipping. Our assassin                  
                    failed to kill him, but it did rattle his            
                    confidence. It's earlier than planned,               
                    but we should strike now, while he is

          EXT. PARK - NIGHT
          
          Dale and Saul are sitting in the branches of a tree. Fast      
          food wrappers lie scattered. Saul is rolling a joint.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Victory joint complete. Here ya go.
          
          Saul passes it to Dale, who lights it. Dale takes another
          puff and starts to seriously relax. A smile creeps across
          his face as he passes the joint to Saul.
          
                                 DALE
                    "Tell us what you know!" How fuckin'
                    balls was that?
          
          Saul takes a puff.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Like, really balls.
          
                                 DALE
                    And I think I fought pretty well, don't
                    you? You know, for my first time. We were
                    like Tango and Cash, man.
          
                                   SAUL

                    BOOM! Knocked the door right off it's
                    hinges!
          
          Saul passes the joint to Dale.
          
                                 SAUL
                    And you probably saved Angie, which is
                    fucking pimp.

                    I probably couldn't have done it without
                    you. Thanks, man. It is fucking pimp.

                    know.
          
          Saul passes the joint to Dale.
          
                                  DALE
                    Thanks, man.

                    You know, my last dealer was a total
                    dick. You're by far the coolest dealer
                    I've ever had.

                                 DALE
                    Yeah...like, the time before last time, I          
                    totally had weed. I just kind of wanted            
                    to chill with you.                                 
          
                                 SAUL
                           (over-joyed)
                    Really? That's awesome, man. That means a          
                    lot to me, `cause, like, plenty of dudes           
                    come in to buy and pretend to be all
                    buddy-buddy with me, but in my head I'm
                    always, like, "you don't like me, you
                    like my drugs, so fuck you, buddy!" You
                    know? And just so you know, I totally              
                    could have lit that cross-joint on my
                    own. I'd just have to use candles, but,
                    like, I've never smoked one of those with
                    anyone before.                                     
          
          Dale passes Saul the joint.                                  
          
                                 DALE
                    So, do you think we should leave town? We          
                    could just get on a bus and go, right?
          
                                 SAUL
                    We only have, like, fifty bucks. I don't
                    think that could even pay for one ticket.
          
          Saul rubs the roach out in the dirt.
          
                                                                 70

          Saul rubs his balls again.
          
                                 SAUL

          Blake passes the joint to Dale.

                    Alright gentlemen, it's time for me to
                    teach you some business. Brass tacs -
                    this is the best weed you've ever smoked,
                    agreed?
          
          The kids all nod in agreement.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    So I'm gonna make this simple. How much
                    did you get between you?
          
                                 BLAKE
                    A hundred and seventy eight.
          
          Saul pulls out his impressive bag of weed. The kids GASP.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Alright. You gimme all your money, you
                    can each take two handfuls of weed. That
                    treat ya right?
          
          The kids cheer as Desmond takes two BIG handfuls.
          
                                 DESMOND
                    That's fucking awesome!
          
                                 SAUL
                    I know. Keep it on the down low.
          
          They pay Dale and take their weed. Happy as hell, they
          run off, stuffing HANDFULS OF WEED into their pockets.
          
                                 ACK
                           (to Walt)
                    Jason'll never believe this...until I
                    show him all this weed!
          
          Dale holds the un-lit joint as Saul takes the pot and the
          money.
          
                                 SAUL
                    And we, my good man, are officially scott
                    fuckin' free.

                                 DALE
                    There are still people trying to kill us.          
          
                                 SAUL
                    But at least now we can afford to run.
                    I'm gonna go buy some celebration snacks.
                    Let's have us a little mardi-gras                  
                    fiesta.
          
          Saul laughs as he puts on his backpack and walks around
          the corner. Dale re-lights the remaining roach and           
          casually smokes. He blows some smoke rings, coughs a bit,
          stretches; for a few moments, looking completely relaxed,
          but then-
          
          A COP CAR screeches to a halt right in front of Dale! A
          female POLICE LIAISON OFFICER (who is not Carol) gets out
          of the car. Dale freezes in horror.
          
                                  POLICE LIAISON
                    Don't move!
          
          She walks towards Dale. He seems prepared to run, but she
          places her hand on a can of pepper spray.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON (CONT'D)
                    Don't move! This stuff hurts. What's in
                    your hand?
          
                                 DALE.
                    I'm sorry, Ma'am. It's weed. I'll get rid
                    of it right away, I was just smoking
                    this. I...I thought it was
                    decriminalized. Or something. For medical
                    purposes. I have epilepsy.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Selling pot to my students isn't
                    "decriminalized." I'm the liaison officer
                    for this school and I just caught four
                    students showing off handfuls of
                    marijuana to their friends. They told me
                    they got it back here. Put your hands up.
          
          She cuffs Dale's hands behind him!
          
                                 DALE
                    Wait! I wasn't selling anything! All I
                    have is this little joint.
          
          
          Police Liaison takes the large joint out of Dale's hand.
          
                                                                    75
          
          
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    You call this little?
          
          She throws it on the ground and smears it around with her
          foot.
          
                                 DALE
                    I don't even have any money! How did I
                    sell weed if I don't have any money?!? I
                    was just smoking it. I swear. Please.
          
          She pats him down, finding only his wallet. The Police
          Liaison sees he only has nine dollars. She pulls out his
          DRIVER'S LICENSE.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    It's possible you're telling the truth.
                    I'm going to run a check and if it turns
                    out you don't have any priors and all
                    you've got is this small amount of
                    marijuana, I'll let you go with a fine.
                    Take a seat.
          
          She walks towards her car as Dale sits on the ground.
          
          ANGLE ON: Saul
          
          Saul merrily turns into the alley holding TWO RED
          SLURPEES, when he jumps back in terror! He sees the cop         
          car up the alley. He ducks back behind the corner.
          
                                 SAUL
                    They got Dale. Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh
                    fuck...
          
          ANGLE ON: Dale and the Police Liaison
          
          She looks at her car computer. The screen reads:
          
          DALE DENTON: OUTSTANDING WARRANT - DOUBLE HIT AND RUN.
          
          She looks back at Dale and types into her computer.
          
          
          INT. CAROL'S COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          We see Carol (who is in fact Ted's evil accomplice)
          speeding down the road. Her police computer beeps. She
          looks at the screen.
          
                                 CAROL
                           (smiling)
                    Denton.

          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
          
          The Police Liaison stuffs Dale in the back of her squad
          car.
          
                                 DALE
                    What is this for? What did that thing
                    tell you? What did I do?
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Hit and run, Mr. Denton. A double,
                    actually. You hit two parked cars two
                    nights ago.
          
          A look of crippling horror comes across Dale's face as
          she throws him in the back seat and slams his door shut.
          
          ANGLE ON: Saul
          
          He peaks down the alley and sees Dale in the back of the
          car and the FEMALE Police Liaison getting in the front.
          
                                 SAUL
                    The lady cop. She's gonna kill him.
          
          The car slowly makes a three point turn.
          
          
          INT. COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
                                 DALE
                    You don't understand! You have to let me
                    go! Dirty cops are gonna kill me! Please!
          
          The Police Liaison ignores Dale.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    This...this lady cop, and these guys                  
                    Budlofsky and Matheson, they all work for

                           (suddenly interested)
                    Ted Jones?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. With grey-hair. Tell me you know
                    what I'm talking about. He lives near
                    Evergreen Heights. He-

                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Are you telling me you saw Ted Jones and
                    a police office shoot someone?
          
                                 DALE
                    Yeah. An Asian someone.
          
          The Police Liaison ponders as she finishes her three
          point turn and drives toward the exit of the alley.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Stay calm, do as your told, I'll get you
                    down to the station.
          
                                 DALE
                           (ecstatic)
                    Yes ma'am.
          
          
          EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul peeks out and sees the approaching cop car. He looks
          at the two red slurpees and thinks, then suddenly jumps
          out and THROWS himself onto the hood of the cop car!
          
          The Police Liaison and Dale see a body SLAM against the
          car and RED LIQUID SPLATTER everywhere, covering the
          windshield. They SCREAM.
          
          WHAM! In the impact, we clearly see Saul's BALLS getting
          ROCKED on the car! The Police Liaison slams on the
          brakes, causing Dale to SMASH into the metal cage.
          
                                 POLICE LIAISON
                    Oh my god! Is that blood? Oh my god!
          
          She puts the car in park. As the Police Liaison gets out
          of her car, Saul can be seen crawling around the back of
          the vehicle, clutching his testicles. The frightened
          Police Liaison looks at the windshield.
          
          She notices the two slurpee cups on the ground and
          quickly turns around. She sees Saul jumping into the
          drivers seat.
          
          Saul sees a SHOTGUN beside the passenger seat. The Police
          Liaison reaches for her GUN!
          
                                 DALE
                    NO! What are you doing!?!
          
                                                                    78

                    Freeze mister! Don't even...
          
          Saul slams the car into reverse! He speeds backwards up
          the alley as the Police Liaison runs after them - GUN
          DRAWN!
          
                                 DALE
                    No! She was going to help us!
          
                                 SAUL
                           (in pain)
                    Oh...my balls...I seriously think I
                    popped one...
          
          Suddenly, Carol (the cop from Ted's house) whips her COP
          CAR into the alley! WHAM!!! It smashes into the rear of
          their car! Dale turns around and establishes eye contact
          with the stunned Carol.
          
                                 DALE
                           (horrified)
                    IT'S HER! The lady cop!
          
          Saul slams down the gas! Through the slurpee covered
          window Saul sees the Police Liaison rushing towards them.
          
                                 SAUL
                           (motion at the Police
                            Liaison)
                    Then who's that?
          
          The Police Liaison raises her gun.
          
                 SAUL (CONT'D)                      DALE
          NOOOO!!!                      AAAAH!!!
          
          BLAM! She fires and the bullet punches through the              
          windshield! The Police Liaison dives to the side as they        
          zoom past her! They burst out of the alley. A moment
          later, Carol follows, in hot pursuit.
          
          
          I/E. DALE AN SAUL'S STOLEN COP CAR - CONTINUOUS
          
          The car weaves through traffic.
          
                                 SAUL
                    The slurpee! I can't see!
          
                                                                    79
          
          
          
                                 DALE
                    Turn on the wipers!
          
          Saul mindlessly starts grasping at switches in the car.
          He finally turns on the wipers, which wipe away the
          slurpee and reveal that the window is so badly cracked he
          still can't see through it. Carol's car emerges right           
          behind them.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dude, I seriously can't see!
          
                                 DALE
                    Kick out the window! Isn't that what they
                    do?
          
                                 SAUL
                    I don't know. Okay.
          
          Saul, with great effort, keeps one foot on the pedals
          and, with all his might, kicks his other leg through the
          front window. His leg PUNCHES straight through the glass,
          but he can't pull it back in!
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Oh fuck! Shit!
          
                                 DALE
                    Get it out of there!
          
          Suddenly, their car gets jerked to the side.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Ah! Ah! My leg!
          
          Carol is ramming them from behind.
          
                                 DALE
                           (hysterical)
                    She's following us! She's gaining on us!
          
                                 SAUL
                    Her car's better!
          
          Saul yanks at his leg and manages to wriggle it out of
          the hole. He begins to accelerate and realizes he can see
          where he's going through the hole.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)
                    Ha! I can see! Through my leg hole!
          
          Saul bumps over the curb and cuts through a LARGE PARK.
          Carol is right behind them.
          
                                                                    80
          
          
          
                                  DALE
                     Do something!
          
          Saul thinks hard, then buckles his seat belt.
          
                                  SAUL
                     Hold on. I've got an idea.
          
          Dale does what little he can to brace himself. Saul SLAMS
          on the breaks. Carol sees Saul screeching to a halt and         
          slams on her breaks. She grunts and whips out her GUN.          
          Both cars come to a full stop beside one another.               
          
          She opens fire - BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! - Bullets
          rip through the stolen cruiser. Shattered glass flies
          everywhere. Dale and Saul desperately duck for cover.
          
          Saul hits the gas and the bullet riddled car takes off.
          Carol follows.
          
                                  DALE
                     WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT?!?!?
          
          Saul pops back up and begins steering again.
          
                                  SAUL
                     Oh shit, man! I'm sorry! I thought she'd
                     keep going.
          
          The car bumps back on to a main road. Carol follows,
          sirens blaring.
          
                                  DALE
                     Turn on the sirens!
          
          Saul's hand flails around, grasping everything. He feels
          the SHOTGUN and accidentally pulls the trigger-
          
          BOOM! The blast blows through the roof of the car and
          hits an overhead TRAFFIC LIGHT - shredding it to pieces!
          
                      SAUL                          DALE
          JESUS!!!                         SHIT!
          
          Carol flies into the intersection on a collision course
          with Saul and Dale.
          
          CRUNCH! A car smashes into the side of the Carol's
          cruiser.
          
          As Dale and Saul speed off, Carol emerges from the
          smoking wreckage, a look of hate in her eyes.
          
                                                                    81
          
          
          
          
          EXT. QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET - MOMENTS LATER
          
          The stolen cruiser screeches to a halt and Saul hops out.
          
                                 SAUL
                    Run!
          
          He starts running up the block at top speed.
          
          Dale, still handcuffed in the back of the cruiser, starts
          thrashing and screaming.
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul! Saul! I'm locked in!
          
          Dale continues to scream as Saul obliviously bolts to the
          end of the block and just keeps going.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                    You dumb fucking fuck!!! HELP ME!!!
          
          Dale sits in the car, helpless. He has a look of utter
          disbelief on his face. After a moment of silence he
          starts wildly kicking the door window. He soon gives up.
          
          Just then, Dale notices Saul, over a block away, running
          back towards the stolen car. Saul soon arrives,
          completely out of breath, and opens the door.
          
                                 SAUL
                    So... huff ... huff ...fuckin'
                    sorry... huff ...forgot...
          
          Dale flops out of the car and onto the grass. Saul tries
          to help him to his feet, but Dale pulls away.
          
                                 DALE
                    Don't touch me, you asshole!
          
          Dale wiggles to his feet runs for it. Saul follows.
          
          
          INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY                                       
          
          Dale and Saul enter the hardware store, walking very            
          close together so that no one sees Dale is handcuffed.          
          They receive a few odd looks as they search and locate          
          what they are looking for: saws. Saul quickly finds a           
          sturdy looking hack-saw.                                        
          
                                                                    82

                    fast. Bend over.                                      
          
          Dale gets on his knees and bends over, pressing his face        
          up against the wall. Saul begins to manically hack away         
          at the cuffs.                                                   
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Ow! Ow! Hurry!

          Suddenly, Saul sees a store clerk coming and shoves the         
          saw underneath Dale's suit jacket.                              
          
                                 DALE                                     
                    Which saw do you like most?                           
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    The brown ones nice, but the metallic                 
                    ones seems more...                                    
          
          They watch the clerk walk off and immediately return to         
          sawing the handcuffs.

          Dale stretches his arms. The handcuffs are still on his         
          hands, but no longer attached.

                    Angie, no! No! Don't you get it? I was              
                    thrown into this situation, I had no                
                    control, but I am dealing with it. This             
                    kind of thing happens, you know-

                    that you think you're some kind of
                    fucking genius just makes it a hundred

          As Dale walks out of his phone booth, we see that Saul is    
          on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a    
          pipe.

                    Yo, so before we go on the lamb I gotta            
                    go see my grandma, okay? She was worried           
                    `cause I didn't show up to help with the           
                    locks. But before that I've got to smoke           
                    another bowl.

                    smoke marijuana?
          
                                 SAUL

                    How can you smoke marijuana after what we
                    just went through? That clearly happened
                    because we were smoking marijuana.
          
                                 SAUL
                    No. It happened because those fucking
                    kids didn't keep that shit on the down
                    low. Which is weird, `cause they really            
                    seemed like cool kids.

                    When I saved you with those Slurpees I
                    was stoned. What do you gotta say to
                    that? Maybe the pot is what gave me the
                    creative capacity to come up with such a
                    great plan! The Beatles were high!

          MUSIC UP: THE END by THE DOORS
          
          - Saul gets on a bus and sits down, sad and deject.           
          
          - Dale sits against the phone booth, crying like a baby.      
          He buries his hands in his pocket and pulls out his baggy     
          of weed. He hurls it away. He gets up to retrieve it.         
          
          - Saul is in a really shitty fast food restaurant, nearly     
          crying as he eats his burger and fries.                       
          
          - Dale stares at a joint in his hands, thinks for a           
          moment, and then, crying profusely, lights it and starts
          smoking.
          
          A solitary tear rolls down his cheek and drips directly
          onto the tip of the joint, putting it out. Dale hears the
          sizzle and looks at the joint. He continues crying. He        
          puts the joint down, beside three large roaches.              
          
          - Walking down the street, Saul sees the Point Grey           
          Retirement Home.                                              
          
          - Dale feverishly looks through the phone book. He finds      
          what he's looking for: Belogus.                               
          
          - Saul, hiding behind a bush across the street, surveys       
          the retirement home. Seeing the coast is clear, he walks
          towards the entrance. As Saul enters the building,            
          Budlofksy and Matheson pull up.

          Saul casually walks into the lobby. The elderly residents

          Saul turns and sees an ELDERLY WOMAN.

                    Hey! Mrs. Mendelson!
          
          Saul peers over her shoulder and sees Budlofsky and           
          Matheson walk in!

          Saul runs for it, and they chase after him. He maneuvers        
          through the elderly like a pylon course, the thugs right        
          on his ass. He bursts into another room.                        
          
          
          INT. CAFFETERIA - CONTINUOUS                                    
          
          He tears through the room, filled with old people eating.       
          Budlofsky and Matheson pursue him.                              
          
          
          INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                       
          
          As Saul runs through the hall, Budlofksy and Matheson           
          appear.                                                         
          
                                   MATHESON                               
                    Eat it!                                               
          
          Matheson whip out his gun and fires - BLAM! The bullet          
          whizzes past Saul and two elderly men, who don't even           
          flinch, and then shatters a distant window. Saul turns          
          the corner and-                                                 
          
          BAM! He slams into someone, sending the person crashing         
          to the ground.                                                  
          
                                 INJURED PERSON                           
                    OW! Shit...ow, ow, ow!                                
          
          Saul looks, terrified he's hurt an old person, but sees         
          it is a young male nurse. He runs for it and sees an open       
          door with chatter coming from inside. He runs into-             
          
          
          INT. TEA ROOM - CONTINUOUS
          
          A dead end! Several startled OLD WOMEN look up from their
          Majong. One of them instantly recognizes Saul-
          
                                 MRS. CORBER
                    Solly Silver?!?
          
                                 SAUL
                    Mrs. Corber! You gotta hide me!
          
          The Budlofsky and Matheson bursts into the room. Saul           
          looks around, sees a teapot and grabs it. He hurls it at        
          Matheson and nails him in the face. The tea pot shatters        
          and hot water pours all over his face and hand.                 
          
                                                                    89
          
          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    AHH!!! FUCK!!!                                        
          
          Budlofsky GRABS Saul and knees him in the balls.                
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                           (wheezing)                                     
                    NOOO!!!
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    Yeah!                                                 
          

          Budlofsky punches Saul in the face.                             
          
          CUT TO BLACK

          Dale hustles towards the entrance of the building when he       
          sees several police cars parked outside, their lights           
          flashing.                                                       
          
          He sees a bunch of old people gathered on the front lawn.       
          Doing his best to avoid the cops, he joins the cluster of       
          elderly.                                                        
          
                                 OLD WOMAN                                
                    Oh, god this is terrible. Poor Faye.                  
                    Poor, poor Faye.

                    Hey, uh, what's going on here?                        
          
                                 OLD MAN                                  
                    It just happened.

                    What did?                                             
          
                                 OLD WOMAN                                
                    Faye Belogus' grandson was kidnapped from             
                    right inside the building. We all saw it.             
                    They fought in the majong room and hurt               
                    the new nurse, Stefan.                                
          
          Dale is terrified.                                              
          
                                   DALE                                   
                    Uh...thanks.

                    If I was there, I would've kicked an ass.             
          
                                                                 90
          
          
          
          Dale looks, circle of people comforting a crying old         
          woman, clearly Faye Belogus. He walks over.                  
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    Mrs. Belogus. I wouldn't worry, Saul's             
                    going to be fine.                                  
          
          Dale walks off, determined.                                  
          
          
          INT. THE BARN - SOON AFTER                                   
          
          Saul wakes up but can't see anything. From his POV we see    
          tape get ripped off his eyes and mouth.                      
          
                                   SAUL                                
                    ARRGGGHHH!!!                                       
          
          Saul sees a BUDLOFSKY wielding a knife. He struggles and     
          realizes that his arms and legs are bound. Saul closes       
          his eyes, assuming he's about to die.
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                         
                           (whispers to himself)
                    Fuck. I regret everything.                         
          
          BUDLOFSKY cuts the tape away from Saul's legs.               
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                           
                    Get up.
          
          Saul gets up and hops out of the car. He looks around and    
          see that he is in a LARGE BARN. Saul notices SIX THUGS       
          talking as they move bricks of weed and cocaine into a       
          van.                                                         
          
          Matheson appears and looks at Saul with smoldering           
          hatred. Saul sees that his face and neck were burnt from     
          the tea and the broken shards of pot cut his cheek.          
          
                                 SAUL                                  
                    Oh fuck. That looks painful.                       
          
          Matheson walks over, lowers to one knee, and punches him     
          straight in the balls.                                       
          
                                   SAUL (CONT'D)                       
                    EEEHH!!!                                           
          
          Matheson whips out his gun and shoves it in Saul's mouth.    
          Budlofsky taps Matheson on the shoulder.                     
          
                                                                    91
          
          
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY                                
                    Don't. Ted wants him.                                 
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Fine.                                                 
          
          Matheson looks at the wheezing Saul, curled over by his         
          feet, and punches him in the back of the head.                  
          
          Matheson pokes Saul in the back with his gun, ushering          
          him towards the corner of the barn. They come to an old         
          TRAP DOOR. Matheson opens the hatch and they descend.           
          
          
          INT. UNDERGROUND FACILITY - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul is led along a narrow tunnel. As they reach the end,       
          Saul's eyes go wide. He enters the same massive metal           
          room that the government used in the 30s (at the                
          beginning of the movie)...only now it is rather worn
          down, and filled with HUNDREDS OF HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS.
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                           (breath-taken)
                    El Dorado.
          
          Matheson urges Saul through the dense forest of weed,           
          passing several of Ted's thugs, the hum of the giant grow       
          lights filling the air.                                         
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)                            
                    Dude, look at all this weed.                          
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Shut the fuck up and keep moving.                     
          
          As Matheson ushers Saul through the foliage, Saul notices       
          a strange suit that resembles an old fashioned scuba            
          diving uniform (the one from the 1930s intro) hanging on        
          a wall.

                    What the hell is that?                                
          
          They arrive at a door. Matheson opens it and shoves Saul        
          in, causing him to almost trip.                                 
          
                                 SAUL (CONT'D)

          It is the same room Private Miller was in. Matheson shuts       
          the door.

                                 DALE                                     
                    Hello? Anyone here? Red?                              
          
          Dale starts looking around. He hears music and then sees        
          he's stepping in a pool of blood.                               
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)                            
                    Oh my god.                                            
          
          Dale follows the music into the bathroom.                       
          
          
          INT. RED'S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS                                
          
          Dale enters and is shocked to see Red lying on the floor,       
          clenching his bloody gut with one hand and a joint and          
          beer in the other. The music is coming from a small boom        
          box.

          Red turns toward Dale and picks up a kitchen knife with         
          his bloody hand.

          Red drops the knife and then takes a puff of his joint          
          and a sip of his beer.

          Red takes a hit and coughs. It clearly brings terrible          
          pain to his bullet wound.

          Red heroic-ish-ly rises from the floor. He hobbles over         
          to the hall and opens a cabinet on the wall. Dale looks         
          in and sees several hand guns inside.

          Dale and Red are in Red's car, a FORD FIESTA, driving           
          through the countryside. Dale stops the car 100 yards           
          from the barn.

          Red gets out and walks to the drivers side. Dale gets         
          out, gun in hand. Red gets in the drivers seat.

                    an automatic weapon, zig zag. It makes

          Red drives off. Dale takes a deep breath, clenches his        
          gun, and starts cautiously moving towards the barn. He        
          checks to make sure his safety is off and he's ready to       
          fight. Dale sneaks up on the building and pears in            
          between two boards. He sees Budlofsky supervising as the      
          thugs load the van.

          Dale does a jumping role into the burn and then quickly         
          scampers to his feet and puts a gun to THUG 1's head.

          Two of the thugs grab Dale and punch him several times.         
          
                                 BUDLOFSKY (CONT'D)                       
                    Throw him in with the other guy, and                  
                    everyone stay alert. Jared, go watch                  
                    outside. This is fucked up. Somethings                
                    going down.                                           
          
          The thugs start bringing Dale towards the hatch. Suddenly       
          one of them motions for the other to stop, feeling              
          something on Dale's back.                                       
          
                                 THUG 3                                   
                    I think he's got a gun.                               
          
                                   BUDLOFSKY                              
                    What?                                                 
          
          Thug 3 lifts up Dale's shirt, revealing that he has taped       
          a gun to his back.                                              
          
                                                                 96

                    I had to try.                                      
          
          The thugs bring him down the trap door.

          Saul is sitting against the wall with his hands bound and    
          a look of complete defeat. Suddenly, the door opens and      
          Dale is tossed in by Budlofsky.                              
          
                                 SAUL
                    Dale!?! What the fuck? Did you rat me
                    out, you shitty bastard? That what
                    happened?
          
                                 DALE
                    No! I came here to save you!                       
          
                                 SAUL
                    To save me? Ha! That's rich! You're                
                    caught, too. And now I have to die with            
                    some asshole.                                      
          
                                 DALE
                    Saul, I deserved that, because I fucked            
                    you. You're right, this whole things my            
                    fault, and they only way I can make it up          
                    to you is by rescuing you, and that's why          
                    I'm here. To save my friend.                       
          
                                 SAUL
                    Tell ya what, Dale. You actually save me           
                    and I'll consider forgiving you for this           
                    mad shit.                                          
          
                                 DALE                                  
                    Good. `Cause I will.                               
          
                                                                    97
          
          
          
                                 SAUL
                    Oh really? What, you forget to tell me
                    you shoot lasers out of your eyes, or you
                    got some kind of secret blowtorch
                    strapped to your dick? We're not gonna
                    escape, Dale, we're losers, and sinners,
                    and after we die, we're gonna go to hell!
          
                                 DALE
                    We're not losers! We did that car chase.
                    That was all you, man! You got away from
                    the cops. I've watched, like, nine
                    billion hours of worlds wildest police
                    chases and I've never seen a guy get
                    away. Not once! But you did it. You did
                    the impossible.
          
          Suddenly, they both hear someone coming. The door opens.
          Matheson pokes his head, and gun, in.                           
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    We can hear you out there, and it's
                    annoying. Shut the fuck up.
          
          He looks Dale and Saul up and down, then shuts the door.
          Dale sits down and thinks, but is disturbed by his belt
          buckle, which is digging into his gut.
          
                                 DALE                                     
                           (whispering)
                    Perfect! Now rub your wrists against my
                    belt! My belt buckle'll cut the tape. Do
                    it! This is it!
          
          Saul is hesitant, but awkwardly gets in position anyway.
          
                                   DALE (CONT'D)
                             (whispering)
                    Hurry!
          
          In an unavoidably sexual-looking motion, Saul begins to
          gyrate against Dale's belt buckle.
          
                                 DALE (CONT'D)
                           (hushed)
                    Yes! Yes! You know what this is called,               
                    Saul? This is called saving you.

          men. The acknowledge they understand. He holds up a             
          flashlight and flashes three times. From the opposing

          Dale and Saul are still "humping" away.
          
                                 DALE
                    This isn't working. Turn around. I'm
                    using my mouth.
          
          Dale drops to his knees and starts gnawing at the tape on
          Saul's hands. Suddenly, they hear approaching footsteps.
          
                                 SAUL

                           (whispering)
                    Yo - if I cough, I'm going to make a
                    move, if I cough twice, you take the                  
                    lead. Got it?

                    What? No! What if you actually cough?
          
          Dale stands up just as Matheson walks in, gun drawn. Dale       
          looks at Saul and notices that he's managed to free his
          hands.
          
          Dale COUGHS TWICE. Saul shoots him a worried look and
          shakes his head. Matheson notices. Saul COUGHS TWICE.           
          Dale shoots him a confused look. Saul motions at him and
          COUGHS TWICE MORE.
          
                                 MATHESON                                 
                    Hey man, whatever you're doing, I get it,
                    okay? So just stop it, alright? Just cut
                    it-
          
          DALE CHARGES DIRECTLY AT MATHESON!!!                            
          
          BLAM! Matheson shoots at Dale's head! Dale falls to the         
          ground, specks of blood hitting Saul as he dives
          forwards, TACKLING Matheson into the wall!                      
          
          The Matheson's gun slides across the room, hitting Dale's       
          motionless body. Saul scrambles for the gun and grabs it.
          Matheson gets to his feet. Saul turns and-                      
          
          BLAM! He shoots Matheson in the gut.                            
          
                                                                   100

          Dale's motionless body. Horrified, he flips Dale over...
          
          He's alive! The top of his left ear has been blown off!

          Behind Saul, Matheson tries to stand up, but immediately     
          falls back down.

                    and I`ve killed two bad guys already.                 
          
          Saul looks to the vent in the middle of the room. Dale          
          looks at the pipe, sizes up Saul and himself, and takes a       
          deep breath.

                    You'll never be able to pull me up, but               
                    I'll boost you up there and you just                  
                    fucking run for it, man.

                    What? No fucking way, Dale. What about                
                    you?                                                  
          
          Dale cocks his gun.                                             
          
                                 DALE

          Saul tucks the gun in his belt and awkwardly climbs atop        
          Dale's shoulders and tears the vent off.

          Saul lifts himself in. SUDDENLY, Dale sees Ted enter the     
          room and immediately go for his gun.

                    Wha-
          
          Dale walks out from under Saul, raises his gun, and          
          unloads - RATA-TAT-TAT!!! Ted ducks as the plants around     
          him are torn asunder. Dale runs out of ammo.                 
          
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! Ted shoots at Saul, who narrowly avoids    
          the gunfire as he pulls himself into the vent. Ted           
          redirects his attention to Dale, who is running through
          the bushes. Ted blasts off a few shots before Dale
          vanishes into the foliage.

          Saul wiggles his way through the vent. He turns a corner
          and-
          
                                   SAUL
                    AHHH!!!
          
          There is a skeleton wedged in the vent. A grate leading
          out is directly above the corpse. Saul squeamishly crawls
          over the skeleton.

          EXT. OPEN FIELD - CONTINUOUS
          
          Thirty feet from the barn there is an air vent sticking
          out of the ground. The top flies off and Saul emerges. He
          flops onto the ground, then immediately scampers to his
          and pulls out his gun. Saul looks to the open road to
          freedom, then back at the barn.

          Dale frantically runs through the rows of plants, when       
          SUDDENLY he sees the strange scuba suit out of the corner    
          of his eye and swings his gun at it, nearly opening fire.    
          
                                 DALE

          Dale slows down to catch his breath, staring at the          
          strange scuba suit. Then, he gets an idea.                   
          
          ANGLE ON: Ted, quietly walking through the room              
          
          Ted raises his gun as he spins around a corner.

          Ted turns another corner and sees the strange scuba suit.    
          He starts to walk past it, when he stops himself. He         
          creeps back and looks at it, suspicious. He walks closer,    
          breathing as quietly as he can, his gun clenched tightly.    
          He slowly reaches his hand out to lift the face-hatch. He    
          gently takes hold of the latch and is about to open it,      
          when-                                                        
          
          Dale jumps out from behind him and swings a FIRE             
          EXTINGUISHER at Ted's face - SLAM!!! Ted drops his gun as    
          he falls to the floor.

          EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS
          
          Saul inches towards the barn, hearing a melee of gunfire     
          and screams as he nears it. He cautiously peers in and       
          watches as Carol shoots an assassin in the chest then        
          spins around and shoots at another assassin who              
          desperately runs with a METAL BRIEFCASE handcuffed to his    
          wrist. Carol hits him several times; he lurches over and     
          falls through the trap door. She smiles and drops her
          empty gun.                                                   
          
          Saul watches Carol as she heads towards the trap door. He
          takes a deep breath and CHARGES into the barn, unleashing    
          a barrage of bullets at her! BLAM BLAM BLAM! CLICK.
          
                                                                   107
          
          
          CLICK. CLICK. None of the bullets hit her. She turns and
          sees Saul, who drops his empty gun.
          
                                 SAUL                                     
                    Fuck tha po-lice.
          
          They both SCREAM in rage and CHARGE, fists flying as they
          collide. Carol whips Saul around by his collar and hurls        
          him to the ground. She runs up and kicks him in the gut,        
          time and time again.

          Saul leaps to his feet and PUNCHES Carol in the face. He        
          PUNCHES her again. She reaches for her mace, so Saul            
          kicks her in the groin and grabs it for himself, then           
          sprays her in the face.                                         
          
          SLAM! He punches her in the face.

          Ted and Dale are squared off. Both are bloody lipped and        
          bruised. Dale continuously shucks and jives on the spot         
          as they talk.

          Ted rips off his shirt, revealing dozens of fearsome            
          tattoos and scars. Dale quickly picks a grow light up off       
          the ground. Ted does the same. The humming of the grow          
          lights is heard as the two men walk in a circle, squared        
          off.

          They both swing and their grow lights collide, sending          
          shards of glass everywhere.

          a plank of wood. SMASH! He shatters it over her head.

          Ted and Dale grapple violently on the ground. His gut          
          jiggles as he lunges forwards, punching Dale in the
          throat! Dale falls to his knees, gasping for air. Ted
          kicks him in the head and picks up his GUN.

          Barely alive, the Asian Assassin with the briefcase drags      
          himself down the corridor and enters the grow room. He         
          opens the briefcase and we see that it is a bomb. The          
          assassin inserts a key.                                        
          
          Ted stands over Dale, aims the gun to his head, and-
          
          KA-BOOM!!! THE BRIEFCASE EXPLODES!!!. Flames sweep over        
          the room as Dale rolls for cover. Ted gets blasted back.

          incredible force. Saul and Carol get blown back as Red's       
          Ford Fiesta is sent flying up in the air. The flaming car      
          lands DIRECTLY on Carol and explodes. The entire barn is

          The air thick with weed smoke, Dale slowly rises to his
          feet. He sees Ted slumped against the wall, dead,
          partially aflame. Dale walks over to Ted's body and takes      
          the gun out of his hand.

          He pulls a small BLUE ENVELOPE out of his pocket and
          drops it on Ted.

          Dale turns to see the exit blocked by a wall of fire. The       
          air is thick with smoke and he can barely breath. Dale          
          looks around desperately. He spots the FIRE EXTINGUISHER.       
          He looks at the flames. He takes a deep breath, picks up        
          the fire extinguisher, hurls it with all his might at the       
          fire, and then quickly whips out his gun and shoots at          
          it!                                                             
          
          BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He hits the extinguisher and it               
          explodes, blasting out the fire in the hallway towards          
          the barn. Dale runs like hell.                                  
          
          As he bolts down the hallway, the flames rush back in and       
          chase after him.

          The barn starts to buckle, when Dale suddenly leaps out         
          of the trap door, flames licking his heels. Coughing
          profusely, Dale stands in the barn, then realizes his           
          pants are on fire.

          He starts to walk out of the barn when he suddenly trips        
          over someone.

          He grabs one of the unconscious Saul's feet and starts to       
          drag him out of the barn. Just a they exit, the barn            
          COLLAPSES in on itself, crumbling into a massive heap of        
          burning wood. Dale pulls Saul onto the grass. Saul starts
          coughing.

          emerges, lightly crisped with his clothes on fire. He

          They walk together in silence, delighted at their new
          prospects. After a brief moment, Saul suddenly seems
          afraid. He starts nervously looking back towards the
          barn.
          
                                 SAUL

          Dale motions at his wounded ear.
          
                                 DALE
                    All I hear is ringing.

                    don't know...like, there might be someone

          Dale starts getting nervous, but tries to hide it.
          
                                 DALE
                    Well...the barn did collapse in a ball of
                    fire, and we probably each inhaled about
                    ten pounds of weed smoke, so...it's just,
                    you know-
          
          Dale suddenly looks over his shoulder, but sees nothing.

FADE IN:

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

A gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the
FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo,
almost under her breath.

                     YOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.)
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me
           Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life
           for me...

Suddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the Winged
Victory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought,
the H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-five
gun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

ELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow
railing, gazing at the seas, still singing --

                     ELIZABETH
           ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho...

JOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather,
clutches her shoulder, startling her.

                     GIBBS
               (sotto)
           Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail
           these waters. You want to call
           'em down on us?

Elizabeth stares wide-eyed at him.

                        NORRINGTON
           Mr. Gibbs.

NORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core,
glares sternly at Gibbs. Standing besides him is GOVERNOR
WEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brass
buttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth's
father.

                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
           That will do.

                    GIBBS
          She was singing about pirates.
          Bad luck to sing about pirates,
          with us mired in this unnatural
          fog-- mark my words.

                    NORRINGTON
          Consider them marked.   On your
          way.

                    GIBBS
          'Aye, Captain.
              (as he moves off)
          Bad luck to have a woman on board,
          too. Even a mini'ture one.

He returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiously
takes a quick swig from flask.

                    ELIZABETH
          I think it would be rather
          exciting to meet a pirate.

                    NORRINGTON
          Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and
          dissolute creatures, the  lot of
          them. I intend to see to   it that
          any man who sails under a  pirate
          flag, or wears a pirates  brand,
          gets what he deserves: a  short
          drop and a sudden stop.

Elizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden
stop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung.

                    SWAN
          Captain Norrington... I appreciate
          your fervor, but I am concerned about
          the effect this subject will have on
          my daughter.

                    NORRINGTON
          My apologies, Governor.

                    ELIZABETH
          Actually, I find it all fascinating.

                    SWAN

          And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth,
          dear... we will be landing in Port
          Royal very soon, and beginning our new
          lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we
          comport ourselves as befits our class
          and station?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, father.

Chastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (to herself)
          I still think it would be exciting
          to meet a pirate...

The fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is
visible --

-- but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy,
WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty
water. There is nothing to show where he came from, or how
he came to be there.

                     ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Look!   A boy! In the water!

Norrington and Swann spot him --

                    NORRINGTON
          Man overboard!

                    ELIZABETH
          Boy overboard!

                    NORRINGTON
          Fetch a hook! Haul him out of
          there!

Quick movement and activity on the deck. Sailors use a
boathook to snag the boy he the passes. Norrington and
Swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabeth
sidles in for a closer look.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          He's still breathing.

                     SWAN

          Where did he come from?

                    GIBBS
          Mary mother of God ...

Attention is turned away from the boy --

The sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters
the water... along with the bodies of its crew. What is
left of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag
hanging limply from the stern.

The H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all.   The
scene calls for hushed voices.

                    SWAN
          What happened here?

                    NORRINGTON
          An explosion in the powder magazine.
          Merchant vessels run heavily armed.

                    GIBBS
          Lot of good it did them...
              (off Swan's look)
          Everyone's thinking it! I'm just
          saying it! Pirates!

                    SWAN
          There is no proof of that. It could
          have been an accident. Captain, these
          men were protection. If there is even
          the slightest chance one of those poor
          devils is still alive, we cannot
          abandon them!

                     NORRINGTON
          Of course not, Governor.
              (to the crew)
          Come about and strike the sails! Unlash
          the boats! Gunnery crew... jackets off
          the cannons!
              (to Swann)
          Hope for the best...prepare for
          the worst.
              (to two sailors)
          Move the boy aft. We'll need the
          deck clear.

They lift the boy. Swann pulls Elizabeth away from the
rail, away from the hideous scene in the water.

                    SWAN
          Elizabeth, I want you to accompany
          the boy. He's in your charge now.
          You'll watch over him?

Elizabeth nods gravely. Swann hurries away to help unstow
the longboat. The sailors lay the boy gently on the poop
deck, behind the wheel, then hurry off. Elizabeth kneels
down besides the boy.

His good looks are not lost on her. She reaches out,
gently brushes the blond hair from his eyes --

Suddenly, he grabs her wrist, awake now. Elizabeth is
startled, but their eyes lock. She takes his hand in hers.

                    ELIZABETH
          My name is Elizabeth Swann.

                    WILL
          Will Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          I'm watching over you, Will.

He clutches her hands, then slips back into
unconsciousness.

His movement has opened the collar of his shirt; Elizabeth
sees he wears a chain around his neck. She tugs it free,
revealing--

A GOLD MEDALLION.   One side is blank.   She turns it over --

A SKULL gazes up at her. Vaguely Aztec in design, but to
her eyes, it means one thing only:

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          You're a pirate.

She glances back at the crew.   Sees Norrington, giving
orders, moving toward her.

She looks back at Will -- comes to a quick decision. Takes
the medallion from around his neck. Hides it under her
coat.

Norrington arrives.

                    NORRINGTON
          Did he speak?

                    ELIZABETH
          His name is Will Turner -- that's
          all I found out.

                       NORRINGTON
          Very good.

Norrington hurries off. Elizabeth steals away to the stern
of the ship. Examines her prize -- the gold medallion. A
wisp of wind, and she looks up --

Out over the sea, moving through the fog, silent as a
ghost, is a large sailing ship, a schooner --

It has BLACK SAILS.

Elizabeth stares, too frightened to move, or cry out.

The ship is obscured by the fog it as it passes -- but not
the mizzen-top ... and there hangs the frightening skull
and crossbones of the Jolly Roger.

Elizabeth looks from it to the medallion -- the skull on
the flag is the same as the one on the medallion.

Fog surrounds and closes in on the black ship -- except for
the black flag. As Elizabeth watches, the skull appears to
TURN and GRIN at her --

Elizabeth shuts her eyes tight --

                       EIGHT YEARS LATER

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM

-- and then snap open again, startled wide with fear.

But this is no longer twelve-year-old Elizabeth standing on
the stern of the Dauntless; this is twenty-year-old
Elizabeth, lying in bed in the dark.

She remains motionless (were the images we just saw a
nightmare, or a jumbled childhood memory?)

Elizabeth slowly looks as far out the corner of her eyes as
possible without moving. Might there be someone in the
room with her, looming over her?

She turns, ready for anything.   She is alone.

Elizabeth sits up, turns up the flame on an oil lamp
besides the canopied bed. She carries the lamp across the
room to a dressing table, sits down.

She pulls one of the small drawers all the way out, reaches
into a space beneath it and removes --

The MEDALLION. She has kept it all this time. It has not
lost its luster -- or its sense of menace. She gazes at it
as she absently returns the draw to its place --

A BOOMING knock on the door;    Elizabeth jumps up, startled
knocking over her chair.

                    SWANN (O.S.)
          Elizabeth? Is everything all
          right? Are you decent?

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes -- yes.

She puts the medallion on, throws on a dressing gown as
Swann enters, carrying a large box. A uniformed maid,
ESTRELLA, follows.

                    SWANN
          Still abed at this hour?    It's a
          beautiful day!

Estrella pulls back the heavy curtains, revealing:

Beneath a blue sky lies the bucolic town of PORT ROYAL,
built on a natural harbor. On a bluff at the mouth of the
harbor stands FORT CHARLES, its stone parapets lined with
cannon.

                    SWANN (CONT'D)
          I have a gift for you.

He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet
dress. She lets out an admiring gasp.

                    ELIZABETH

          It's -- beautiful. May I inquire
          as to the occasion?

                    SWANN
          Is an occasion necessary for a father
          to dote upon his daughter with gifts?

Elizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened-
off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box.

                    SWANN (CONT'D)
          Although...I did think you could
          wear it to the ceremony today.

                       ELIZABETH (O.S.)
          Ceremony?

                    SWANN
          Captain Norrington's promotion
          ceremony.

Elizabeth peeks around the screen.

                       ELIZABETH
          I knew it.

                    SWANN
          Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a
          fine gentleman, don't you think?
              (no answer)
          He fancies you, you know.

Behind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS.

                       SWANN (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth?     How's it coming?

ON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and      the medallion (still
around her neck) out of the way as the      maid cinches her
into a corset over her slip. Estrella       has her foot in
Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces      tight.

                    ELIZABETH
          Difficult ... to say.

                    SWANN (O.S.)
          I'm told that dress is the very latest
          fashion in London.

                    ELIZABETH
              (holding her breath)
          Women in London must have learned to
          not breath.

Estrella is finished.   Elizabeth takes a breath -- and
winces.

A butler appears in the doorway of the room.

                    BUTLER
          Governor? A caller is here for
          you.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAY

The caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer,
looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long
presentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on
the back of his calves, but it doesn't help.

                     SWANN
          Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see
          you again!

The caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a
watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years.

                    WILL
          Good day, sir.
              (holds out the case)
          I have your order.

Swann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a
beautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out
reverently.

                    WILL (CONT'D)

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          The blade is folded steel. That's
          gold filigree laid into the
          handle. If I may -

He takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one
finger at the point where the blade meets the guard.

                    WILL (CONT'D)

          Perfectly balanced. The tang is nearly
          the full width of the blade..

                    SWANN
          Impressive. .. very impressive.
          Commodore Norrington will be pleased,
          I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to
          your master.

Will's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is
proud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword
around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case.

                    WILL
              (bows slightly)
          I shall. A craftsman is always pleased
          to hear his work is appreciated --

He stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann -

Elizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be
painful to wear, but holy smokes!

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth! You look stunning!

Will tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to
himself, and simply nods emphatically.

                    ELIZABETH
          Will! It's so good to see you!

Her hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion
is hidden in the bodice of her dress).

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I dreamt about you last night.
          Will reacts with surprise:
          "Really?

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth, this is hardly
          appropriate -

                    ELIZABETH
              (ignores her father)
          About the day we met. Do you
          remember?

                    WILL
          I could never forget it, Miss
          Swann.

                    ELIZABETH
          Will, how many times must I ask
          you to call me 'Elizabeth'?

                    WILL
          At least once more, Miss Swann. As
          always.

Elizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his
response.

                    SWANN
          Well said! There's a boy who
          understands propriety. Now, we must be
          going.

Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for
Elizabeth.

Elizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and
strides past Will.

                    ELIZABETH
          Good day, Mr. Turner.

EXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY

Swann follows Elizabeth out the door.

                      WILL
          Good day.

He watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the
driver.

                     WILL (CONT'D)
              (to himself)
          Elizabeth.

IN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter.

                    SWANN
          Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit
          more decorum in front of Commodore
          Norrington. After all, it is only

          through his efforts that Port Royal has
          become at all civilized.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY

The skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in
buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky
promontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a
sign:

PIRATES - YE BE WARNED.

The top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of
them. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in
the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling
rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW.

He gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a
tankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his
attention. He jumps from the rigging -

-- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an
imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a
single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon.

And it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail.

Jack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to
control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the
promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him.

The huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates
the bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the
H.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and
a mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at
the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort
Charles.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY

Smoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the
sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. The
HARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there
to catch a line and help Jack tie up.

                    HARBORMASTER
          If you're out rolling scuppers in
          this tub, you're either incredibly
          brave or incredibly stupid.

                    JACK
          It's remarkable how often those
          two traits coincide.

He starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides
the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small
powder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off.

                    HARBORMASTER
          It's a shilling for the dock
          space, and you're going to have to
          give me your name.

                    JACK
          What do you say to three
          shillings, and we forget the name?

He tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster
considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside.

                    HARBORMASTER
          Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith.

Jack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks across
the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above the
Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony
is underway -

EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY

With choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and
scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed
Navy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it
out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform.

Norrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and
Swann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the
sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann
steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps
back.

Norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow
officers, turns again and nods to the audience -
dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families.
Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard.

The silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from
the Navy men.

In the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out
beneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces.
Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material
of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her
discomfort.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAY

Two sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, take
advantage of what little shade there is on the dock. But
when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert.

                     MURTOGG
          This dock is off-limits to
          civilians.

                    JACK
          Sorry, I didn't know.

Music drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shields
his eyes.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh?
          You two weren't invited?

                     MURTOGG
          No ... someone has to make sure
          this dock stays off-limits to
          civilians.

                    JACK
          This must be some important boat.

                       MULLROY
          Ship.

                       JACK
          Ship.

                    MURTOGG
          Captain Norrington's made it his
          flagship. He'll use it to hunt
          down the last dregs of piracy on
          the Spanish Lake.

                       MULLROY
          Commodore.

                    MURTOGG
          Right. Commodore Norrington.

                    JACK
          That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it
          seems to me a ship like that --
              (indicates the Dauntless)
          -- makes this one here just a wee
          superfluous.

                    MURTOGG
          Oh, the Dauntless is the power in
          these waters, true enough -- but
          there's no ship that can match the
          Interceptor for speed.

                    JACK
          That so? I've heard of one, supposed to
          be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black
          Pearl?

Mullroy scoffs at the name.

                    MULLR0Y
          There's no real ship as can match
          the Interceptor.

                    MURTOGG
          The Black Pearl is a real ship.

                    MULLROY
          No, it's not.

                    MURTOGG
          Yes it is. I've seen it.

                    MULLR0Y
          You've seen it?

                    MURTOGG
          Yes.

                    MULLROY
          You've seen the Black Pearl?

                    MURTOGG
          Yes.

                    MULLR0Y

          You haven't seen it.

                    MURTOGG
          Yes, I have.

                    MULLR0Y
          You've seen a ship with black sails
          that's crewed by the damned and
          captained by a man so evil that hell
          itself spat him back out?

                     MURTOGG
          ... No .

                     MULLROY
          No.

                    MURTOGG
          But I've seen a ship with black sails.

                    MULLR0Y
          Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by
          the damned and captained by a man so
          evil hell itself spat him back out
          could possibly have black sails and
          therefore couldn't possibly be any ship
          other than the Black Pearl. Is that
          what you're saying?

                     MURTOGG
          ... no.

                    MULLR0Y
              (turns back to Jack)
          Like I said, there's no real ship
          as can match -- Hey!

But Jack's not there. Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot
-

Jack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually
examining the mechanism.

                     MULLROY (CONT'D)
          You!

Jack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. The
sailors hurry toward the gangplank.

                    MULLROY (CONT'D)
          Get away from there! You don't
          have permission to be aboard
          there!

Jack spreads his hands in apology.

                    JACK
          I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty
          boat. Ship.

The sailors study him suspiciously.

                    MURTOGG
          What's your name?

                       JACK
          Smith.

                    MULLR0Y
          What's your business in Port
          Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ?

                    MURTOGG
          And no lies!

                    JACK
          None? Very well. You've rumbled
          me. I confess: I intend to
          commandeer one of these ships,
          pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go
          out on the account, do a little
          honest pirating.

                    MURTOGG
          I said, no lies.

                    MULLR0Y
          I think he's telling the truth.

                    MURTOGG
          He's not telling the truth.

                       MULLROY
          He may be.

                    MURTOGG
          If he were telling the truth he
          wouldn't have told us.

                    JACK
          Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't
          believe the truth if he told it to you.

Murtogg and Mullroy consider that point --

EXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY

Elizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly,
oblivious to the music and chatter.

                    NORRINGTON
          May I have a moment?

He extends his arm. She takes it. He walks her away from
the party, toward the parapet. A rather too long of a
silence as Norrington works up his courage.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
              (a burst)
          You look lovely. Elizabeth.

Elizabeth frowns, unable to focus. Norrington mistakes her
expression as disapproval.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I apologize if I seem forward --
          but I must speak my mind.


                     NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
              (working up his
               confidence to do so)
          This promotion confirms that I have
          accomplished the goals I set for myself
          in my career. But it also casts into
          sharp relief that which I have not
          achieved. The thing all men most
          require: a marriage to a fine woman.
              (beat)
          You have become a fine woman,
          Elizabeth.

                    ELIZABETH
          I can't breathe.

                    NORRINGTON
              (smiles)

          I'm a bit nervous, myself --

Elizabeth loses her balance, stumbles away from Norrington.
She reaches a hand out to the parapet to steady herself,
but it slides off -

-- and then she vanishes over the wall. Gone.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth! .

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack reacts, pushes Murtogg aside to see -

Elizabeth plummets from the top of the cliff. It seems to
take her a long time to reach the sea --

Elizabeth hits the water, narrowly missing the sharp rocks.
A wave breaks, and then she is washed out away from the
cliff, struggling feebly.

AT THE FORT, Norrington looks down --

NORRINGTON ELIZABETH!

He leaps to the top of the parapet, prepared to dive -- a
lieutenant, GILLETTE catches his arm.

                    GILLETTE
          The rocks, sir! It's a miracle she
          missed them!

Norrington shakes off his arm, looks down -- and realizes
Gillette is right. He jumps down and runs --

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCKS - DAY

Jack, Murtogg and Mullroy are still in shock from the
sight.

                    JACK
          Aren't you going to save her?

                    MULLR0Y
          I can't swim.

Murtogg shakes his head -- neither does he.

                    JACK
              (rolls his eyes)
          Sailors.

Above where Elizabeth struggles in the water. Norrington
and several other men pick their way down the cliffs. They
are too far away to get to her in time.

Jack scowls. He has no choice -- and it pisses him off.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Fine.

He pulls a pistol from his sword belt, hands it to Murtogg;
then hands the belt to Mullroy.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Don't lose these.

And then he dives into the water, swims toward Elizabeth.

Elizabeth struggles to keep above water, gasping for air '-
then a swell rolls over her, and she is submerged -

UNDERWATER, Elizabeth drifts down, unconscious. The current
turns her, and the MEDALLION slips loose from her bodice.

The MEDALLION turns slowly, until the SKULL is fully
visible. A shaft of filtered sunlight hits it, and it
GLINTS -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - VARIOUS - DAY

FORT CHARLES: The British flag flies, blown from an
offshore breeze. Suddenly the wind dies, and the flag goes
limp.

ON THE DOCKS: Wood and metal fittings on lines bang against
masts. The wind dies, and there is silence.

ON THE EDGE OF TOWN: A CARIBE WOMAN feeds clucking
chickens, frowns when they all suddenly go quiet ...

IN THE VILLAGE: A weather vane moves slightly in the wind.
The wind stops, and all is still. And then ...

... the weather vane TURNS, and holds steady -- the wind
has picked up again, but now blows .from the sea toward the
land.

l)ON THE BEACH: an OLD SALT pulls a rope line, pauses.
Turns and gazes to the sky, frowning. The mangy hound at
his side starts BARKING incessantly -

ON THE DOCKS: The lines bang against the other sides of the
masts, the wind far stronger now.

FORT CHARLES: the British flag flies in the opposite
direction, snapping in the new onshore breeze.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - CLIFFSIDE - DAY

Norrington rushes down, intent on the climb. Beyond him,
past the rocky point, far out to sea, FOG gathers -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAY

UNDERWATER: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmoving
form - - and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around her
and makes for the surface.

ON THE SURFACE, Jack swims toward the dock, struggling. It
is .: far more difficult than it should be. He stops
stroking, and they submerge.

UNDERWATER: Jack realizes that   it is Elizabeth's heavy
velvet dress that is weighing   them down. He pulls at the
buttons on the back, and they   give way. He skins her out of
the dress, and kicks away from   it.

The dress falls like a cloud into darkness -

ON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more
quickly.

AT THE DOCK, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul
Elizabeth out of the water.

Jack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth is on her back;
Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them.
Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth.

                    MULLROY
          Not breathing.

Murtogg looks down; it seems hopeless. Jack steps up,
drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath.

                    JACK

          Move.

He pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the
knife -- Murtogg is shocked -

Jack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away.

Elizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up water
and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is
relieved.

                    MULLROY
          I never would have thought of
          that.

                     JACK
          Clearly, you've never been to
          Singapore.

Jack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg -
and that's when he spots -

The MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his "hand.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Where did you get this?

Before Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at
Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in
fact, looking bright and sharp.

                    NORRINGTON
          On your feet.

It looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her
clothes gone. He gets to his feet. The rest of Elizabeth's
erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann.

                    SWANN
          Elizabeth! Are you all right?

He strips off his jacket, drapes it around her.

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore
          Norrington, do you intend to kill
          my rescuer?

Norrington looks at Jack. Jack nods as best he can with a
blade beneath his chin. Norrington sheathes his sword, and
extends his hand.

                    NORRINGTON
          I believe thanks are in order.

Jack takes Norrington's hand gingerly. They shake -

-- and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm
toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt -

-- exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.'

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Had a brush-up with the East India
          Trading Company, did you ... pirate?

The others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained
--in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack. He
stands there, still holding the corset.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette,
          fetch some irons.

Norrington notices something else -- below the 'P' brand is
a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?

                    JACK
          Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please.

Norrington looks out at the bay.

                    NORRINGTON
          I don't see your ship -- Captain.

                    MURTOGG
          He said he'd come to commandeer one.

                    MULLROY
              (to Murtogg)
          I told you he was telling the truth.
              (currying favor)
          These are his, sir.

He holds out Jack's pistol and belt. Norrington takes the
pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt.

                    NORRINGTON
              (to Jack)
          Extra powder, but no additional shot.

Jack shrugs. Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt,
opens it. He frowns at the reading. Moves the compass this
way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          It doesn't bear true.

Jack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns the
compass to the belt. Draws the sword half from the
scabbard.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I half-expected it to be made of wood.

He slides it back into the scabbard, hands it to Mullroy.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Taking stock: you've got a pistol with
          only one shot, a compass that doesn't
          point north ... and no ship. You are
          without a doubt the worst pirate I have
          ever heard of.

                    JACK
          Ah, but you have heard of me.

Gillette returns with shackles, approaches Jack.

                    NORRINGTON
          Carefully, lieutenant.

Elizabeth steps forward. Swann's jacket slips off her. She
is unconcerned, but he is intent on putting it back on her.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, I must protest. Pirate or
          not, this man saved my life.

                    NORRINGTON
          One good deed is not enough to redeem a
          man of a lifetime of wickedness.

Gillette snaps the manacles closed on Jack's wrists.

                    JACK
          But it seems to be enough to condemn
          him.

                    NORRINGTON
              (smiles)
          Indeed.

Now that Jack is safely chained, Norrington nods to his
men. All but one stow their weapons, and two step forward -

                       JACK
          Finally.

Lightning-quick, he snaps the   corset  around the hand and
wrist of the man holding the   pistol  and yanks. The pistol
sails into the water. Before   anyone  can react to that, Jack
has the manacle chain wrapped   around  Elizabeth's throat.

Pistols are drawn again, but now Elizabeth serves as a
shield. Norrington raises a cautioning hand to his men.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (backing away, toward land)
          Commodore Norrington ... my pistol and
          belt, please.

Norrington hesitates, balls his fists in frustration.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Commodore!

Mullroy hands the pistol and belt to Norrington. Norrington
holds them out to Jack.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Elizabeth -- it is Elizabeth?

Elizabeth is more angry than frightened.

ELIZABETH Miss Swann.

                    JACK
          Miss Swann, if you'll be so kind?

She takes the belt and pistol from Norrington -- Jack's
quicker than she is, and takes the pistol from her. He
jerks her around so she is facing him, belly to belly.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Now, if you'll be very kind?

She figures out what he wants: put the belt on him.

                    ELIZABETH
              (as she works)
          You are despicable.

                    JACK
          I saved your life; now you've
          saved mine. We're square.

Done. He turns her again, and then backs up until he bumps
against the cargo gantry.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Gentleman. .. m' lady. .. you will
          always remember this as the day
          you almost caught Captain Jack
          Sparrow.

He shoves Elizabeth away, grabs a rope and pulls free a
belaying pin -- a counterweight drops and Jack is lifted up
to the middle of the gantry, where he grabs a second rope -

Pistols fire -- and miss. Jack swings out, out, out, away
and around from the gantry.

Norrington has held his shot. With careful aim, he tracks
Jack's trajectory-

Jack drops from the rope even as Norrington FIRES. His shot
tears the rope -

-- as Jack plummets past one of the gantry's guy lines, he
snaps the length of manacle chain over the line and grabs
hold of the far loop -- slides down the line -

-- drops to the deck of a ship. He runs, leaping to another
ship, then out of sight -

                    NORRINGTON
          On his heels! Gillette, bring a
          squad down from the fort!

              (to Elizabeth)
          Elizabeth, are you -

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, I'm all right, I'm fine! Go
          capture him.

Norrington's taken aback by her ire, and wisely hurries
away. Swann drapes his coat around Elizabeth.

                    SWANN
          Here, dear ... you should wear this.

Elizabeth shivers, finding suddenly that she is cold.
Glances out at the bay -

-- where a THICK FOG moves across the top of the water. She
takes the jacket.

                    ELIZABETH
          Thank you, Father ... and let that
          be the last of your fashion
          advice, please.

But she accepts his comforting embrace.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - ALLEY - DAY

The fog creeps through, casting an eerie twilight pall. An
armed search party moves along the street. They glance down
an alley-

On the far side is another search party. The men nod to
each other, continue on.

A moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath
the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles.

Across the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru
door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY

Jack slips in through the door, takes a look around:

No windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in-
progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron
gates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But every
tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat.

Jack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a
blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a
bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts,
turns away.

Satisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled
sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing
coke furnace in the middle of the room.

Slowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the
chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack
sweats, grimaces at the pain -

Moving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an
anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on
the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge,
plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam
billows.

Jack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath
the manacle -- but his hands are free.

The SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover.

Will enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the
drunken Mister Brown in the corner.

                    WILL
          Right where I left you.

Something catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The
sledge lying beside the anvil.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
              (under his breath)
          Not where I left you.

He moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it --
but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps
back.

Jack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up,
toward the door. Will glares at him.

                    WILL (CONT' D)
              (voice low and tight)
          You're the one they're hunting.
          The pirate.

Jack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then
frowns, regards Will.

                    JACK
          You look familiar ... Have I ever
          threatened you before?

                    WILL
          I've made a point of avoiding
          familiarity with pirates.

                    JACK
          Ah. Then it would be a shame to
          put a black mark on your record.
          So if you'll excuse me ...

Beside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in
the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it
in hand.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Do you think this is wise, boy?
          Crossing blades with a pirate?

                    WILL
          You threatened Miss Swann.

                    JACK
          Only a little.

In response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack
appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing.

Jack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading
feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost
impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          You know what you're doing, I'll
          give you that ... Excellent form
          ... But how's your footwork? If I
          step here -

He takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the
other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Very good! And if I step again,
          you step again. . .

              (continuing to step
               around the circle)
          And so we circle, circle, like
          dogs we circle. . .

They are now exactly opposite their initial positions.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Ta!

Jack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him.

Will registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious
overhand motion, he throws his sword -

-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the
latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls
on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the
way.

Jack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it
is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he
turns back to Will, he's smiling.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          That's a good trick. Except, once
          again, you are between me and the
          way out.
              (points his sword at the
               back door)
          And now you have no weapon.

Eyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an
anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward.

Will and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly,
Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at
Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed.

Then Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming
him.

Will quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware
that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords,
knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Who makes all these?

                    WILL
          I do. And I practice with them. At
          least three hours a day.

                    JACK
          You need to find yourself a girl.
              (Will sets his jaw)
          Or maybe the reason you practice
          three hours a day is you've found
          one -- but can't get her?

A direct hit -- and Will coils even more tightly with
anger.

                    WILL
          No. I practice three hours a day
          so that when I meet a pirate ... I
          can kill him.

He explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his
hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the
air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing.

Jack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps
around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard
through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling -

So Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the
ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and
dodging around the furnace -

Jack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS
into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up,
kicks with his feet, knocking Will back.

Jack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the
ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second,
hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls
down, gets up -

Jack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes.

Will steps back, directly in front of the back exit.
Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          You cheated.

                    JACK

              (smiles; what do you expect?)
          Pirate.

Jack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the
door.

                       JACK (CONT'D)
          Move away.

                       WILL
          No.

                       JACK
          Move!

                    WILL
          No. I can not just step aside and
          let you escape.

Jack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off
lasts for a long moment.

                    JACK
          You're lucky, boy -- this shot's
          not meant for you.

Jack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack
-

Suddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's
skull. Jack crumples to the ground.

The front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the
room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground.

                    NORRINGTON
          Excellent work, Mister Brown.
          You've aided in the capture of a
          dangerous fugitive.

                    BROWN
          Just doing my civic duty.

Jack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles.

                    NORRINGTON
          I believe you will always remember
          this as the day Captain Jack
          Sparrow almost escaped.

Norrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go.
Brown looks at his bottle -- broken.

                    BROWN
          That ratter broke my bottle.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

The thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town.

The only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the

bluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey.

Above the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A
waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow.

ANGLE - FORT CHARLES,

just below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly
deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the
water: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying
from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull.

The Black Pearl has come to Port Royal.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

A maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it
between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed.

                     ELIZABETH
          Nice and toasty. Thank you,
          Estrellia.

The maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins
reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around
her neck.

The lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn
it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Will, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron
ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops.

His attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter
and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing,

he reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it
down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands.

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his
mouth.

Three seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their
cell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a
bone. The dog just sits and cocks its head.

                    PRISONER
          Come here, boy... Want a nice,
          juicy bone?

In an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw.

                    JACK
          You can keep doing that forever,
          that dog's never going to move.

                    PRISONER
          Excuse us if we ain't resigned
          ourselves to the gallows just yet.

EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

A noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard. Norrington
and Swann walk along the far wall.

                    SWANN
          Has my daughter given you an
          answer yet?

                    NORRINGTON
          No. She hasn't.

                    SWANN
          Well, she had a taxing day...
          Ghastly weather tonight.

                    NORRINGTON
          Bleak. Very bleak.

From the distance, there is a BOOM -

                    SWANN
          What was that?

-- and then the WHISTLE of an incoming ball --

                    NORRINGTON
          Cannon fire!

He tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet EXPLODES --

INT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

Jack sits up. There are more BOOMS -

                    JACK
          I know those guns!

He peers out through the bars of the window. The other
prisoners crowd around their window as well.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          It's the Black Pearl.

                     PRISONER
              (frightened)
          The Black Pearl? I've heard
          stories ... she's been preying on
          ships and settlements for near ten
          years ... and never leaves any
          survivors.

                    JACK
          There are a lot of stories about
          the Black Pearl.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - NIGHT

The Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights
up around her with each boom of her guns. She's firing on
both sides now, hammering both the fort and the town.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - NIGHT

Streets, buildings, docks and ships shatter and explode
beneath the onslaught. Villagers panic, run for cover,
dodge flying debris as best they can. If this is not hell
on earth, then it's about to be --

-- long boats emerge out of the fog, carrying ARMED
PIRATES. They swarm from the boats, striking down
,villagers indiscriminately and setting fires.

INT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT

Will slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of
his back. He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a
third. He picks up a second axe and a sword.

Will slides back the doors of the forge --

A woman runs past, chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a
yellow bandeau. Will backhands the axe square into his
chest, a deadly blow. Will heads out, up the street --

EXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT

The moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning
gallows and wooden roofs. Cannon fire continues to rain
down, but the fort's own cannons now return fire.

                    NORRINGTON
          Governor! Barricade yourself in my
          office!
              (Swann hesitates)
          That's an order!

Swann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a
pirate -- KOEHLER, a handsome blond man with gold earrings.
Beyond Koehler, more pirates come up over the far wall.
Koehler grins and raises a cutlass -

-- Norrington's sword blocks Koehler's slash.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          They've flanked us! Men! Swords
          and pistols!

The battle is joined --

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH f S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even
through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn
in the harbor. Shouts and cries of pain. Cannon fire
ECHOES.

She notices movement directly below her window: two SHADOWY
FIGURES, approaching the house -- pirates. Elizabeth bolts
from her room--

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

She reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries
out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there
is the BOOM of a gun, and the butler crumples.

Elizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the
balusters. The pirates scan the foyer, searching. The
leader is PINTEL, a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head.

Suddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth.
How could he know she was there?

                      PINTEL
          Up there!

The pirates rush for the stairs. Elizabeth scrambles back
into the nearest room--

INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth shuts the door, locks it, listens as the pirates
pound up the stairs --

                    ESTRELLA
          Miss Elizabeth?

Elizabeth jumps. Estrella is right behind her, terrified.
They whisper:

                    ESTRELLA (CONT'D)
          Are they come to kidnap you, miss?
          The daughter of the governor would
          be very valuable.

Elizabeth realizes she's right. There is the SLAM of a body
against the door.

                    ELIZABETH
          Listen, Estrella -- they haven't
          seen you. Hide, and first chance,
          run for the fort .

Estrella nods. Another SLAM at the door -- it gives a bit -
-

Elizabeth shoves Estrella into the corner, between a tall
wardrobe and the wall. Dashes for the side door.

When the door smashes inward, it slams into the wardrobe,
and the maid cannot be seen. The pirates run in -- spot the
open side door, and run for it --

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Pintel is the first through, and gets the pan of the bed
warmer in the face for his trouble -- he staggers back,
holding his nose --

INT. SITIING ROOM - NIGHT

Estrella breaks cover, runs for the hall, unnoticed.

INT. ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth swings the bed warmer at the second pirate,
but he catches it by the handle -- Elizabeth can't jerk it
free, so she wrenches it over -- the pan lid swings down,
BANGING the second pirate -- hot coals spill on his head,
sizzling.

Elizabeth dashes for the hallway stairs -

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY/FOYER - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

The pirates burst from the bedroom -- Pintel goes for the
stairs, but the second pirate vaults the handrail --

Estrella registers the butler's body, but continues out the
still-open front door at a dead run. Elizabeth follows --

The second pirate lands between Elizabeth and the front
door. His face is BURNED, his hair SMOLDERS -- he reaches -
-

Elizabeth pulls up short, runs the other way --

Pintel, on the stairs, grabs her by the hair -- Elizabeth

doesn't slow -- she spins, grabs Pintel's arm with both
hands and pulls him hard, belly-first, into the cap of the
newel post -- he lets go of her hair -- Elizabeth keeps
going

INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Elizabeth slams the double doors shut, throws the bolts.
The interior shutters are closed over the windows. Above
the fireplace are two crossed swords.

Elizabeth climbs on the firebox; she grabs one of the
swords by the hilt and pulls -- but it won't come free.
Both swords are securely attached to the wall. Damn!

A SMASH from the doors -- the pirates are relentless -

On the table is a platter with fruit, cheese and bread.
Elizabeth grabs the knife from the platter -

Like any bread knife, it has a round point. Elizabeth jabs
it into her palm -- it's useless as a weapon. Double damn!

The blade of a boarding axe breaches the door -- the
pirates will be through soon -- Elizabeth looks around -

INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

The doors give way; the pirates charge through -

INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

Empty. Elizabeth nowhere to be seen. Pintel and Smoldering
Pirate search, under the table, behind draperies.

                    PINTEL
          We know you're here, poppet. Come
          out and we promise we won't hurt
          you.

Smoldering pirate gives him look -- he wants to hurt her
plenty. Pintel shakes his head: 'Don't worry, I'm lying.'

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          We will find you, poppet ...
          You've got something of ours, and
          it calls to us!

INT. DUMBWAITER - NIGHT

Elizabeth hides in the dumbwaiter box, wrapped around the
double pulley ropes that go through the center.

                    PINTEL (O.S.)
          The gold calls to us!

Elizabeth registers that -- she pulls out the medallion,
rubs

the gold with her thumb. This is their objective. Light

spills into the- box through gaps in the top as the door
above is slid open -- Elizabeth looks up through the gaps -

Pintel leers down at her.

                      PINTEL (CONT'D)
            Hello, poppet.

Elizabeth works the ropes to lower  the box. Pintel pulls
the other way; he's stronger, and  the box rises. Elizabeth
tries to stop it -- wraps her left  forearm through the rope
and lets it jam against the top of  the box.

Elizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops. She saws at
the rope with the bread knife.

Smoldering pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's
forearm. Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing -

The rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS -

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

From behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH, and a
cloud of dust. The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers
out. Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can
barely stand. She leans over the table, trying to recover.

The sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ...

                      ELIZABETH
            Please, no ...

Elizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a
desperate idea occurs to her.

The pirates burst through the door. Elizabeth backs away,
holds the bread knife out to ward them off. They come
around either side of the table, stalking her -

                      ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
                (gasps it out)
            Par. .. Parlay!

Pintel can't believe his ears.

                    PINTEL
          What?

                    ELIZABETH
          Parlay! I invoke the right of
          parlay! According to" the Code of
          the Brethren, set down by the
          pirates Morgan and Bartholomew,
          you must take me to your Captain!

                    PINTEL
          I know the code.

                    ELIZABETH
          If an adversary demands parley,
          you can do them no harm until the
          parlay is complete.

                    PINTEL
          It would appear, so do you.

                    SMOLDERING PIRATE
          To blazes with the code!

He steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him.

                    PINTEL
          She wants to be taken to the
          Captain, and she'll go without a
          fuss.

He looks to Elizabeth: 'right?' Elizabeth nods.

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          We must honor the code.

Smoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. He
grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - NIGHT

Will races along, momentarily free of the pirates. He spots
the Governor's Mansion in the distance. There are FIGURES
moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two
pirates.

Will hurries forward -

Suddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will
defends himself. The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow
bandana. Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy?

The hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging
a flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind. Will
crumples.

The pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they
hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go.

On the ground, Will doesn't move.

INT. FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT

The wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself
out from under rubble. Moonlight spills in through the
gaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom.

But it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's
cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through.

                       PRISIONER
          Praise be!

He and the other two scramble through.

                    PRISONER (CONT'D)
              (back to Jack)
          My sympathies, friend - - you've
          no manner of luck at all!

The three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view.

Jack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits
shaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key
ring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks
up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog
forward.

                    JACK
          It's all right, doggie ... come
          here,

boy. Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido?

To his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench.
Jack continues to coax him closer.

The key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the
dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He
BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What's the matter, boy?

The dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out
through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him.

The door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates
step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG.

                    TWIGG
          This isn't the armory.

He turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack.

                    KOEHLER
              (Dutch accent)
          Well, well... Look what we have
          here, Twigg. It's. Captain
          Sparrow.

                    TWIGG
          Huh. Last time I saw you, you were
          all alone on a God-forsaken
          island, shrinking into the
          distance. I'd heard you'd gotten
          off, but I didn't believe it.

                    KOEHLER
          Did you sprout little wings and
          flyaway?

                    TWIGG
          His fortunes aren't improved much.

The two laugh. Jack doesn't. He steps forward, close to the
bars. This puts him in a spill of moonlight. He is tight
with fury.

                    JACK
          Worry about your own fortunes. The
          lowest circle of hell is reserved
          for betrayers ... and mutineers.

Koehler and Twigg don't like hearing that. Koehler lashes
out, grabs Jack by the throat through the bars. Jack
clutches the pirate's wrist, looks down -

Where they enter the moonlight, Koehler's wrists and hands
are skeletal.

Jack's eyes go wide -- he is holding a skeleton arm.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          You are cursed.

Koehler sneers, shoves Jack backwards, hard. Now out of the
moonlight, his hand is normal. Jack stares, realizing -

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          The stories are true.

Koehler ushers Twigg toward the door. Looks back.

                    KOEHLER
          You know nothing of hell.

And then they're gone.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT

Amid the thunder of cannon fire, a longboat slips through
the fog. Elizabeth sits in the prow. Columns of water from
cannon balls geyser up around the boat.

The fog parts. Elizabeth looks up to see --

The Black Pearl, a tall galleon, its black sails looming
high above her. At the bow is an ornately carved figurehead
of a beautiful woman, arm held high, a small bird taking
wing from her outstretched hand.

The longboat makes for a pair of lines dangling from a
winch.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog. Smoke
hangs heavy above the deck.

Elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail --
pirates spot her, and stare. One polite fellow steps

forward to offer his hand. She takes it and steps down. She
huddles, self-conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe.

                    BOSUN
          I didn't know we was taking
          captives.

                    PINTEL
          She's invoked the right of
          parlay... with Captain Barbossa.

ON THE POOP DECK -- an imposing FIGURE in silhouette stands
by the wheel, too far away to have heard Pintel's words.
But his head turns at the mention of his name.

The silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs. A cloud of
SMOKE obscures him -- and then, as if he skipped the
stairs, he strides out of the SMOKE on the main deck-

This is BARBOSSA. Despite the bright colors of clothing,
definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley --
or anywhere, for that matter.

Elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from
his eyes. But she musters her courage -

                    ELIZABETH
          I am here to --

The Bosun SLAPS her.

                    BOSUN
          You'll speak when spoken to!

His wrist is grabbed -- painfully -- by Barbossa.

                    BARBOSSA
          And you'll not lay a hand on those
          under the protection of parlay!

                       BOSUN
          Aye, sir.

Barbossa releases him. Turns to Elizabeth, smiles -- it
shows both silver and gold teeth.

                       BARBOSSA

          My apologies, miss. As you were
          saying, before you were so rudely
          interrupted?

                    ELIZABETH
          Captain Barbossa ... I have come
          to negotiate the cessation of
          hostilities against Port Royal.

Barbossa is both impressed and amused.

                    BARBOSSA
          There was a lot of long words in
          there, miss, and we're not but
          humble pirates. What is it you
          want?

                     ELIZABETH
          I want you to leave. And never
          come back.

Barbossa and the pirates laugh.

                    BARBOSSA
          I am disinclined to acquiesce to
          your request.
              (helpfully)
          Means' No. '

                       ELIZABETH
          Very well.

She quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side
rail, dangles it over the side of the ship. The pirates go
quiet.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          I'll drop it!

                    BARBOSSA
          My holds are bursting with swag.
          That bit of shine matters to me
          ... Why?

                    ELIZABETH
          Because it's what you're searching
          for. You've been searching for it
          for years. I recognize this ship.

          I saw it eight years ago, when we
          made the crossing from England.

                    BARBOSSA
              (interested)
          Did you, now?

Elizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere.

                    ELIZABETH
          Fine. I suppose if this is
          worthless, there's no reason to
          keep it.

She flips the medallion up, off her finger -

                    BARBOSSA
          NO!

She catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You have a name, missy?

                     ELIZABETH
          Elizabeth -
              (stops herself from
               saying "Swann"; then:)
          Turner.
              (embroidering)
          I'm a maid in the governor's
          household.
              (curtsies)
          Barbossa reacts to the name
          Turner: it confirms what he has
          suspected. The other pirates
          surreptitiously exchange glances
          and nods.

                    BARBOSSA
          You've got sand, for a maid.

                    ELIZABETH
              (curtsies again)
          Thank you, sir.

                    BARBOSSA

          And how does a maid come to own a
          trinket such as that? A family
          heirloom, perhaps?

                    ELIZABETH
          Of course.
              (offended)
          I didn't steal it, if that's what
          you mean.

                    BARBOSSA
          No, no, nothing like that.
              (comes to a decision)
          Very well. You hand that over,
          we'll put your town to our rudder
          and ne'er return.

                    ELIZABETH
          Can I trust you?

                    BARBOSSA
          It's you who invoked the parlay!
          Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand
          it over, now... or these be the
          last friendly words you'll hear!

Elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds out
the medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like
hope.

                    ELIZABETH
          Our bargain. . ?

Barbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun.

                    BOSUN
          Still the guns, and stow 'em!
          Signal the men, set the flags, and
          make good to clear port!

For the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of
the guns ceases. Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved.
The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away.

                    ELIZABETH
          Wait! You must return me to shore!
          According to the rules of the
          Order of the Brethren -

Barbossa wheels on her.

                     BARBOSSA
          First. Your return to shore was
          not part of our negotiations nor
          our agreement, and so I 'must' do
          nothing. Secondly: you must be a
          pirate for the pirate's code to
          apply. And you're not. And
          thirdly...

the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual
rules.

(grins gold and silver)

Welcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner.

Elizabeth stares in speechless terror -

EXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN

As the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back
along the deck to the captain's cabin.

The fog starts to dissipate, turning to a light mist;
through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of
dawn.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN

Will comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet.

He takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is
dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed
and still smolder. The aftermath of hell on earth.

Will turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion.

INT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - MORNING

Will races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls
out:

                    WILL
          Miss Swann! Elizabeth!

A terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned
chair, fallen bookshelf -

INT. FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTON'S OFFICE - MORNING

Will bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe.

                     WILL
          They've taken her! They've taken
          Elizabeth!

A group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette
among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it
drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a
chair.

                    NORRINGTON
          We're aware of the situation.

                    WILL
          We have to hunt them down -- and
          save her!

Swann's worry has made him short-tempered.

                    SWANN
          Where do you propose we start? If
          you have any information that
          concerns my daughter, then share
          it! If anyone does, tell me!
              (Will is silent)
          Leave, Mr. Turner.

Murtogg has remembered something. He ventures it warily:

                    MURTOGG
          That Jack Sparrow... he talked
          about the Black Pearl.

                    MULLROY
          Mentioned it, is more what he did.

                     MURTOGG
          Still --

                    WILL
          We can ask him where it is --
          maybe he can lead us to it!

                     SWANN

          That pirate tried to kill my
          daughter. We could never trust a
          word he said!

                    WILL
          We could strike a bargain -

                    NORRINGTON
          No. The pirates who invaded   this
          fort left Sparrow locked in   his
          cell. Ergo, he is not their   ally,
          and therefore of no value.
              (through with Will)
          We will determine their most
          likely course, and launch a   search
          mission that sails with the   tide.

Will slams the boarding axe into the desk, through the map.

                    WILL
          That's not good enough. This is
          Elizabeth's life!

Norrington is quick to react; he throws a strong arm across
Will's back, and guides him roughly to the door.

                    NORRINGTON
          Mr. Turner, this is not the time
          for rash actions.
              (low)
          Do not make the mistake of
          thinking you are the only man here
          who loves Elizabeth.
              (firm)
          Now, go home.

He opens the door, and then turns away. Will watches him
walk back to the desk. Will's face sets in resolve, and he
leaves.

INT. FORT CHARLES - JAIL CELLS - MORNING

Jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. Even with
the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. He hears
the sound of the door latch -

The door opens, and Will slips in. Looks around. Jack
lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and
unconcerned. Will marches straight up to the bars.

                    WILL
          Are you familiar with that ship?
          The Black Pearl?

                      JACK
          Somewhat.

                    WILL
          Where does it make berth?

                    JACK
          Surely you've heard the stories? The
          Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla
          de Mureta... an island that cannot be
          found -- except by those who already
          know where it is.

                    WILL
          The ship's real enough. So its
          anchorage must be a real place. Where
          is it?

                    JACK
          Why ask me?

                    WILL
          Because you're a pirate.

                    JACK
          And you want to turn pirate
          yourself?

                    WILL
          Never.
              (beat)
          They took Miss Swann.

                    JACK
              (he was right)
          So it is that you found a girl. Well,
          if you're intending to brave all and
          hasten to her rescue and so win fair
          lady's heart, you'll have to do it
          alone. I see no profit in it for me.

Will slams his fist against the bars in frustration. Jack
is surprised at the outburst. Will thinks ... makes a
decision.

                    WILL
          I can get you out of here.

                    JACK
          How? The key's run off.

                    WILL
              (examines the cell)
          I helped build these cells. Those are
          hook-and-ring hinges. The proper
          application of strength, the door'll
          lift free. Just calls for the right
          lever and fulcrum. . .

Jack watches Will as he speaks, and it dawns on him -- Will
is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.

                    JACK
          Your name is Turner.

Will gives him a puzzled look.

                    WILL
          Yes. Will Turner.

Jack grins.

                    JACK
          Will Turner...
              (he stands)
          I'll tell you what, Mr. Turner. I've
          changed my mind. You spring me from
          this cell, and on pain of death, I'll
          you to the Black Pearl.
              (sticks out his hand)
          Do we have an accord?

Will gives him a suspicious look. The deal seems too good.
Jack keeps his hand out, still smiling. Will shakes it.

                    WILL
          Agreed.

                    JACK
          Agreed!

Will looks around, figures out   what he needs. He makes a
chair his fulcrum, and levers   the long bench under the
door. Pushes down -- it's hard   work -- but the cell door
rises, and then falls forward,   CRASHING down on the bench
and chair.

Jack is impressed. He steps out of the cell.

                    WILL
          Someone will have heard that.
          Hurry.

Will heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards.

                    JACK
          Not without my effects.

                    WILL
          We need to go!

Jack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on
the belt, checks the shot in his pistol.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          Why are you bothering with that?

                     JACK
          My business, Will. As for your business
          -one question, or there's no use going.
               (joins Will at the door)
          This girl -- what does she mean to you?
          How far are you willing to go to save
          her?

                    WILL
              (no hesitation)
          I'd die for her.

                    JACK
          Good.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING

The Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats
low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its
lines.

                    JACK (O.S.)
          Ah, now there's a lovely sight!

Jack hops down into the boat. Prepares to make way.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report
          her. Honest men are slaves to their
          conscience, and there's no predicting
          'em. But you can always trust a
          dishonest man to stay that way...

Jack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock,
staring at the boat in dismay.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Come aboard.

                    WILL
          I haven't set foot off dry land I was
          twelve, when the ship I was on
          exploded.
              (regards the boat)
          It's been a sound policy.

                    JACK
          No worries there. She's far more
          likely to rot out from under us.

Will steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to
capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Besides, we are about to better
          our prospects considerably.

He nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor.
Will whiteknuckles the gunwales.

                    WILL
          We're going to steal a ship? That
          ship?

                    JACK
          Commandeer. We're going to
          commandeer a ship. Nautical term.

                    WILL
          It's still against the law.

                    JACK

          So's breaking a man out of jail. Face
          it, Will: you may say you'll never be a
          pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring
          start.
              (smiling)
          My advice -- smile and enjoy it.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - MORNING

The Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against
the H.M.S. Dauntless. Will holds a stay line with iron
fists.

                     WILL
          This is either crazy, or
          brilliant.

                    JACK
          Remarkable how often those two
          traits coincide.

The Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship -

EXT. H. M. S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING

There's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy
sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing
dice. Murtogg and Mullroy among them.

Suddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open -

brandishing pistols.

                    JACK
          Everybody stay calm. We're taking
          over the ship!

                    WILL
              (a beat)
          Aye! Avast!

Jack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that.

The sailors all look   at them -- and then burst out
LAUGHING. They grin,   shake their heads. Jack stands there,
grinning with them --   but his gun is still level. The
Lieutenant, GILLETTE,   steps forward.

                       GILLETTE

          You're serious about this.

Jack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette.

                    JACK
          Dead serious.

                    GILLETTE
          You understand this ship cannot be
          crewed by only two men. You'll never
          make it out of the bay.

                    JACK
          We'll see about that.

More guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors move forward,
hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand.

                    GILLETTE
          Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed
          or wounded in this foolish enterprise.

                    JACK
          Fine by me. We brought you a nice
          little boat, so you can all get back to
          shore, safe and sound.

                    GILLETTE
              (a curt nod)
          Agreed. You have the momentary
          advantage, sir. But I will see you
          smile from the yard arm sir.

                    JACK
          As likely as not.
              (calling)
          Will, short up the anchor, we've
          got ourselves a ship!

EXT. DAUNTLESS - STERN - MORNING

Sailors make their way down a rope ladder, crowd onto the
Jolly Mon. Will pushes hard against the windlass, to no
avail ... the anchor is too heavy for one man. Jack
notices.

                    JACK
          A little help?

Gillette shrugs, gestures to Murtogg and Mullroy. The three
men throw their weight into the windlass, and it turns.
Jack's pistol is on them the whole time.

                    MURTOGG
          I can't believe he's doing this.

The windless turns, bringing Mullroy into view.

                    MULLROY
          You didn't believe he was telling the
          truth, either.

The windless turns some more, and there's Gillette.

                    GILLETTE
              (over his shoulder, to Will)
          Do you have any idea, boy, what you're
          doing?

Another quarter turn -

                      WILL
          No.

EXT. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY

Jack and Will crank a capstan, raising the forward jib
sail. It luffs and billows out. The huge ship inches
forward slowly, pulled by just the one sail. Jack grins.

                    JACK
          Lookee there, mate! We're
          underway!

EXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCK - DAY

Norrington moves along, concentrating on a manifest.
Alongside him is governor Swann, who glances over -

Sees the tiny Jolly Mon headed toward them, riding low in
the water, overloaded with sailors. Beyond that, the
Dauntless sails -- albeit slowly -- for open waters.

                    SWANN
          Commodore --

                      NORRINGTON
          A moment.

                    SWANN
          But --

                    NORRINGTON
          Please.

                    SWANN
          Dammit, man, it appears someone is
          stealing your ship!

Norrington glances out at the bay. Sure enough, the
Dauntless is on the move. Norrington takes a brass
telescope from his belt, opens it, trains it on --

The main deck. He picks out Will -

                    NORRINGTON
          Rash, Turner, too rash.

-- then spots Jack, at the wheel. Lowers the telescope.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          That is, without doubt, the worst
          pirate I have ever seen.

EXT. H . M. S. DAUNTLESS - DAY

Out in the open sea, Jack leans on the wheel, relaxed; not
much sailing to do with a following wind. Will looks back -

                    WILL
          They're coming!

He points: the sails of the Interceptor fill out, and the
ship cuts through the water toward them-

EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Norrington's smaller ship quickly comes alongside the
slowmoving Dauntless. Its decks appear empty. Grappling
hooks are thrown, and sailors draw the two ships together.

Norrington's men swarm across.

                    NORRINGTON
          Search every cabin, every hold,
          down to the bilges!

PULL BACK, away from the   Dauntless, and past the railing of
the Interceptor, where a   single SENTRY stands watch -- and
we find a soaked Jack and   Will as they climb up over the
side of the smaller ship,   unseen.

Jack tackles the Sentry from behind, covers hi1rmouth.

                    JACK
          Can you swim?
              (the man struggles)
          Can. You. Swim?

Jack removes his hand.

                    SENTRY
          Of course, sir. Like a fish. I
          grew up summers living in Dover,
          with my uncle -

                    JACK
          Good.

Jack lifts the man up, throws him overboard. Quickly unties
the ropes to the grappling hooks. Will cranks the capstan
bars, raising the foresail -

EXT. H . M. S. DAUNTLESS - DAY

Norrington emerges from a gangway -- and sees his other
ship moving away.

                    NORRINGTON
          Sailors! Back to the Interceptor!

But the distance is already too great. One brave sailor
tries to swing across on a rope, Errol-Flynn style, but
falls short with a splash.

Jack waves, and shouts across the distance -

                    JACK
          Thank you, Commodore, for getting our
          ship ready to make way! We'd've had a
          hard time of it by ourselves!

Norrington seethes, but his order to Gillette is measured:

                    NORRINGTON
          Raise the sails.

                    GILLETTE
          The wind is quarter from astern
          ... by the time we're underway,
          we'll never catch them.

                    NORRINGTON
          We need only to come about, to put
          them in range of the long nines.

Gillette looks surprised at the order -- but relays it.

                    GILLETTE
          Hands! Come about! Jackets off the
          cannons!
              (to Norrington)
          We are to fire on our own ship?

                    NORRINGTON
          Better to see it at the bottom of the
          sea than in the hands of a pirate.

The STEERSMAN turns the wheel. The Dauntless' course does
not change one whit.

                    STEERSMAN
          Captain, there's a problem.

The Steersman spins the wheel. It goes round and round,
with no signs of slowing.

                    STEERSMAN (CONT'D)
          He's disabled the rudder chain, sir.

                    NORRINGTON
          So it would seem.

The Interceptor dwindles with distance. Gillette watches it
go, with some degree of admiration.

                    GILLETTE
          He's got to be the best pirate
          I've ever seen.

Norrington reaches out, stops the spinning ship's wheel.

                    NORRINGTON
          So it would seem.

The Interceptor makes for the horizon line. A SLOW DISSOLVE
and with the time passage, the ship is gone; the sky turns
a deep twilight blue -

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - EVENING

-- with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon.
Suddenly, the edge of a black sail cuts into the
foreground, accompanied by the ROAR of the wind and the
SNAP of canvas -

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - EVENING

Elizabeth stalks the cabin. Pintel enters, carrying a black
silk dress.

                    PINTEL
          You'll be dining with the Captain,
          and he requests you wear this.

                    ELIZABETH
          Tell the captain that I am disinclined
          to acquiesce to his request.

                    PINTEL
              (happy)
          He said you say that! He also said if
          that be the case, you'll be dining with
          the crew, and you'll be naked.

Angry, Elizabeth holds out her hand. Pintel's grin fades.

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
              (hands it over)
          Fine.

He exits, pouting. Elizabeth examines the dress -

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Barbossa enters, followed by PIRATES carrying trays of
food, wine, table setting, etc. Elizabeth stands at the
small table in the dress -- lovely.

                    BARBOSSA
          Maid or not, it fits you.

                    ELIZABETH

          Dare I ask the fate of its previous
          owner?

                    BARBOSSA
          Now, none of that. Please dig in.

The table is set. Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of
meat, eats it daintily.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          No need to stand on ceremony, and no
          call to impress anyone. You must be
          hungry.

Elizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to
eat like it. Barbossa watches her intently.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Try the wine.

Elizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread,
devours it.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          And the apples -- one of those next.

She starts to bite into the apple -- stops. She is suddenly
aware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating.

                    ELIZABETH
          It's poisoned!

She shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to
palm her knife. Barbossa LAUGHS.

                    BARBOSSA
          Oh, there would be no sense in killing
          you, Miss Turner.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then why aren't you eating?

                    BARBOSSA
          Would that I could.

He produces the medallion, lets it dangle from his fingers.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

          Do you not know what this is,
          then?

                    ELIZABETH
          It's a pirate medallion.

                    BARBOSSA
          It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de
          Muerta .

Elizabeth gives an infinitesimal shrug, intrigued despite
herself.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT 'D)
          Ah, so you don't know as much as you
          pretend. Back when Cortes was cutting a
          great bloody swath through the New
          World, a high priest gave. him all the
          gold they had, with one condition: that
          he spare the people's lives. Of course,
          Cortes being Cortes, he didn't.
              (nods)
          He'd've made a great pirate, that one.

Barbossa stands, moves to a shelf. Puts a key to a medium-
sized polished wooden box -- the Captain's chest. Opens it.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          So the priest, with his dying breath,
          called on the power of the blood of his
          people, and put on the gold a curse. If
          anyone took so much as a single piece,
          as he was compelled by greed, by greed
          he would be consumed.

Inside the chest are charts, some gold, a sextant -- and a

few pages of a Mayan CODEX, pieces of tree bark inscribed
with Mayan glyphs. Barbossa removes them carefully, sets
them on the table. Pours over them.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Within a day of leaving port for Spain,
          the treasure ship carrying the gold ...
          something went wrong. The ship run
          aground, every man aboard dead, save
          one. He survived long enough to hide
          the gold ashore.

              (beat)
          Over time, the dark magic of the curse
          seeped into the place, making it a
          cursed island. An island of death. Isla
          de Muerta.

He looks up. Elizabeth has been rapt, involved in the story
-but feigns a dismissive attitude.

                    ELIZABETH
          That's all very interesting, but I
          hardly believe in ghost stories
          any more.

Barbossa is angry. He stands, sweeps the food off the
table.

                    BARBOSSA
          You idiot girl! It's no make-
          believe! My crew and I, we found
          the gold, and we did more than
          take one piece, we took it all.
          Rich men we were and we spent it
          and traded it and gave it away in
          exchange

for drink and food and pleasant company. But we found out:
the drink could not sate us, and the food turned to ashes
in our mouths, and no amount of pleasant company could ease
our torment.

(regains his composure)

We are cursed men, Miss Turner,

condemned, to be forever consumed by our own greed. Gold
calls to UB, always, and we are driven, always, to find
more, and add it to the treasure.

Barbossa picks up the priceless Codex. Crushes them in his
fist.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          There is but one way to remove the
          curse. All of the scattered pieces
          of the treasure must be restored
          in full, and the blood repaid.

                 (he throws the pages
                  aside)
             We've recovered every piece --
             save for this.
                 (holds up the medallion)
             And as for the blood ... that's
             what we have you for.
                 (pleasant, finally
                  getting to his point)
             And that's why there's no sense in
             killing you. Yet.

Elizabeth stares at him, horrified. Using the toe of his
boot, Barbossa flips an apple up off the floor, catches it,
extends it to Elizabeth.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             Apple?

Elizabeth slowly reaches for the apple -- and then comes up
out of her chair, trying to run around Barbossa_ They
struggle briefly, and then suddenly he shoves her away-

Elizabeth's stolen KNIFE is buried in Barbossa's chest, to
the hilt --

Barbossa is completely unaffected. He opens his shirt to
get a better look at the knife, pulls it out with little
effort. There is BLOOD on the blade, but none anywhere
else.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             I'm curious -- after killing me,
             what is it you were planning to do
             next?

Elizabeth backs away, whirls and barrels out the door -

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

-- Elizabeth comes to dead stop. She stares, her jaw
working, trying to scream but unable to -

The pirate crew works at their stations, coiling lines,
navigating the ship, swabbing decks -- but where the
moonlight falls across their bodies, they are nauqht but
SKELETONS. .

Elizabeth turns away from the sight -

Barbossa stands just inside the doorway, out of the
moonlight. He grabs her roughly by the shoulders and jerks
her back around -- Elizabeth shuts her eyes -

                    BARBOSSA
          Look!
              (shakes her)
          LOOK! The moonlight shows us for
          what we really are! We are not
          among the living and so we cannot
          die -

He spins her back around to face him -- he leans forward,
putting his face in the moonlight, turning it into a
gleaming SKULL with gold and silver teeth -

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          -- but neither are we dead! We
          have all the desires of the
          living, but cannot satisfy them!
          Ten years I have been parched of
          thirst, and unable to quench it!
          Ten years, I have been starving to
          death -- and haven't died!
              (raises his hand)

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          And I have not felt anything for
          ten years ... Not the wind on my
          face, nor the spray of the sea ...
              (reaches toward
               Elizabeth)
          ... nor the flesh of a woman ...

Elizabeth flinches away from the skeletal hand. It drops
away -- he takes a bottle of wine from the opened case
beside the cabin door, uncorks it with his teeth, raises it
-

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You'd best start believing in
          ghost stories, Miss Turner.
          Because now you're in one.

He tilts the bottle and drinks -- it runs over his jaw,
through his rib cage, drenching his clothes.

Elizabeth darts around him, back into the cabin, and shuts
the door. Barbossa hurls the bottle away.

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT

Elizabeth huddles in the far corner of the cabin,
terrified.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Interceptor cuts across the waves. Jack at the wheel;
Will tightens a line, moves back astern.

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - MAIN DECK - DAY

Will sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk
...

                    JACK
          For a man whose made an industry
          of avoiding boats, you're a quick
          study.

                     WILL
          I worked passage   from England as a
          cabin boy.
              (an attempt  at guile)
          After my mother  passed, I came out
          here ... looking  for my father.

                    JACK
          Is that so?

                    WILL
          My father. William Turner?

Jack says nothing. Will has lost the patience for guile.

                    WILL ( CONT ' D)
          I'm not a simpleton. At the jail -
          - it was only after you learned my
          name that you agreed to help.
              (a smile)
          Since that's what I wanted, I
          didn't press the matter. But now -

{an accusation}

You knew my father.

Jack considers his reply -- settles on 'truth.'

                    JACK
          I knew him. Probably one of the
          few who knew him as William
          Turner. Most everyone just called
          him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill.

                    WILL
          'Bootstrap?'

                    JACK
          Good man. Good pirate. And clever
          -"- I never met anyone with as
          clever a mind and hands as him.
          When you were puzzling out that
          cell door, it was like seeing his
          twin.

                    WILL
              (angry)
          That's not true.

                    JACK
          I swear, you look just like him.

                    WILL
          It's not true that my father was a
          pirate.

                    JACK
          Figured you wouldn't want to hear
          it.

                    WILL
          He was a merchant marine! He was a
          respectable man who obeyed the
          law, and followed the rules--

                    JACK
              (laughs)
          You think your father is the only
          man who ever lived the Glasgow
          life, telling folk one thing, and
          then going off to do another?
          There's quite a few who come here,
          hoping to amass enough swag to
          ease the burdens of respectable

          life. And they're all 'merchant
          marines.'

                    WILL
          My father did not think of my
          mother -his family -- as a burden.

                    JACK
          Sure -- because he could always go
          pirating.

                    WILL
          My father -- was not -- a pirate!

Will's sword is out, levelled at Jack. Jack gives him a
disbelieving look, sighs.

                    JACK
          Put it away, Will. It's not worth
          getting beat again.

                    WILL
          You didn't beat me. You ignored
          the rules of engagement. In a fair
          fight, I'd kill you.

                    JACK
          Then that's not much incentive for
          me to fight fair, is it?

He kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and
slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His
sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles above the water.

Jack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the
course. Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it.
Will hand-over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the
boom.

                    JACK ( CONT ' D)
          As long as you're just hanging
          there, pay attention. Must,
          Should, do, don't, shall, shall
          not -- those are just suggestions.
          There are only two absolute rules.
              (ticks them off on his
               fingers)

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          What a man can do. And what a man
          can I t do.

Will looks away, not interested.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          For instance: you can accept that
          your father was a pirate and still
          a good man... or you can't. Now
          me, I can sail this ship to
          Tortuga, by myself. . .
              (Will looks alarmed)
          But I can't just let you drown.

Jack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack
holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at
Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him
coolly.

Will turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down,
and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk
...

Jack breathes silent sigh of relief. Notices his hand is
shaking -- he takes the wheel.

                     WILL
          Tortuga?

                    JACK
          Oh -- did I forget to mention
          that?

EXT. TORTUGA - DAY

A dank and dirty port, where the tides seem to have swept
together the scum of the Caribbean -- pirates, privateers,
prostitutes, thieves, and drunkards.

With its cantered, rotting docks, weatherbeaten buildings,
and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey,
chickens, etc. -- it is far less civilized than Port Royal.

Jack and Will move through the crowd. A REDHEADED woman
turns her head -- she has noticed Jack.

                     JACK

          We need a crew. We can manage the
          ship between islands, but the open
          sea, that's another matter -

Suddenly the Redhead SLAPS Jack, hard. Satisfied, she turns
and strides off. Will ignores her.

                    WILL
          Just do it quickly.

                    JACK
              (rubbing his jaw)
          Don't worry. I've already got my
          Quartermaster -- there!

Jack leads Will toward a pub: the Faithful Bride, the
emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a
smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled
hands.

Jack pulls open the door; Will goes inside passing a pretty
ASIAN women coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately
SLAPS him, cursing something in Chinese. Jack backs away -

INT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY

Jack closes the door on the woman, joins Will. They take in
the place -- it is populated with a slightly higher class
of scum. Jack spots a BARTENDER, smiles, moves forward -

--and is suddenly DECKED by a waitress. This is ANAMARIA,
tall, strong, tough; she didn't spill a drink off her tray.

                    ANAMARIA
          You stole my boat.

                    JACK
          AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I
          need to put together -

She SLAPS him again. Will shakes his head, heads for the
bar. Jack gets up.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Borrowed. Borrowed your boat.
              (off her look)
          Without permission.

AnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between
them. She chases him around the table, still carrying the
tray.

                    ANAMARIA
          My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is
          it?

                    JACK
          Safe! At Port Royal. With the
          Royal Navy.

                    ANAMARIA
          That boat is my livelihood!

                    JACK
          You'll get it back. Or one better.

                    ANAMARIA
              (a threat)
          I will.

Away from them, a PATRON calls for his food. AnaMaria
scowls at Jack, moves away -- comes back for. one more
SLAP!

                    WILL
          Jack! Over here!

AT THE BAR, Will has spoken to the Bartender. Jack arrives,
rubbing his chin.

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          He knows Gibbs.

The Bartender nods 'yes.' Then nods 'out back.' Then
produces a water bucket from behind the bar.

Jack and Will exchange a look,-and Jack takes the bucket.

EXT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - REAR - DAY

A drunken man lays in the mud, having a friendly
conversation with two pigs. He wears an old tattered Navy
jacket.

A sudden SPRAY OF WATER splashes across his face,
revealing: this is old JOSHAMEE GIBBS (the man who told

pirate stories to Elizabeth when she was a child). He
sputters and roars:

                    GIBBS
          Curse you for breathing, you
          slack-jawed idiot
              (recognizes Jack)
          Mother's love, Jack, you know
          better than to wake a man when
          he's sleeping. It's bad luck!

                    JACK
          Well, fortunately, I know how to
          counter it. The man who did the waking
          buys the man who was sleeping a drink,
          and the man who was sleeping it drinks
          it while listening to a proposition.

                    GIBBS
          Aye, that'll about do it.

Jack helps Gibbs to his feet -- and then Gibbs is hit with
a second wave of water. Will stands there with the bucket.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Blast it, I'm already awake!

                    WILL
          I know. That was for the smell.

INT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY

Jack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single
candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices. Will is
away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look-
out.

A tankard is set down. Gibbs lifts it to take a swig -

                    JACK
          Just the one.

Gibbs pauses. He takes a dainty sip.

                    GIBBS
          Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the
          nature of this venture of yours?

                    JACK

          First -- have you found me a crew?

                    GIBBS
          Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack.
          Most of the decent pirates in town
          won't sail with you -- seem to
          think you're a jinx.

                    JACK
          Now where, I wonder, would they
          have gotten that idea?

Gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip. Jack leans
forward. Gibbs leans forward.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I'm going after the Black Pearl.

Gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. He
reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it
back down. He leans forwards again. Jack has not moved.

                       GIBBS
          Say again?

                    JACK
          Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I
          know where its going to be, and
          I'm going to take it.

                     GIBBS
          Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've
          heard the tales they tell about
          the Pearl.

                    JACK
          Aye, and that's why I know where it's
          going to be, and that's why I know what
          Barbossa is up to. All I need is a
          crew.

                    GIBBS
              (shakes his head)
          A fool's errand.

                       JACK

          Not if the fool has something
          Barbossa wants. Something he
          needs.

                    GIBBS
          And you've got that, have you?

ANGLE ON: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his
eyes' -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor
away from the table.

                    JACK
          Back there, guarding the door is
          the son of old Bootstrap Bill
          Turner.

Gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers at
Will. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones.

                    GIBBS
          Well, lookee there. I'll allow you
          may be onto something, Jack.
              (considers, nods)
          There's bound to be sailors on
          this rock crazy as you. I'll find
          some men.

Gibbs downs the drink, SLAMS the tankard on the table.

Will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger,
kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who
moves.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?

                    JACK
          That he is.

EXT. TORTUGA - DOCK - LATER - DAY

On the docks, a disheveled, motley and weatherbeaten group
of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up.

                    GIBBS
          Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em
          good sea-faring men, faithful hands
          before the mast, every one worth his
          salt --

              (sotto, making his point)
          -- and crazy, to boot.

Jack holds up a hand -- enough. He moves down the line,
Gibbs at his side. Then he notices AnaMaria in line,
dressed like a man, He raises an eyebrow.

                    ANAMARIA
          You owe me a boat.

Jack nods, continues. One sailor is quite fat, another
thin and sickly. Jack is not happy with his choices.

He stops in front of COTTON, a short sailor with a large,
colorful PARROT on his shoulder. Jack raises an eyebrow.

                    GIBBS
          Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor
          devil had his tongue cut out --

Cotton opens his mouth to show this -- Jack grimaces.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          -- so he went and trained the parrot to
          do the talking for him, nobody knows
          how. Nobody knows the parrot's name,
          neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's
          parrot.'

Jack decides to test this.

                    JACK
          Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage
          and fortitude to follow orders and stay
          true, in the face danger, and almost
          certain death?

Cotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it --

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS!

                    GIBBS
          Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.'

Cotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goes
silent. Jack shakes his head. Steps back.

                    JACK

          That goes for the rest of you!
          Danger and near certain death.
              (turns away)
          For we are to sail for the Isla de
          Muerta, to rescue the daughter of
          Governor Swann. An equal share of the
          reward shall be -

Jack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crew
members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn
and run, followed by more.

Soon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (with
parrot) -- and AnaMaria.

                    WILL
          Shut up, before you lose them all!

                    JACK
          These are the only ones worth
          having.
              (glances at the sky)
          And we're going to need them-

EXT. H. M. S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

A FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder. The canvas
of every sail is stretched taut. The ship rocks as it drops
into the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side.

On board, the new crew members scurry about their tasks,
pulling lines and trimming sails. Excellent sailors, it
takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat.

AnaMaria is at the helm. Gibbs staggers along the deck.

                    GIBBS
          That fool will have us lose the
          canvas, and the masts besides!

On Jack, a ROARING wind blowing back his hair, eyes intent
on their course. Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)
          Werd best drop canvas, sirl

                    JACK
          She can hold a bit longer.

The wind picks up, howling. Jack smiles.

                    GIBBS
              (shouts)
          What's in your head to put you in such
          a fine mood?

                    JACK
              (shouts)
          We're catching up!

Jack turns back to the sea, enjoying himself. Gibbs stares
at him like he's a crazy man.'

INT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - DAY

The sound of RAIN pounds down on the deck above - - then
suddenly stops. Elizabeth moves to the stern windows, looks
out at the rolling sea below -- no escape there.

She hears the sound of a VQICE calling, gazes up, wondering
-

EXT. BLACK PEARL - CROW' S NEST - DAY

High on the main mast, Twigg cups his hands to his face, calls
down:

                    TWIGG
          Isla de Muerta! Isla de Muerta,
          off the port bow!

ON DECK, Barbossa moves to the rail. The storm clouds are
breaking up. On the horizon is a dark, ominous shape: ISLA DE
MUERTA. Mostly sheer unfriendly cliffs that shoot straight into
the water. It is surrounded by a slate grey sea.

Barbossa grasps the rail with both hands, his expression a
mixture of loathing and fear. Jacoby approaches, hesitant.

                    JACOBY
          Orders, Captain?

                    BARBOSSA
          Bring her in, not too close. I won't
          brave the reef, not until high tide. We
          lay anchor before dark.

Jacoby nods, backs away. Barbossa continues to stare -

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          ... that is, if it first doesn't
          sink back down to hell from where
          it came.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Interceptor, on open waters, glorious, her white sails
set wing-to-wing.

EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

CLOSE ON: Jack's compass, cradled in both hands. Jack leans
over and studies it -- almost like he's praying.

ON THE COMPASS -- the face shows old-fashioned rose petal
style direction markers below a quivering indicator that
settles on -- southeast.

                    JACK
          Bear three points starboard.

AnaMaria turns the wheel, adjusting course. The ship leans
into the new direction. Jack looks down -

ON THE COMPASS -- where the indicator spins, reverses,
settles on -- northeast.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Six points port!

AnaMaria frowns, but follows the order, turns the wheel
back, and the ship responds.

Will works on deck, coiling a rope -- but he watches Jack
and AnaMaria, clearly not happy. Gibbs hobbles up.

                    GIBBS
          Left handed-ropes are coiled against
          the sun, or it's bad luck!
              (twirls a finger)
          Anty-clockwise.

Gibbs takes over the task. The ship shifts course again.
Will has had enough.

                    WILL

          How do we expect to find an island no
          one can find -- with a compass that
          doesn't work?

                    GIBBS
          Now, lad, just because it don't point
          north don't mean it don't work.
              (voice low)
          That compass gives bearings to the Isla
          de Muerta, wherever it may lie.

                    WILL
          Really?
              (moves closer)
          So ... what's the story on the
          pistol?

Gibbs settles in, happy to have a willing listener.

                    GIBBS
          I'll tell lee. Now, Jack Sparrow
          has an honest streak in him, and
          that's where the whole problem
          starts. This was when he was
          Captain of the Black Pearl -

                    WILL
          What? He never told me that.

                    GIBBS
          Ah -- he's learned, then. Plays things
          more close to the vest. See, Jack was a
          cartographer, back in Old England.
          Somehow I he came by the money to
          commission the Pearl. Hired himself a
          crew, promised each man an equal share.
              (lowers his voice)
          So, they're forty days out, and the
          First Mate says, everything's an equal
          share, that should mean the location of
          the island, too. So Jack gave up the
          bearings.
              (shakes his head)
          That night, there was mutiny.

Gibbs voice is a whisper, now, so Will has to lean closer.

                    GIBBS (CONT'D)

          Jack gave hisself up for the sake of
          his loyal crewmen. He was marooned on
          an island, left there to die.

                    WILL
          How did he get off the island?

                    JACK
              (loud)
          I didn't!

Will and Gibbs jump. Jack is right there beside them.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          My body's still there, rotting
          away, and I am but a ghost!

Will and Gibbs aren't sure what to make of that. Jack
laughs.

                    GIBBS
          How did you get off the island?

                    JACK
          Ah, that's a dark and unpleasant
          tale, best left untold.

He starts off.

                    WILL
          Wait -- what about the pistol?

                    JACK
          The pistol. When a pirate is marooned,
          Will, he's given a pistol with a single
          shot. No good for hunting, or
          surviving, really. But after three
          weeks of starvation and thirst -- the
          option of that pistol begins to look
          good.

Jack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          But I survived. And I still have
          that single shot. It's meant for
          one man. My mutinous first mate -

                    WILL

          Barbossa.

Jack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

On Barbossa, face upturned. No expression in his eyes.

Around him a group of pirates, Elizabeth among them, stand
as still as stones, in front of a dark cave opening. Their
faces look upward, their total lack of movement
disconcerting.

Above the cave, on a hillock, the pirate Koehler gazes out
toward the horizon. Slowly he TRANSFORMS, head-to-toe, from
pirate to SKELETON-

The MOON has climbed free of the storm clouds, rising
large. and full on the horizon. The skeleton turns -

                    KOEHLER
          Moonrise, Captain! First night of full.

                      BARBOSSA
          Hah!
              (to the pirates)
          Be mindful of pits and crevasses.
          Stay together.

He takes a torch. Moves into the cave. The pirates follow.

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE -     CAVES    - NIGHT

The group keeps together under the firelight. The path
leads between boulders on a slope downhill. From the echoes
and shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge.

Elizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off
to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins.
Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness.

Twigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away from
the group. Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm.

                    BARBOSSA
          Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd
          die and miss Judgement Day -- for not
          even the Lord himself'll come look for
          you here.

Barbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twisting
and turning, but always down -

EXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - NIGHT

Cotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something. He
lifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along the
back.

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND
          ho!

Indeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the
distance on the port side. Will stands, excited, jumps onto
the rigging for a better look.

But AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and the
parrot.

                    ANAMARIA
          How does he do that?

                    JACK
          They'll be anchored on the lee side.
          Haul your wind, and keep to the weather
          of the island -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVES - NIGHT

Flickering torchlight. Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern
-

-- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de

Muerta: overflowing ,chests of coins, gold and silver
ingots, jewelry, objects d' art, jade and ivory, brightly
colored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors and
swords -anything and everything of value that might be
carried by ship, is here.

The pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze in
wonder.

                    ELIZABETH
          The curse drove you to gather
          this?

                    BARBOSSA (O.S.)

          Aye. And not a bit of it any use
          to us, only hoarded. But it will
          drive us no longer.

Elizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted
mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - LAGOON - NIGHT

The Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance. Closer,
Jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a small
longboat, toward the rocky shore.

The RUSH of a waterfall grows louder. Will looks: ahead of
them is a black CAVE MOUTH, right at water level.

                    WILL
          What's that?

                     JACK
          Depends.

                     WILL
          On what?

                    JACK
          On whether the stories are    all
          true. If they are, that's    a
          waterfall that spills over    at high
          tide, with a short drop to    an
          underground lagoon. If not    -

By now, the moving water tugs on the longboat, and they are
sucked in --

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          -- well, too late.

The boat rushes forward, plunges into the darkness -

INT. CAVES - UNDERWATER LAGOON - NIGHT

-- the longboat takes a harrowing drop over a short
waterfall ... but then lands safely in a gorgeous
underwater lagoon, floats lazily toward a sandy shore.

                    JACK
          Chalk one up for the stories.

Will leaps out into the water, pulls the boat ashore -

INT. CAVES - BED CAVERN - NIGHT

The pirate group reaches the end of a small chamber of
mostly jewels and pearl piled around a large bed -

INT. CAVES - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

-- and then emerge into the largest cavern of all, also
crammed with treasure, including several mountains of gold
coins that reach the ceiling. Treasure everywhere -

Except for one spot in the center. A hole in the ceiling
lets in a column of moonlight, which illumines:

A stone chest, lid pushed back, decorated with carved Aztec
glyphs, filled with gold coins identical to Will's
medallion. A sharp stone knife lies on top.

In front of it, buried in the sand is a skeleton -- and
this one doesn't look like it's going to move ever again,
judging by the sword in its back. A crab scurries away from
it as the group approaches.

                    BARBOSSA
          Here we stand before the cursed
          treasure of Cortez himself. Won by
          blood, it demands blood in return.

All eyes turn -- onto Elizabeth. Pintle takes the stone
knife from the chest, approaches her. Elizabeth shrinks
back, but is held by two other pirates.

Pintel grins. Grabs her by the wrist. She turns her head
away, shuts her eyes.

Pintle raises the knife ...

... and then very carefully, daintily, uses just the sharp
tip of the knife to just prick! Elizabeth's finger.

One tiny red drop of blood appears, and drips down onto the
medallion.

Elizabeth opens her eyes, surprised.

                    PINTEL

             What did you expect? We're all
             gentlemen here, right and proper.

The pirates laugh. Barbossa takes the medallion, grins at
Elizabeth.

                       BARBOSSA
             You know the first thing I'm going
             to do after the curse is lifted?
                 (grins)
             Eat a whole bushel of apples.

Barbossa approaches the chest, shining in the beam of

moonlight.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             What was begun by blood, let blood
             now end!

He tosses the gold medallion onto the others.

The pirates tense, waiting, expectant. A long beat. They
all look at each other, look at themselves. Nothing
happens.

                       KOEHLER
             Did it work?

                       DEADEYE
             I don't feel no different.

                       JACOBY
             How do we tell?

Barbossa frowns, draws his pistol, and SHOOTS the pirate
next to him -- Jacoby -- square in the chest. Jacoby reacts
in shock, grabs his chest ... but doesn't die.

                       KOEHLER
             You're not dead.

                       JACOBY
             No.
                 (realizes)
             He shot me!

                       TWIGG

          It didn't work! The curse is still
          upon us!

Barbossa searches his mind for an answer ... turns to
Elizabeth.

                     BARBOSSA
          You. Maid. Your father. What was
          his name?!
              (grabs her roughly)
          Was your father William Turner?!

Elizabeth takes time to smile before answering:

                    ELIZABETH
          No.

The pirates cry out in alarm. Barbossa gathers himself,
getting his rage under steely control.

                    BARBOSSA
          Where's his child? The child that
          sailed from England eight years
          ago, the child who is the real
          owner of that medallion, the child
          in whose veins flows the blood of
          William Turner?! Where?

Barbossa SLAPS her hard across the face, sending her
sprawling.

                    JACOBY
              (to Pintel)
          You brought us the wrong person!

                    PINTEL
          She had the medallion! She's the
          right age. She said her name was
          Turner!

                    TWIGG
              (to Barbossa)
          You brought us here for nothing?

Barbossa whirls on him --

                    BARBOSSA

          If you had sailed with Morgan for
          ten years like I have, you'd know
          not to question me!

Elizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment
unnoticed. Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above
her.

Startled, Elizabeth looks up --

-- Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down
with his scabbard for her to grab onto.

Elizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied
medallion from the pile. Reaches back, grabs the scabbard.
Will pulls her up -

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          If any coward here dare challenge
          me, let him speak! Any more talk,
          I'll chain ye to a cannon and send
          ye to the watery depths!

A sound catches his attention -- coins falling. He looks
up, sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure
stack.

ATOP THE STACK, Will grabs a large shield, flings them
forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the
far side, slide through a small opening -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - SMALL CAVERN - NIGHT

Behind them, loose coins from their slide come down in an
avalanche, sealing the entrance.

Elizabeth jumps up, silver platter in hand, ready to swing
-Jack catches her before she can do any damage. They
recognize each other.

                    ELIZABETH
          You?!

                    JACK
          Me!

                    ELIZABETH
          You're in league with Barbossa!

                    JACK
          No, I'm -- rescuing you.

Elizabeth can't comprehend that one.

                      ELIZABETH
          You?!

Will gains his footing in the rubble.

                     WILL
          Miss Swann! We're here to rescue
          you!
               (sounds of pursuit,
                approaching)
          It's going badly!

                      JACK
          This way!

They race off, toward a bit of moonlight -

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

The three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the
island. Will takes Elizabeth's hand, helps her.

                    WILL
          I'm glad we got here in time.

                    ELIZABETH
          Truthfully -- you were a bit late.

                    JACK
          The trick isn't getting here, it's
          getting away.

As if on cue, they hear the yells of pirates, coming
closer. They take off -

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CLEARING - NIGHT

The three race through the rocks, the sounds of pursuit
close behind. Suddenly Jack stops.

                      ELIZABETH
          Come on!

                      JACK

          No. This won't work.
              (a quick decision)
          I'll stay behind, and fight them.
          You go on.

Will and Elizabeth stare at him.

                    WILL
          No.

                    JACK
          I'll lead them away.

The sounds are closer.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Go to the opposite end of the
          island, and signal the ship. I'll
          keep 'em busy.

                    WILL
          Are you sure? Jack -- this is not
          something you have to do.

                    JACK
          I'm sure. When you've led the kind
          of life I have, there are debts
          that must be paid. Maybe I can
          balance the scales a little.

Will nods, hesitates... gives Jack his sword - - now Jack
has two, ..one for each hand. Elizabeth gives him a quick
kiss.

Will and Elizabeth race away, and are gone.

Jack watches them for a moment, turns to face the pirates.
He sticks the two swords in the ground, crossed. Leans
casually against a rock.

A group of pirates round a corner, cutlasses drawn, ready
to fight -- but Jack raises his hand.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I invoke the right of parlay,
          according to the Code of the
          Brethren, set down by the pirates
          Morgan and Bartholomew...

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

Jack stands before Barbossa, surrounded by pirates. Jack
has a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesn't like
it.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'm inclined to kill you now, Jack
          Sparrow, without so much as a
          word, if you don't lose that grin
          from your face.

Jack's smile remains. Barbossa puts a hand to his cutlass -

                    JACK
          The woman's blood didn't work, did
          it?

Barbossa hesitates.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          I know who's blood you need, to
          end the curse.

                    BARBOSSA
          Say the name, or I slit your
          throat.

                    JACK
          No you won't.

Barbossa nods. Pintel steps forward, puts a blade to Jack's
throat. Jack's smile widens.

                      PINTEL
          Now?

                      BARBOSSA (NODS)
          Now.
              (Pintel grins)
          No, don't kill him.

Surprised, Pintel lowers his cutlass. Jack's expression
hasn't changed.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Allow me the humor of listening to
          your terms.

                    JACK
          Simple. I have something you want more
          than anything. The way to free you from
          the curse of the treasure. You have
          something I want -- more than anything.

                     BARBOSSA
          The Pearl?
              (laughs)
          Oh, that's fine. And just how do
          you expect this to work?

                    JACK
          You give me the Pearl. Then I tell
          you who you need.

Barbossa stares at him, incredulous.

                    BARBOSSA
          That's your offer? You, sailing
          away nice and pretty with the
          Black Pearl, and all I have is a
          name?

                    JACK
          That's right.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'm supposed to ... trust you?

The pirates laugh.

                    JACK
          I'm a man of my word.

The pirates laugh louder.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          You see, I've got this honest streak in me
          -- in its own way, a sort of curse. Oh, and
          there's the fact that you have no choice.

                    BARBOSSA
          I'll torture it out of you.

                    JACK
          You left me on a desert island --
          what worse can you do?

Jack is still smiling, intentionally smug now. Barbossa
sees his options dwindling, begins to pace.

                    BARBOSSA
          Blast you! I'll throw you in
          prison.

                    JACK
          Wait as long as you like.

                    BARBOSSA
          You're setting me up for a double
          cross, you with the ship, and me with
          nothing more than your word!

                    JACK
          Let's say I tell you the wrong
          person. What would you do?

                    BARBOSSA
          Track you down and -

He sees where Jack is headed.

                    JACK
          And if I tell you the truth, you become
          mortal, and you won't come near me
          because you know I'd kill you.

Barbossa hesitates. The pirates are amazed at how the tide
has turned; Barbossa has gone past considering the idea,
and might even do it.

                    BARBOSSA
          Jack, I don't trust you, and
          that's a fact. Never trust a
          smiling man, you can lay to that.

                    JACK
          See, that's where we're different.
          I trust you ... to do what it
          takes to get what you want.

                    BARBOSSA
          You're playing this as close to
          the edge as any man, I'll give you
          that.
              (decides, smiles)

             We might just have to sign
             articles, you and I. Jack, you're
             a pirate at heart, that's certain.

Jack nods.

                       BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
             Pintel ... set sail. If this fool plan
             is to work, we'll need the medallion,
             and that means catching the ship which
             brought 'em here.

Jack is caught completely off guard. For the first time,
his smile fades.

                       JACK
             What -- you don't have the medallion?

                       BARBOSSA
             That fool woman took it. You be
             careful around her, Jack -- she's
             pretty enough, she'll steal your
             heart -- but pure evil inside.

                       JACK
             I'll watch my back.

                       BARBOSSA
             Bosun! Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters,
             nice and fine ... in the brig.
                 (to Jack, a smile)
             Meaning no disrespect, of course.

Jack nods, and is taken away. Barbossa stares after him,
not hiding his mistrust.

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

At full sail, headed out to sea. Gibbs glances at Elizabeth
and Will, talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his
head.

                       GIBBS
             Two women on board? A man don't have to
             be superstitious to know that's
             trouble.

Elizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale:

                    ELIZABETH
          ... you were in danger ... so I took
          the medallion. And I've kept it ever
          since. They thought I was you, that
          they needed my blood. And it didn't
          work.

She hands him the medallion.

                    WILL
          Why would my father send this to me?

                    ELIZABETH
          To keep it away from them? No pirate
          would sail to London, for fear of
          Execution Dock.

                    WILL
          If I had known-

                    ELIZABETH
              (anticipating him)
          -- then we never would have met.

Will nods. They hold each other's gaze a moment. Will turns
away first, leans on the rail. Looks out to sea, back the
direction they came.

                    WILL
          I can't believe he would make such
          a sacrifice for us.

                    ELIZABETH
          I guess you can never truly know
          someone else's heart.

Will glances at her, and nods.

AT THE HELM, Gibbs peers forward, scanning the horizon.
There

is a tiny island in front of them.

                    GIBBS
          Shift your heading, steer clear of that
          island. Fifteen degrees starboard.

On the aft deck, Cotton concentrates on his work, securing
a halyard. Suddenly Cotton's parrot flaps its wings, takes
off, lands on the starboard bulwark, squawking -

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell
          NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales!

Cotton looks up - on the horizon, following: black sails.
Gibbs and AnaMaria appear, and see the ship.

                    ANAMARIA
          Can we outrun them?

                    GIBBS
          Not a chance. Make for the reef.

EXT. CARIBBEAN OCEAN - DAY

Miles of blue water. The Interceptor tacks, leaving a long
white wake. The Black Pearl matches it -- gaining.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY

Barbossa and Pintel eye the Interceptor, two hounds chasing
the fox.

                    PINTEL
          What's he doing? Is he going to
          run her aground?

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

The Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and
the Interceptor is headed for the island.

                    GIBBS
          Drop the forward anchor!

A SAILOR at the stern of the ship pulls a release, and the

ship's anchor races down into the water, the metal chain

jumping and twisting on deck.

The chain stops, and the Sailor locks it -

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

With its forward momentum and the anchor down, the
Interceptor to turn quickly, pivoting around the anchor.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY

Barbossa and Pintel watch as the huge ship brings its
cannons to bear right in front of them.

                    BARBOSSA
          All hands! Prepare to come about!

But for now, the Interceptor has the advantage, and takes
it:

its cannons boom, and cannonballs rain down.

INT. BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY

Jack sees what he can out the porthole. In the cell with
him is Twigg, acting as a guard.

                    JACK
          Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill
          the lying scoundrel -
              (to Twigg)
          I'm a little conflicted, here.

Twigg just stares.

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Elizabeth watches  as the Black Pearl comes about -- and
then there is the  low, loud RUMBLE of two dozen cannons
firing as one. The  Interceptor is hit. A barrage of shots
follow; most find  their mark.

Sailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they
are overmatched.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - PORT SIDE - DAY

Barbossa laughs.

                    BARBOSSA
          Strike your colors, you bloody
          cockroaches!

EXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY

Another round of fire; Barbossa shows no mercy.

                    ANAMARIA
          Looks like they mean to send us under.

                    GIBBS
          There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger,

upside down.

AnaMaria, Gibbs, Cotton, even Elizabeth -- all know what
this means. Will doesn't. He looks to Gibbs for an
explanation:

                    GIBBS (CONT 'D)
          It's a signal. If we resist, it won't
          just be death. There'll be torture as
          well.

                    WILL
          We're not going to just surrender!

GIBBS That we are.

The Black Pearl fires again, a double-ball shot with a
chain connecting the two. It hits the main mast dead ani a
CRACKING, SPLINTING sound as it breaks, falls to the deck.

Barbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board.

                    WILL
          We can at least fight -- we might
          be able to kill a few-

                    GIBBS
          Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for
          Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.

Will stares -- and nods. But his expression is still
defiant.

The deck slants; the ship is sinking. pirates swarm across
on ropes, and take control of the Interceptor.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY

The top masts of the H.M.S. Interceptor sink into the
smooth' crystal waters of the Caribbean -

-- as Will and Elizabeth, held by pirates, are brought
before Barbossa -- and see that Jack stands beside him,
manacled.

Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton and the other crewmembers huddle
together.

Barbossa's wrath falls on Elizabeth.

                    BARBOSSA
          Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board,
          you played me right clever, make
          pretending and all. I hope your stay
          this time is more pleasant. Boys, show
          her some hospitality!

He shoves her into a group of pirates; they yell their
approval. She is pushed from one to another.

This goads Will to action. He head-butts the pirate behind
him, grabs a pistol, waves it at the pirates.

                    WILL
          She goes free!

Will leaps onto the ship's rail. He steadies himself with a
hand on the rigging. Points the pistol at Barbossa.

                    BARBOSSA
          What's in your head, boy?

                    WILL
          She. Goes. Free.

                    BARBOSSA
          You've got one shot -- and we can't
          die.

                    WILL
          You can't. I can.

He leans out over the ocean.

                       ELIZABETH
          No!

Jack pushes forward.

                       JACK

          Will -- don't do anything stupid!
          Don't say anything stupid -

                    WILL
          My name is Will Turner, the son of
          Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs
          in my veins.
              (raises the gun to his head)
          You need my blood. And on my word I
          will pull this trigger, and sink all
          the way down to Davy Jones' Locker!

Pintel squints at Will; the pirates murmur surprise.

                    TWIGG
          It's true - he's the spittin' image of
          old Bootstrap. Even talks the same!

Jack drops his head. Barbossa grins at him.

                    BARBOSSA
          Looks like you're back to having
          nothing to offer.

                    PINTEL
          And hers got Old Bill's courage. A
          curse on him, and you!

Barbossa steps forward.

                    BARBOSSA
          Enough of that!
              (to Will)
          Name your terms.

                    WILL
          Elizabeth goes free!

                    BARBOSSA
          We got that part. Anything else?

                    WILL
          And Jack. And the crew. Free and
          unharmed. I f you agree... then...
          I will remain with you.

Barbossa considers; his crew waits. Finally -

                    BARBOSSA

          Agreed. You have my word, as a
          gentleman of fortune -

                    ELIZABETH
          Will -- you can't trust him.

                    WILL
          You must swear by the Holy Bible.

                    BARBOSSA
          Eh? You have my word, then -- on the
          Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord
          spare my worthless soul.

Barbossa crosses himself, as do many of his men.

Will lowers the gun ... steps down -- the pirates surround
him. They snatch away the pistol.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Boatswain! Take your captives
          belowdecks. Chain them in the galley,
          and teach 'em how to row.

Gibbs, AnaMaria, Cotton and the rest are led away under
guard. Barbossa looks out to sea, toward the islet.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Hah. Look there. That's the very
          same island we made Jack governor
          of on our last trip.
              (nods")
          When you sail the open sea as long as
          I, you learn to trust the signs fate
          sends your way.

                    GIBBS
              (dejected)
          Amen to that...

                    BARBOSSA
          Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my
          word and you're to be set free, right
          quick.
              (loudly)
          Men, break out the plank!

A CHEER goes up from the pirates. Will realizes what
Barbossa intends to do, struggles with his captors.

                    WILL
          No! You gave your word!

                    BARBOSSA
          Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue.
          Those as know me know I wouldn't cross
          my word, and bring down bad luck on the
          ship.
              (nods)
          I agreed to set them free. I didn't say
          when. .. nor where.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

The Black Pearl lies at anchor, closer now to the islet.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY

Jack, wrists still bound, stands in the classic 'walking
the plank' pose. Elizabeth is next in line. Pirates crowd
the ship's rail to watch.

                    JACK
          It's pure evil to make a Captain walk
          the plank of his own ship, twice in one
          lifetime. No good can come of it.

                    BARBOSSA
          Now, Jack. That reef is less than a
          league distant. It's a square deal all
          around, and you can't hope for better.

                    JACK
          Someone needs to cut these bonds, then.

Barbossa smiles, shows a pistol. Points it at Jack.

                    BARBOSSA
          You'd best take a swim, Jack.

                    JACK
          The last time you did this, you
          left me a pistol, with one shot.

The pirates mutter agreement.

                    PINTEL
          That's proper, sir, according to the
          code.

                    BARBOSSA
          By the Powers, you're right!
              ( turns around)
          Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got
          it? Bring it forward!

                    JACK
          A gentleman might give us two pistols,
          seeing as there are two of us, this
          time.

A pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa.

                    BARBOSSA
          Tell you what. I'll   give you one
          pistol, and let you   be the gentleman,
          an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death
          yourself!
              (grins)
          That is, presuming   you're not both drownded.

The pirates laugh. Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- but
over his head, and down into the water with a splash.

                    BARBOSSA (CONTID)
          So how did you get off that island,
          anyway?

                    JACK
          You can go to your grave not knowing.

                    BARBOSSA
          That's fair.

Jack glares at Barbossa. Then he's prodded with a cutlass,
takes a step out. Reaches the end of the plank -- steps
off.

Jack plunges down into the water. Appears on the surface,
floundering, struggles to stay afloat. Will and Elizabeth
exchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)

          The lady's next. But first, I'll be
          wanting that dress back, if you please.

Elizabeth hesitates ... then strips it off, leaving her in
a silk slip. She throws it at him.

                    ELIZABETH
          Here -- it will go well with your
          black heart !

Barbossa indicates the plank.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT' D)
          I will not walk into the ocean.
          You'll have to throw me in!

Barbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods.

                    BARBOSSA
          Have at her, lads!

The pirates rush to comply. Lift her up, toss her over the
rail -- with a scream she falls --

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - UNDERWATER - DAY

We follow Elizabeth amid foam and bubbles as she PLUNGES
down

through the water. Blue and clear, with streaks of sunlight
cutting down; bright coral and tropical fish, and a lovely
young woman in a silk dress. .. if it weren't for the
mortal danger, the scene could be described as gorgeous.

Elizabeth spots Jack, below her now, sinking, struggling.
She swims down ... unties his bonds.

Elizabeth starts for the surface. Inexplicably, Jack swims
the other way, further down into the depths.

EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY

Elizabeth breaks the surface, looks around. And then,
finally Jack appears, sucking in air. He shows what he went
after: his pistol. He tucks it into his shirt.

                    ELIZABETH
          You went back for that? We need to
          head for the reef!

She starts swimming. Jack hesitates. The Black Pearl is
already underway; he stares at it.

                    JACK
          That's the second time I've had to
          watch that man sail away with my ship.

He turns away, and swims after Elizabeth.

EXT. ISLET - BEACH - DAY

CLOSE ON: The surf line. Elizabeth's feet leave prints in
the sand ... and then meet up with matching footprints she
made earlier, going in the same direction. She has walked
all the way around the island.

                    JACK (O.S.)
          Not all that big, is it?

Jack lays on the beach. He has dismantled his pistol; the
parts, ball and powder dry on his scarf.

                     ELIZABETH
          Has it changed since the last time you
          were here?

                    JACK
          The trees are taller.

Jack checks to see if the pistol parts are dry; they are.
He sets about re-assembling and loading his pistol.

                    ELIZABETH
          I hope you have no intention of using
          that.

Jack has finished putting his pistol back together. He
shoves it in his belt, walks off.

                    JACK
          Not yet. Ask me again in a few weeks.

Elizabeth can't believe it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Captain Sparrow! We have to get
          off this island -- immediately!

                    JACK

          Don't be thinking I'm not already
          working on it.

He climbs up toward a clump of palm trees. Digs for
something beneath the sand. He finds it: a large iron ring.

                    ELIZABETH
          What is that? Is there a boat
          under there?

Jack heaves the trap door up and over, revealing a pit.
Inside are barrels and bottles of rum ... all covered with
dust and cobwebs, long abandoned. Jack's face falls.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          What? What's wrong? How will this
          help us get off the island?

                    JACK
          It won't. It won't, and so we
          won't.

He jumps down into the pit, cracks open a bottle of rum,.
takes a swig.

                    ELIZABETH
          But ... you did it before! Last
          time -

                    JACK
          Last time, I was here a grand
          total of three days. Last time,
          the rumrunners who used this
          island as a cache came by, and I
          bartered passage off.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          But from the looks of this,
          they've long been'out of business,
          and so that won't be happening
          again.
              (takes another swig)
          We probably have your friend
          Norrington to thank for that.

                    ELIZABETH
          So that's it? That's the secret
          grand adventure of the infamous

          Jack Sparrow? You spent three days
          on the beach drinking rum?

                    JACK
          Welcome to the Caribbean, love.

He gathers up a few bottles, heads for the beach.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          You should look at our contretemps
          this way: we've got shade trees,
          thank the Lord. We've got some
          food on the trees, thank the Lord
          again. And we've got rum, praise
          the Lord. We can stay alive a
          month, maybe more. Keep a weather
          eye open for passing ships, and
          our chances are fair.

                    ELIZABETH
          A month? Will doesn't have a
          month! We've got to do something
          to help him!

                    JACK
          You're right.
              (hoists the bottle)
          Here's luck to you, Will Turner.

He drinks -- and defiantly returns Elizabeth's angry gaze.
But then turns away, sits down.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Don't be thinking I'm happy about
          this, Elizabeth. But I see no use
          in wailing and gnashing my teeth
          over that which I can do nothing
          about.

                    ELIZABETH
          Not when you can drink instead, at
          least.

Jack tosses her a bottle.

                    JACK

          Try it. It goes down rough, but it
          goes down - - and the second swig
          goes down easier.

Elizabeth considers. Comes to a decision. She unseals the
bottle, takes a swig. They sit in silence for a bit.

                    ELIZABETH
          And you will call me Miss Swann.

Jack toasts her: you got it. Elizabeth studies her
bottle... gives Jack a sidelong glance. Back to her bottle
...

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (under her breath)
          Drink up me hearties, yo ho...

                    JACK
          What? What was that?
              (Elizabeth smiles)
          Something funny, Miss Swann? share.
          Please,

                    ELIZABETH
          Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ...
          I'm reminded of a song I learned
          as a child. A song about pirates.

                    JACK
          I know a lot of songs about pirates,
          but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear
          it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Oh, no ... it's silly.   Back in
          England we didn't know   a thing
          about pirates, really.   They seemed
          so romantic and daring   -

Jack likes the way that sounds.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
              (looks at him)
          That was before I met one, of
          course.

                    JACK

          Now I must hear this song. An
          authentic pirate song. Have at it.

                    ELIZABETH
          Well, perhaps ... with a bit more
          to drink, I might ...

                    JACK
          More to drink!

He gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. She drops
her half-finished bottle to catch it. Opens it, takes a
sip.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Well?

Elizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self-
consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on.

                    ELIZABETH
          We pillage, we plunder, we rifle,
          we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo
          ho.

She gestures for him to drink. He does.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          We kidnap and ravage and we don't
          give a hoot, Drink up me hearties,
          yo ho -

EXT. ISLET - BEACH - LATER - NIGHT

The middle of the night. A fire BLAZES. Jack and Elizabeth
are roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the way
up to the stars --

                    JACK/ELIZABETH
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for
          me!

Yo ho, yo ho, it's a pirates life for me!

                    JACK
          I LOVE this song!
              (sings)
          Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for
          me! We're beggars and blighters,

          ne'er do well cads, Drink up me
          hearties, yo ho!
              (gives it a touch of
               Irish ballad)
          Aye but we're loved by our mums and our
          dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!

They hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks. He drains
the bottle, then tosses it away.

                    JACK   (CONT'D)
          When I get the   Black Pearl back, I'm
          going to teach   it to the whole crew,
          and we'll sing   it all the time!

                    ELIZABETH
          You'll be positively the most fearsome
          pirates to sail the Spanish Main.

Elizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle. Jack doesn't
have a bottle to salute back. She hands him hers. He
drinks, then settles shakily to the ground. Elizabeth sits
beside him.

                    JACK
          Not just the Spanish Main. The whole
          ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we
          want to go, we go. That's what a ship
          is, you know. Not just a keel and a
          hull and a deck and sails. That's what
          a ship need_ ... but what a ship is --
          what the Black Pearl really-is ... is
          freedom.

Elizabeth lays her head on his shoulder.

                    ELIZABETH
          Jack, it must be so terrible for you,
          to be trapped here on this island, all
          over again.

                    JACK
          Ah, well... the company is better
          than last time. And the scenery
          has definitely improved.

                      ELIZABETH
              (coy)

          Mr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had
          enough rum to allow that kind of talk.

                    JACK
          We've got a few bottles left ...
          and we've yet to tap the kegs.

Elizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile.
She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up.

                    ELIZABETH
          To freedom.

                    JACK
          To the Black Pearl.

They tap the bottles together. Elizabeth feigns a drink as
he chugs. He taps his bottle against her again. She laughs,
feigns another drink -

EXT. ISLET - BEACH - MORNING

CLOSE ON -- JACK'S FACE, dead asleep, lying in the
sunlight. His nose twitches. A bit of SMOKE drifts by. His
nose twitches again. His eyes open.

Jack GROANS and sits up. He rubs his head, looks over -

-- all of the foliage in the middle of the island is ON
FIRE. Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky.

Jack leaps to his feet. He sees Elizabeth, as she pours out
the last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a
palm tree. It goes up in FLAMES. She rolls the barrel
forward -- it starts to BURN merrily.

Jack can't believe his eyes.

                    JACK
          What are you doing? You've burned
          our food, the shade -- the rum!

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, the rum is gone.

She wipes her hands together. One of the rum barrels in the
fire EXPLODES.

                    JACK

          Why?

                    ELIZABETH
          One, because it is a vile drink that
          turns even the most respectable men
          into scoundrels. Two -

She points to the sky.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          That signal is over a thousand feet
          high, which means it can be seen for
          two hundred leagues in every direction.
          The entire Royal Navy is out to sea
          looking for me -- do you think there is
          even a chance they could mass it?

                    JACK
          You -- you burned up the island, for a
          one-time chance at being spotted?

                     ELIZABETH
          Exactly.

Elizabeth turns toward the sea.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          Just you wait, Captain. In an hour,
          maybe two, keep a 'weather eye open'
          and you'll be seeing white sails on
          that horizon!

She sits down, determined. Shields her eyes, scans the
water, waiting, searching. Jack is speechless. He throws up
his hands, stalks up the sand dune, just to get away from
her.

EXT. ISLET - LEEWARD SHORE - DAY

At the crest of the dune, Jack stops -- and stares,
incredulous. We come around to see what he is looking at -

Past Jack, anchored the other side of the island, white
sails glorious against the turquoise waters, is the H.M.S.
Dauntless. A longboat is already being rowed toward them.

Jack shakes his head.

                     JACK

          They'll be no living with her
          after this.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - DAY

Norrington gives Elizabeth a hand disembarking from the
raised long boat.

                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth, I'm" relieved you're
          safe.
              (re: Jack)
          Clap him in irons. And behind his
          back this time.

                    ELIZABETII
          Commodore, you can't do that!

                    NORRINGTON
          You're speaking up for him again?

                    ELIZABETH
          He can locate Isla de Muerta --
          but I doubt he'll be willing to
          help us from the brig.

                    JACK
              (she's right)
          We had time to get to know each other.

                    NORRINGTON
          We are bound for Port Royal, not
          Isla de Muerta.

                    ELIZABETH
          No. The pirates have taken Will -

                    NORRINGTON
          Your father is frantic with worry.
          Our mission was to rescue you and
          return home. That is what we shall
          do. Mr. Turner's fate is
          regrettable. But so was his
          decision to engage in piracy.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, please!

                    JACK

          Norrington, think about it ... the
          Black Pearl, its captain and
          crew... the last pirate threat in
          the Caribbean. How can you pass
          that up?

                    NORRINGTON
          By remembering that I serve
          others, not only myself.

                    ELIZABETH
          Commodore, I beg you -- please do
          this ... for me. As a wedding
          gift.

                    NORRINGTON
          I am to understand that you will
          accept my marriage proposal on the
          condition I rescue Mr. Turner?

                    ELIZABETH
          Not as a condition -- a request.

Norrington considers. To Gillette:

                    NORRINGTON
          Free Mister Sparrow, and prepare to
          come about. He'll give you our heading.

Gillette unlocks Jack's manacles. Jack raises an eyebrow.

                    JACK
          Congratulations, sir.

Crew men lead Jack toward the bridge. Sailors go about
their tasks, and the ship begins its slow turn.

                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth, I hereby withdraw my
          proposal.

                    ELIZABETH
          What?

                    NORRINGTON
          I know now where your heart truly
          lies.

Elizabeth looks at Norrington, seeing him in a new light.

                    ELIZABETH
          And now I know... where yours
          does, as well.

They gaze at each other for a moment. Norrington looks
away.

                    NORRINGTON
          You may seclude yourself in my
          cabin. I'm afraid we do not have
          any ladies' clothing aboard.

                    ELIZABETH
          Then I can wear men's clothing.

                    NORRINGTON
          That would hardly be proper.

                    ELIZABETH
          Well, I am not going to stay
          hidden in a some cabin, 80 I
          suppose it's going to be heaving
          bosoms and bare ankles for the
          remainder of the voyage!

Norrington is exasperated, but then can't help but grin -
this is exactly why he loves her. She grins back at him -
she's not going to change.

                    NORRINGTON
          Murtogg, take our guest below, and find
          her some trousers, and a shirt.

Elizabeth smiles, allows herself to be escorted away.
Norrington watches her go ... then turns his gaze to the
sea.

INT. THE BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY

Pintel enters the cell. It appears empty -- but that's
because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove
up the ceiling planks with his legs.

                    PINTEL
          That ain't going to work. That's the
          gun deck above yea

Will drops lightly to the deck. Suddenly:

                    WILL
          What happened to William Turner?

                    PINTEL
          Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He
          threw in with us after we relieved Jack
          Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned
          out, it never sat well with him-
          particularly after we found Cortes'
          treasure, and its peculiar condition.
          He thought we deserved to be cursed,
          for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we
          did. That's why he sent off a piece of
          the treasure -- to you, as it were: so
          it would never be recovered, and so
          cursed we_ remain.

                    WILL
          And then he ran. And he's hiding out
          someplace where you haven't been able
          to find him.

                    PINTEL
          That's a nice thought, to be sure, and
          I wager your da wishes he'd thought it
          hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done,
          _ didn't sit too well with Captain
          Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to
          his legs and dumped him over.

Will reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate.

                    PINTEL (CONT'D)
          Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill,
          was his face looking up, as he
          sank down to the crushing black
          oblivion of Davy Jones' locker.
              (sighs)
          It was only after, we found out we
          needed his blood to solve the curse.
          That's what you call ironic.

Barbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several other
pirates. He regards Will for a moment, then:

                       BARBOSSA
          Bring him.

EXT. H. M.. S.. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - EVENING

Jack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at
the sea. Elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to
excellent effect, joins him.

                    ELIZABETH
          You didn't tell Commodore Norrington
          everything.

                    JACK
          Nor did you, I noticed.

                    ELIZABETH
          He might delay the rescue ... and
          that would be too late.

                     JACK
          Exactly.

                    ELIZABETH
          These men will be facing an enemy
          that seemingly cannot be killed.

                     JACK
          I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any
          battle will be decidedly brief ... and
          one-sided.

                    ELIZABETH
          What's your plan?

                     LOOKOUT (O.S.)
          LAND HO!

Isla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon.

                    NORRINGTON
          Elizabeth -- below decks. I will
          not compromise your safety..

She starts to speak; he turns away..

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my
          quarters, and make sure she stays
          there.

Norrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island. Jack
watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          I don't like the situation, mister
          Sparrow. The island is riddled
          with caves. I will not put my men
          at a disadvantage.

                    JACK
          Funny, I was thinking   along those lines.
          How about you let me   go in alone, and
          while you're setting   up an ambush, I'll
          trick the pirates out   to you.

                    NORRINGTON
          You would do that?

                    JACK
          They left me stranded. Twice. What
          have you got to lose?

                    NORRINGTON
              (looks at him)
          Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid
          of.

                    JACK
              (smiles)
          I knew you'd listen to reason!

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING

Torches are lit. Barbossa leads Will, guarded by Pintel and
a band of pirates, into the caves.

EXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

A long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side. Jack
wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch.

                    JACK
          That chart I drew up'11 get you
          past the reefs. If you're
          steersman's good enough, that is.

                    NORRINGTON
          I'll be at the wheel myself.

                    JACK
          I'll slip in, talk them into to come
          out, and you'll be free to blow holy
          high heaven the whole lot of them.

The crewmen release the lines, and the boat drops -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

The pirate group moves deeper into the caves. Will moves
along unwillingly.

                    PINTEL
          No reason to fret. It's just a prick of
          the finger and a few drops of blood.

                     BARBOSSA
          Turner blood doesn't flow pure in
          his veins.
              (grins)
          Best play it safe, and spill it all.

                    PINTEL
          I guess there is a reason to fret.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT

The Dauntless drifts into the lagoon. Norrington and his
men prepare to go ashore.     h

INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

Lit by torchlight. Will notices: a crack runs between the
floor and the wall of the cave, widening into a ravine.

                    BARBOSSA
          Careful, now. You could fall in and
          still be wonder'n when you'll hit dirt.

Will makes a decision. He intentionally stumbles. Pintel

shoves him forward -- Will continues forward, grabs the
pirate in front of him, swings him into the wall of the
cave. Catches the pirate's torch, and uses it to ward off
the others.

                    WILL
          You deserve to be cursed -- and
          remain cursed!

He steps to one side -- and drops into the ravine. The wall
of the ravine becomes a loose gravel slope; Will hits it,
and tumbles down, disappears into black.

                    BARBOSSA
          Blast him! A pox on him, and his
          father, and the whole damnable
          line! Fan out! Find him!

INT. DAUNTLESS - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

Elizabeth looks out the Captain's small porthole -- sees
boats laden with Navy men headed for shore.

She turns away from the porthole, wishing there was
something she could do. Suddenly there is a flutter at the
window--

Cotton's parrot is there.

                    COTTON'S PARROT
          Drink UP me hearties yo ho! Drink UP me
          hearties yo ho!

The bird flutters off; Elizabeth races to the porthole, and
then to the stern window to see it flyaway.

She looks down -- and there, fastened to the stern of the
ship, is a small rowboat.

INT. ISLA DEMUERTA - CAVES - NIGHT

Will races forward, turning this way and that. He sees a
light ahead, heads for it, turns a corner -

-- and runs straight into Jack.

                    JACK
          Do you have any idea where you're
          going?

                    WILL
          Jack!

                    JACK
          Don't talk. These caves magnify
          sound. Just follow me.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA -       THE BEACH - NIGHT

Norrington and men land on the beach, and spread out. They
silently take up positions around the main cave entrance.

INT. CAVES - NIGHT

Jack leads Will out of a narrow passage -- and stops,
staring. Will is a few steps behind.

                    WILL
          Are you certain this is the right way?

                    JACK
          It's the right way.

Will join him -- and see what Jack is staring at:

Treasure piled on treasure, sparkling, glowing, seemingly

endless. At the center is the moonlit clearing, and the
stone Aztec chest.

                    BARBOSSA
          Thank you, Jack Sparrow.

The jump -- Barbossa is standing right behind them, flanked
by his men. The trio whirl to run - - more pirates emerge
from hiding. Nearly the entire crew of the Black Pearl is
there.

The pirates grab Will and Jack. Will struggles, but Jack
does not fight at all.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          You couldn't have led him back
          more directly if you knew exactly
          where you were going.

He laughs, and moves toward the stone chest. The pirates
follow, dragging Will and Jack with them.

                     WILL
          You did know where you were going!
          You did lead us directly to them!
               (Jack's silence confirms it)
          Why?

Jack looks away -- as Will is manhandled toward the chest.
Barbo8sa steps up to him (becoming skeletal in the
moonlight) and puts the medallion around Will's neck.

He picks up the stone knife.

                    BARBOSSA
          What was begun by blood, let blood now
          end!

He raises the knife to Will's throat -

                    JACK
          You don't want to be doing that.

Barbossa pretends to think about his words.

                    BARBOSSA
          No, I really think I do.

                    JACK
              (shrugs)
          All right then.

That makes Barbossa pause. He steps out of the moonlight.

                    BARBOSSA
          Why don't I want to do this?

                    JACK
          Because, right about now, the H.M.S.
          Dauntless is lying in wait in the
          harbor.

                    WILL
          Jack!

                    JACK
          - - and its guns and crew will cut you
          and your men to pieces the moment you
          step outside these caves.

A buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates.

                    PINTEL
          Do you believe him?

                    BARBOSSA
          No.
              (indicates Will)
          But him I believe. He is genuinely
          angry.

                    JACK
          You've no hope of surviving
          Norrington's attack ... that is, if
          you're mortal.

                    BARBOSSA
          What're you suggesting?

Jack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward
Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins.

                    JACK
          Simple. Don't kill the boy yet.
          Wait for a more opportune moment.

Will glares, listening to every word he says. Jack scoops
up a handful of coins from the chest.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
              (drops the coins one-by-
               one back into the chest)
          Like after you've killed... Every...
          Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.

                    BARBOSSA
          I can't help wondering, Jack, why
          you're being so helpful and all? Last
          time you did that, it didn't end 80
          well for you.

                    JACK
          The situation has changed.

                     BARBOSSA
          That so?

                    JACK
          Aye. See, after you're done with the
          Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a
          problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There
          you'll be, with two lovely ships on
          your hands, and what to do? Of course
          you'll decide you deserve the bigger
          one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless
          a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it,
          you can rule the seas.
              (beat)

          But if you're Captain of the Dauntless,
          who's left for the Black Pearl?

Jack smiles and spreads his hands: me.

                     JACK (CONT'D)
          I sail for you as part of your fleet, I
          give you fifteen percent of my plunder,
          and you get to introduce yourself at
          tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore
          Barbossa.'
              (sticks out his hand)
          Do we have an accord?

Barbossa licks his lips. It's tempting ...

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Now, you can take care of the
          Dauntless, right?

                    BARBOSSA
          Men! Are you up for it?

The pirates yell to the affirmative.

                    BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Mr. Pintel, select five men to
          stay here. Take the rest of the
          men out ... not through the caves.

Jack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for.

                    JACK
          There's ... another exit?

                    BARBOSSA
          Aye, for us there is.

EXT. LAGOON - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

Moonlight shines down into the shallow waters, brightening
coral, sparkling over the rippled sand floor.

Suddenly all the fish SCATTER. Briefly, the waters are
empty.

And then FIGURES appear in the distance, seeming to waver
in the shifting current. They scuffle forward, kicking up
clouds of sand --

The figures resolve into the skeleton PIRATES, moving
silently across the lagoon floor, swords glinting. The
tatters of their clothing drift in the water. Their skull
heads are fixed in an endless grin.

The LEAD PIRATE glides forward -

And stops next to a huge iron ANCHOR -- twice his' height,
even buried halfway into the sand. A heavy CHAIN with
barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface -

A SHADOW falls across the Lead Pirate -- he TRANSFORMS, and
we see that it is Pintel. He looks up -

Above, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of
the H.M.S. Dauntless, silhouetted by moonlight.

The huge shift drifts, again spilling moonlight below -

And the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again
SKELETONS, staring with upturned faces. The Pintel-skeleton
puts a knife between his teeth, starts to crawl up the iron
rings.

Other pirates crowd forward, and soon the anchor-chain is
clustered with skeletons -

EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT

Elizabeth has the small boat out, and rows away from the
Dauntless, looking ahead over her shoulder. Cotton's parrot
is nowhere to be seen.

In the distance, Pintel breaks the surface near the
Dauntless, intent on climbing the anchor; he looks over -

Just as Elizabeth rounds the point, and rocks obscure the
small longboat from view.

More skeleton-pirates appear, and Pintel continues his
climb.

EXT. LAGOON - DAUNTLESS - NIGHT

Two SAILORS, alert and vigilant, stare out toward shore.
The island reveals nothing but blackness.

There is a scurrying sound -- bones scraping against wood -
and the sailors JUMP. They listen, intently -- nothing.

                    TALL SAILOR
          Ship rats. Big ones.

                    SHORT SAILOR
              (nods)
          Hate those things.

They turn back toward the island, continue their vigil. A
long pause.

                    SHORT SAILOR (CONT'D)
          Taste all right, though.

                    TALL SAILOR
          That they do.

From behind, the two sailors at the rail are well-lit by a
lantern. Suddenly shadows appear, skeletons, climbing up
the sailor's backs. -MOVE CLOSER and then the skeletons
appear, reaching -- the two sailors are grabbed from behind
-

EXT. DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT

Two bodies are tossed out over the rail, hit the water with
a splash.

EXT. DAUNTLESS - SIDE - NIGHT

Pintel looks down into the water, satisfied. Puts away his
knife. Notices, pulls out a long piece of seaweed from his
rib cage. Tosses it. Turns to the others.

                    PINTEL
          Be quick, now. Train the starboard guns
          on the beach, and set your aim. Wait
          for my signal, we don't want to spook
          them.

The pirates hurry to comply -

EXT. LAGOON - BLACK PEARL - NIGHT

Elizabeth rounds the point further, and sees: the Black
Pearl, anchored in the neighboring cove. A fleck of color -
Cotton's parrot, as it darts in through a porthole.

Elizabeth slows her efforts, silently approaching the ship.

EXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - NIGHT

Four PIRATES -- who really ought to be keeping watch -

instead have gathered wine bottles and rum casts into a
pile, along apples, biscuits -- all the food on the ship.

They act out a mock-feast, in anticipation of the curse
being lifted. A SKINNY skeleton offers two bottles BIG
BONED

skeleton.

                      SKINNY
            Which would you prefer first, good
            sir -rum, or wine?

                      BIG-BONES
            I believe I'll have a spot o' rum, if
            you don't mind, and thank'ee kind sir!

They burst out laughing -- a hideous sound that wheezes
through their bones.

Behind them, unnoticed, Elizabeth peeks cautiously around a
corner. She picks her moment and sneaks past quickly, down
a gangway, disappearing into the blackness of the ship.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Gillette crouches, running low behind a line of rocks. He
reports to Norrington:

                      GILLETTE
            All the men in place, sir. Ready to
            fire.

                      NORRINGTON
            Wait for my order -- what the blazes is
            that?

It's the sound of cannon fire -- coming from the Dauntless.
Cannonballs hit the shore; men cry out in anguish.

                      NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
            Men! Take cover!

The sailors scramble to find refuge -

INT. ISLA DE MUERTA - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

Will, guarded by pirates, glares at Jack.

                    WILL
          You've been planning this from the
          beginning. Since you learned my name.

Jack takes the opportunity to move toward him.

                    JACK
          Oh, please -- do I really seem that
          clever?

Before Will can answer, Jack smoothly slips the sword from
a Pirate's scabbard -- tosses it to Will, who catches it
despite his surprise.

                    JACK (CONT'D)
          Use it well.

He draws his own sword -- and clobbers the Pirate. Barbossa
and the other pirates stare in shock -

                    BARBOSSA
          Confound it, Jack -- I was
          actually beginning to like you!

Swords are drawn, and the Pirates attack.

Jack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own
style: Will parries, glissades and disarms with lightning
fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists,
acrobatics and anything within reach to survive.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

The sailors charge. The moon emerges from behind a cloud -

Suddenly army of SKELETON PIRATES rise up from the sea, and
charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down -

                    NORRINGTON
          Steady, men! Remember -- we're the
          Navy!

The sailors recover their nerve, and engage the enemy. It's
a full on battle, Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates -

The Navy men are driven back, surrounded -

Suddenly there is a massive BOOM of cannon fire.
Norrington, in the midst of a swordfight, tries to see -

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          What is happening out there?

EXT. LAGOON - NIGHT

It's the Black Pearl, manned by Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton,
and captained by Elizabeth, coming around the point,
cannons blazing.

EXT. H.M. S. DAUNTLESS - NIGHT

The pirates on the ship are caught by surprise, try to turn
their cannons to this new foe -

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Gillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless.

                    GILLETTE
          They're on our side! Take heart, men!

The Royal Navy stand their ground and fight -

INT. CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - NIGHT

Only two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby. Jacoby rounds
on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack.

                    BARBOSSA
          Just so you know, Jack -- I don't
          think you're that clever. I think
          you're a fool. A mortal fool.

                    JACK
          Remarkable how often those two
          traits coincide.

Jack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh.

                    BARBOSSA
          You can't beat me, Jack.

To prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches
Jack's sword with both hands. Jack can't free it. Barbossa
twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it -

- - AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACK'S CHEST.

Will battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the
jaw, crumpling him

                    WILL
          Jack!

Jack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He
takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when
he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOME SKELETAL.

                    JACK
          Well, isn't that interesting.

Skeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls
something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins.

                    JACK (CONT' D)
          They're so pretty, I just couldn't
          resist stealing one. It's a curse,
          I guess.

Barbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are
in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle.

                    BARBOSSA
          So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we
          to be two immortals, locked in
          epic battle until the trumpets of
          Judgment Day?

                    JACK
          Or you could surrender.

He shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa
stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack.

                    BARBOSSA
          Or I could chain you to a
          cannonball and drop you in the
          deepest part of the ocean, where
          you can contemplate your folly
          forever.

Barbossa charges -

A SHOT RINGS OUT -

Jack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again,
holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa.

                     BARBOSSA (CONT'D)
          Hah. Ten years you carried that
          pistol, and you end up wasting
          your shot.

                    WILL
          He didn't waste it.

Will stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword,
his left hand in a fist. He opens the fist -

-- the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand,
revealing the cut in his palm.

Barbossa stares, then looks down at his chest. Blood
blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreads
quickly.

Barbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for
the first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to the
ground, dead.

Jack blows the smoke from the barrel of his pistol...
tosses it away.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT

Murtogg FIRES a pistol at a pirate. The pirate is hit,
screams in pain, and crumples to the ground. Mullroy runs
through another with his sword.

The pirates react to the sight, and quickly realize their
peril. They set their weapons down in surrender.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHT

The Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless, and Jack's
crew swarm across, overwhelming the pirates.

The sailors on the beach see it, and CHEER.

INT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT

Will wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near the
chest.

                    WILL
          Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever
          heard of.
              (smiles)
          You're a man who can be trusted, who
          can be counted on, and who can It
          betray his friends. What kind of pirate
          is that?

                     JACK
              (admits it)
          The worst.
              (beat)
          On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who
          can't pass up a chance for revenge
          against the black-hearted bastard who
          stole my ship and left me to die in the
          middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and
          who knows how to get what he wants. Now
          that's a great pirate.

Jack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest
... and then hesitates.

Will looks at him...

Jack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside the
other bloody coin.

Suddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT.
Elizabeth stares at it.

                    WILL
          Let's get out of here.

EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT - LATER

Jack, Will, and Norrington gather together on the beach.
Elizabeth calls out:

                    ELIZABETH
          You're all right!

The three men turn as one. An awkward moment -- which of
them does she mean?

Elizabeth races across the sand, toward them -- and
straight to Will. She throws her arms around his neck in a
hug.

                    WILL
          Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers?
          And how did you get off the island?

Elizabeth can't believe that's what he noticed. Indignant,
she steps away from him.

                    ELIZABETH
          Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for
          how we got off the island -- ah, that's
          a grand adventure, but now is not the
          time to talk about it.

She reaches a hand behind his neck, decisively kisses him.

                    ELIZABETH (CONT'D)
          There. And don't you dare tell me
          that wasn't a proper kiss!

                    WILL
          Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter-
          that we are of a different class -

                    ELIZABETH
          It doesn't!

                    WILL
          -- but that was not a proper kiss.

Pure consternation on Elizabeth's face -

                    WILL (CONT'D)
          This is a proper kiss.

Will sweeps her in his arms, leans her back, and kisses her
long and well -

Jack puts a hand on Norrington's shoulder.

                    JACK
          Tough luck. I was rooting for you.

EXT. PORT ROYAL - FORT CHARLES - DAY

Close on: Will's face, stoic, staring forward. He stands
straight and unmoving. Around him are members of the Royal
Navy, standing before for a group of witnesses from town.

It is the courtyard on the top of Fort Charles. A trial is
underway -- with Will as the defendant.

                      NORRINGTON
          ...and though I do say so with
          regret, the law is clear. The
          penalty for piracy is death by
          hanging.

In the crowd, Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father,
Swann. She lets go as Swann stands.

                    SWANN
          By your leave, I wish to speak on
          behalf of the boy.
              (a glance at Elizabeth)
          It is clear that these deeds were
          performed out of a sincere desire   to do
          good, at great personal risk. It   seems
          to me, that in the rare occasion   where
          the right course is committing an   act
          of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the
          right course!
              (cheers of approval)
          So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend
          to grant a pardon to --

                    GILLETTE
          Sir!

All eyes turn. Gillette stands at the top of a stairway.

                    GILLETTE (CONT'D)
          Jack and his crew have escaped!
              (gasps from the crowd)
          There was no damage to the cell ...
          they must have been set free.

Will and Elizabeth exchange looks. You? Not me, you? No,
not me either! Swann notices something the parapet, points
-

                    SWANN
          The Black Pearl!

People rush to the parapet. Sure enough, below in the bay
are the distinctive black sails of the Pearl. The ship cuts
through the waters very close to the point -

-- where the gallows of the pirates are. Suddenly Jack
appears, on the point; he swings off the one empty
gallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as it
passes.

                    GILLETTE
          Sir! Shall I break out the
          cannons?

                    NORRINGTON
          I don't think that will be necessary.

Norrington raises his hand ... twirls a key on his finger.

                    NORRINGTON (CONT'D)
          A day's head start. That's all he gets.

Will, Elizabeth and Swann look out toward ocean-

EXT. BLACK PEARL - STERN DECK - DAY

Jack monkeys down the rigging. AnaMaria is at the wheel.

                    ANAMARIA
          Captain Sparrow -- the Black Pearl
          is yours!

Jack runs a hand lovingly along the rail, then takes the
wheel. It feels good -- right -- in his hands. He enjoys
it, and then shifts to 'Captain' mode.

                    JACK
          AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!

                    ANAMARIA
          Aye, aye, sir!

                    JACK
          Mr. Gibbs, organize a cleaning detail -
          you and Cotton. I want every inch of
          the Pearl spic-and-span and ship-shape!

Gibbs actually stomps the deck, executes a salute.

Jack stands at the wheel: he's got his ship back, and all
is right with the world. He begins to unconsciously hum:
"Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me ..."

He realizes what he's doing and smiles, the orchestra takes
over as the Black Pearl sails for uncharted waters ... and
we FADE UP large words in script:

                    THE END

                         I think it's bad luck for the groom 
                         to see the bride before the wedding.

                         Governor Weatherby Swann, it's been 
                         too long.

                         In fact, I *do*. Mister Mercer! The 
                         warrant for the arrest of one William

                         Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake. 
                         Arrest her.

                         And I have another one for a Mister 
                         James Norrington. Is he present?

                         I don't believe that's the answer to 
                         the question I asked.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Lord Beckett! In the category of questions 
                         *not* answered...

                         We are under the jurisdiction of the 
                         King's governor of Port Royal, and you 
                         will tell us what we are charged with.

                         For which the punishment, regrettably, 
                         is *also* death. Perhaps you remember 
                         a certain pirate named Jack Sparrow.
 
                         
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN

                         Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, I thought 
                         you might.

                         as well, were expecting something a 
                         bit more... *shiny*. What with the Isla

                         by the sea, and the treasure with it.

                         Perhaps dear old Jack is not serving

                         Do not blame the bird. Show us what 
                         is on that piece of cloth there.

                         It does me.

                         It's a key!

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         No! Much more better. It is a *drawing* 
                         of a key. 
 
               [Jack holds up the cloth, the crew crowd forward]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Gentlemen, what do keys do?

                         Keys... unlock... *things*? 

                                     GIBBS
                         And whatever this key unlocks, *inside* 
                         there's something valuable. So, we're 
                         setting out to find whatever this key 
                         unlocks!
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         No! If we don't have the key, we can't 
                         open whatever it is we don't have that 
                         it unlocks. So what purpose would be 
                         served in finding whatever need be unlocked, 
                         which we don't have, without first having 
                         found the key what unlocks it?
 
                                     GIBBS
                         So - We're going after this key!

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You're not making any sense at all. 
                         Any more questions?

                         So... Do we have a heading?

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Hah! A heading. Set sail in a... mmm... 
                          a general... in *that* way - direction.

                         Come on, snap to and make sail, you 
                         know how this works. Come on, ?oy/?quick, 
                         ?oy/?quick, hey!

                         seems to be actin' a bit strange...

                         Mark my words, what bodes ill for Jack

                         The East India Trading Company has need 
                         of your services.  We wish for you to 
                         act as our agent in a business transaction 
                         with our mutual friend: Captain Sparrow.
 
                         
                                     WILL TURNER
                         More acquaintance than friend. How do 
                         you know him?
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         We've had dealings in the past.  And 
                         we've each left our mark... on the other. 
                         
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         What mark did he leave on you? 

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         By your efforts Jack Sparrow was set 
                         free. I would like you to go to him, 
                         and recover a certain property in his 
                         possession.

                         Recover. At the point of a sword?

                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         *Bargain*!

               [Beckett goes over to a wooden box on a table and opens it]
 
               
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         Letters of Marque. You will offer what 
                         amounts to a full pardon. Jack will 
                         be free, a privateer in the employ of 
                         England.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Somehow I doubt Jack will consider employment 
                         the same as being free.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                          Freedom.  Jack Sparrow is a dying breed. 
                          The world is shrinking, the blank pages 
                         of the map filled in. Jack must find 
                         his place in the new world or perish. 
                         Not unlike you, Mister Turner. You and 
                         your fiancée face the hangman's noose.

                         So you get both Jack *and* the Black 
                         Pearl.
 
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         The Black Pearl?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         The property you want that he possesses.
 
                         
                                     LORD CUTLER BECKETT
                         A ship? Hardly. The item in question's 
                         considerably smaller and far more valuable. 
                         Something Sparrow keeps on his person 
                         at all times. A compass.  Ah, you know 
                         it. Bring back that Compass, or there's 
                         no deal.

                         I'm afraid that *currency* is the currency 
                         of the realm.

                         only to the Isla de Muerta, and so you 
                         hope to *save* me from an evil fate. 
                         But you mustn't worry. I care not for 
                         cursed Aztec gold. My desires are not 
                         so provincial. There's more than one 
                         chest of value in these waters. So perhaps 
                         you may wish to enhance your offer.

                         fate intervenes. You make great efforts 
                         to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

                         Oh really. To ensure Mister Turner's 
                         freedom, then? I'll still want that 
                         Compass. Consider that in your calculations.

                         Aye, the Pelegostos made Jack their 
                         chief. But he only remains chief as

                         form, and they intend to do him the 
                         honor of releasing him from his fleshy

               into the water]

               out of it onto the deck]
 
               [Will battles the invading crewmembers, but one of them knocks 
               Will unconscious]

                         dark abyss? All your deeds laid bare. 
                         All your sins punished.  I can offer 
                         you... an escape-uh.

               [Jones walks over to the chaplain, takes the chaplain's head 
               in his claw]

                         Life is cruel.  Why should the afterlife 
                         be any *different*? I offer you a choice.

               people]

                          *You* are neither dead nor dying. What 
                         is your purpose here?

                          Jack Sparrow sent me to settle his 
                         debt.

                          What is your purpose here?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         Jack Sparrow. He sent me to settle his 
                         debt.
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         Huh! Did he, now? I'm sorely tempted 
                         to accept that offer.

               him]

               [suddenly Jones is standing aboard the Black Pearl, directly 
               in front of Jack and his spyglass]

               Dutchman crewmembers who teleported over]

                         Oh.

                                     DAVY JONES
                         You have a debt to pay. You've been 
                         captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen 
                         years. *That* was our agreement.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Technically, I was only captain for 
                         two years, then I was viciously mutinied 
                         upon.
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         Then you were a poor captain, but a 
                         *captain* nonetheless! Have you not 
                         introduced yourself all these years 
                         as *Captain* Jack Sparrow? 
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You have my payment. One soul to serve 
                         on your ship is already over there.
 
                         
                                     DAVY JONES
                         One soul is not equal to another.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Aha! So we've established my proposal 
                         is sound in principle, now we're just 
                         haggling over price. 
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         Price? Pttt!

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Just how many souls do you think my 
                         soul is worth?
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         One hundred souls, three days-uh.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You're a diamond, mate. Send me back 
                         the boy, I'll get started right off. 
                         
 
               [Maccus blocks Jack from exiting]

                         I keep the boy. A good-faith payment. 
                         That leaves you only ninety-nine more 
                         to go. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha! 
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Have you not met Will Turner? He's noble, 
                         heroic, *terrific* soprano. Worth at 
                         least four... maybe three and a half. 
                         And did I happen to mention... he's 
                         in love. With a girl. Due to be married. 
                         Betrothed.  Dividing him from her and 
                         her from him... would only be half as 
                         cruel as actually allowing them be joined 
                         in holy matrimony. Aye?
 
                                     DAVY JONES
                         I keep the boy. Ninety-nine souls-uh. 
                         But I wonder, Sparrow, can you live 
                         with this? Can you condemn an innocent 
                         man - a friend-uh - to a lifetime of 
                         servitude, in your name while you roam 
                         free?
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                          Yep! I'm good with it. Should we seal 
                         it in blood? I mean... mm-mm - ink?
 
                         
               [Jones grabs Jack's hand, resulting in a squishy sound]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Uh!

                                     DAVY JONES
                         Three days.  Three days.

               [Pintel whimpers, with a knife held to his neck from a crewmember 
               of Jones' ship]
 
               [Jack looks at his hand, it's covered with slime, but the black 
               spot disappears under the effect of the slime]
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oh, Mr. Gibbs.

                                     GIBBS
                         Aye.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Uh, I feel sullied and unusual. 

                                     GIBBS
                         And how do you intend to harvest these 
                         ninety-nine souls in three days?
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Fortunately, he was mum as the condition 
                         in which these souls need be.
 
                                     GIBBS
                         Ah... Tortuga!

                         us, pilotage. Are we all to work for

                         free port left in these waters.

                         I'm sorry. An honest sailor is what 
                         I am. I make my living fair, and I sleep

                         S-Seaweed can be a sign.

                         I chased a man across the Seven Seas.

                         or there'll be no captain. And if there's 
                         no captain, there's no one to have the

                         You know, these clothes do not flatter 
                         you at all. It should be a dress or 
                         nothing. I happen to have no dress in 
                         my cabin.

                         to tell you this but... through an unfortunate 
                         and *entirely* unforeseeable series 
                         of circumstances that have nothing whatsoever 
                         to do with me, poor William has been 
                         press-ganged into Davy Jones' crew.

                         Oh, please. The captain of the Flying 
                         Dutchman.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                          You look bloody awful. What are you 
                         doing here?
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         You *hired* me. I can't help it if your 
                         standards are lax.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You *smell* funny.

                         Jack. All I want is to find Will.

                         Are you certain? Is that what you really 
                         want most?

                         find a way to *save* Will the most.

                         Well, there is a chest...

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Oh, dear.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         A chest of unknown size and origin.

                         And whoever possesses that chest possesses 
                         the leverage to command Jones to do 
                         whatever it is he or she wants, including... 
                         saving brave William from his grim fate.

                         True enough. This Compass does not point 
                         north.

                         most in this world is to find the chest 
                         of Davy Jones, is it not?

                         a way to sever Jones' hold on you. And 
                         not rest until this blade pierces his

                         to look like that while thinking about 
                         me.

                         It was found aboard the ship. The crew 
                         it thought it was a spirit bringing 
                         some omen of ill fate.

                         to do because you want it. To act on 
                         selfish impulse. You want to see what 
                         it's like. One day, you won't be able 
                         to resist.

                         You'll have the chance to do something... 
                         something courageous. And when you do, 
                         you'll discover something: that you're

               them] 
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Will! You're alright! Thank God! I came 
                         to find you!
 
               [Will and Elizabeth kiss]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         How did you get here?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         Sea turtles, mate. A pair of them, strapped 
                         to my feet.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Not so easy, is it?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         But I do owe you thanks, Jack.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         You do?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         After you tricked me onto that ship 
                         to square your debt with Jones.
 
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         What?

                                     JACK SPARROW
                          What?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         I was reunited with my father.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oh! Well... you're welcome, then.

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                          Everything you said to me... every 
                         word, was a lie!
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Pretty much. Time and tide, love.  
 
                         
               [Will stoops down with the key to open the chest]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oy! What're you doing?

                                     WILL TURNER
                         I'm gonna kill Jones.

               [Jack draws his sword, points it at Will]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Can't let you do that, William. 'Cause 
                         if Jones is dead, who's to call his 
                         terrible beastie off the hunt, eh? Now. 
                         If you please: The key.
 
               [Will backs up slowly, then suddenly draws Elizabeth's sword, 
               points it at Jack]
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         I keep the promises I make, Jack. I 
                         intend to free my father. I hope you're 
                         here to see it.
 
               [Norrington draws his sword, points it at Will]

                                     NORRINGTON
                         I can't let you do that, either. So 
                         sorry.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                          I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.
 
                         
               [Norrington points his sword at Jack]

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Lord Beckett desires the contents of 
                         that chest. I deliver it, and get my 
                         life back.
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Ah. The dark side of ambition.

                                     NORRINGTON
                         Oh, I prefer to see it as the promise 
                         of redemption.
 
               

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Stop it!

               Be careful!

               [various dueling interjections]

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Jack!

                                     WILL TURNER
                         Guard the chest!

               [duel halts for a second]

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         *No*!

               [duel resumes]

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         This is bar-*baric*! This is *no* way 
                         for grown men to settle - ! Oh! Fine! 
                         Let's just - *pull* out our swords and 
                         start *banging* away at each other! 
                         *This will solve everything!* I've had 
                         it! I've had enough! Wobbly-legged, 
                         rum-soaked... *pirates*! 
 
               [Elizabeth throws a rock at the duelists, but the rock goes far 
               to the left of them]

                         How'd this go all screwy?

                                     
                         Enough!)

                                     RAGETTI
                         Well, each wants the chest for hisself, 
                         don't 'e? Mister Norrington, I think 
                         he's tryna regain a bit of honor. Old 
                         Jack's lookin' to trade it, save his 
                         own skin. And Turner there - I figure 
                         'e's tryna... settle some unresolved 
                         business 'twixt him and his twice-cursed 
                         pirate father. 
 
                                     PINTEL
                         Sad. That chest must be worth more 'n 
                         a shiny penny. 
 
                                     RAGETTI
                         Oh! Tsk-tsk-tsk. Terrible temptation.
 
                         
                                     PINTEL
                         If we was any kind of *decent*, we'd 
                         remove temptation from their path.
 
                         
               [Pintel and Ragetti giggle and run off to steal the small chest]
 
               
                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Will! *Enough!*

               [Elizabeth is panting from exasperation and exhaustion]

                                     ELIZABETH SWANN
                         Oh! Oh...! The heat!

               [Elizabeth pretends to faint, which knocks off her hat]

               [Elizabeth watches sideways as the duelists continue fighting, 
               oblivious to her]
 
               [Elizabeth soon sits up, puts on her hat]

               [Pintel & Ragetti run by in the distance behind her, with the 
               chest]
 
               [Elizabeth sees Pintel & Ragetti, and goes to chase them]

               [various duel scenes on the beach]

               Bugger!

               [Norrington kicks sand in Will's face]

                         By your leave, Mister Turner.

               [Norrington runs off to chase Jack up the hill]

               [Jack and Norrington run through bushes on the beach, then up 
               to a dilapidated stone church on the hill] [P2] 
 
               [Norrington chases Jack up steps inside the building, Jack kicks 
               Norrington back down with his foot] 
 
               [Jack and Norrington have a swordfight on the inside steps]
 
               
               [Jack grabs hold of the bell rope, which carries him downward, 
               and carries Will upward, who just arrived]
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         By *your* leave, Mister Norrington.
 
                         
               [the Flying Dutchman crew on shore are at the large chest and 
               look up to the ringing bell in the building on the hill]
 
               [while Norrington and Will are dueling on top of the roof, Jack 
               deftly grabs the dangling key away from Norrington's hand]
 
               
               [noticing the key gone, Norrington then turns and duels with 
               Jack]
 
               [soon Norrington knocks Jack's sword from Jack's hand, the sword 
               is flung onto the ground below]
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                          Do excuse me while I kill the man who 
                         ruined my life.
 
                                     WILL TURNER
                         Be my guest.

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Let us examine that claim for a moment, 
                         former Commodore, shall we? Who was 
                         it, who at the very moment you had a 
                         notorious pirate safely behind bars, 
                         saw fit to *free* said pirate, and take 
                         your dearly beloved all to hisself, 
                         hey? So who's fault is it, *really*, 
                         that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand 
                         what takes orders from pirates?
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         Enough!

               [Jack somersaults off the roof to escape, Norrington turns to 
               Will]
 
                                     NORRINGTON
                         Unfortunately, Mister Turner... He's 
                         *right*!
 
               [Norrington and Will resume their part of the rooftop duel]

                         Still rooting for you, mate!

               [Jack picks up his sword from the ground, and puts the key around 
               his neck]
 
               [Jack walks through a graveyard, falls into an open grave] 
 
               
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Wup!

               [Jack stands up in the bottom of the hole]

                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Oh.

               [Norrington backs Will onto the top of the mill's waterwheel]
 
               
               [the axle of the wheel breaks off with Norrington and Jack dueling 
               on top]
 
               [Jack is facing the other direction, so is unaware of the freed 
               wheel rolling behind him]
 
               [the wheel crashes through a small fence, turns, and rolls directly 
               towards Jack]
 
               [the waterwheel rolls over Jack, and Jack is pulled into the 
               inside of the wheel]
 
                                     JACK SPARROW
                         Woah!

               [the key that Jack had around his neck falls off into the wheel]
 
               
               [Jack struggles to grab the key, which is caught and dangling 
               inside the rolling wheel]
 
               [Jack finally grabs the key, but hits his head on a metal bar 
               inside the wheel, and falls off the wheel] 
 
               [Pintel & Ragetti are running off with the small chest, each 
               holding one side, giggling]
 
               [Elizabeth steps in front Pintel & Ragetti, confronting them, 
               halts, panting]
 
               [Pintel & Ragetti drop the chest, pull their swords on Elizabeth]
 
               
               [Elizabeth reaches for her sword, but it's gone]

               [Pintel & Ragetti slowly advance on Elizabeth, she slowly retreats 
               while facing them]
 
               [they all pause for a moment to watch the wheel roll by with 
               the duel on top]
 
               [Jack is running behind the wheel, trying to catch up and get 
               the key that is still inside]
 
               [Pintel shrugs, Pintel and Ragetti resume advancing on Elizabeth]
 
               
               [suddenly a thrown axe embeds itself in a coconut palm next to 
               Elizabeth]
 
               [all three turn to see Jones' crew crashing through the bushes 
               toward them]
 
               [swordfight ensues with the Flying Dutchmen crew and Pintel and 
               Ragetti]

               top of the wheel]

               to the ground]

               small chest]

                         slimy git? Look what I got.  I got a
