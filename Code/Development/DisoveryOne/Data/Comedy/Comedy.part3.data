          INT. HAL FIELDS HOME.

          A single daisy stands in a vase in an empty kitchen.

                         

          INT. HAL'S BEDROOM

          OLIVER FIELDS clicks on the light to the closet. He looks at
          the rack of his parents' clothes.
          He begins to put some in a box marked "home", some in a box
          marked "thrift".

                         

          INT. HAL'S BATHROOM

          Oliver enters the bathroom and flushes bottle after bottle of
          pills and liquids down the toilet. Next he struggles as he
          looks over the old toothbrush, hairbrush, all the bottles and
          tubes besides the sink. He stares for a beat, then throws
          them all away.

                         

          INT/EXT. HAL'S TRASH AREA

          Oliver hauls trash outside, adding it to a very large pile of
          bags. An older Jack Russell Terrier, ARTHUR, follows him.

                         

          INT. HAL'S OFFICE

          Oliver and Arthur sit on the office floor surrounded by
          papers, boxes, books and trash bags. He finds a photo of HAL
          FIELDS in an open Jean jacket, no shirt, it's attached to a
          personal ad application which he begins to read.

          In the dark, OLIVER FIELDS has a tape recorder and
          microphone, he follows ANDY as he excitedly prepares, a group
          of friends looks on.

                          ANDY
           Okay. Is it on? (recorder)

                          OLIVER
           Yeah yeah.

                          ANDY
           This is for our friend Hal Fields.
           Hal. We love you.

          Andy quickly lights a rack of large fireworks, they shoot up
          into the night and explode - smoke - more explosions -
          everyone's laughing. Oliver looks up at the fireworks,
          recording the sounds, happy.

          BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

          Hal fields sits on a couch, in a purple sweater, looking into
          camera, struggling for words.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Six months later, my father told me
           he was gay. He had just turned 75.

                          HAL
           I'm gay.
          Same camera angle, Hal still looking into camera we jump cut

           OLIVER V.O. (CONT'D)
           I always remember him wearing a
           purple sweater when he told me this
           but actually he wore a robe.

          camera, each cut in different clothes, and with each cut his
          line has a different inflection.

           I'm gay.
          Jump cut, new outfit.

          Jump cut, new outfit.

                          HAL (CONT'D)
           I don't want to be just
           theoretically gay, I want to do
           something about it.

           physical trainer who was also
           studying for his professional

           never speaks to me. That's why
           I've been always attracted to older
           men.
          Hal and friends laugh warmly at Andy. We cut to live action
          "portraits" of a priest, a therapist, the Primetimers, his
          movie-night club, and the large L.A. Pride group, all looking
          into camera.

           OLIVER V.O.
           He found an out gay priest to guide
           him spiritually. He saw a therapist
           for the first time. He joined the

          through the living room - Arthur follows. Oliver makes a
          circle through the house - Arthur follows.
          Oliver sits, looking down at Arthur.

                          OLIVER
           Look, its lonely out here, so you'd
           better learn how to talk with me.
          Arthur's face looks up at him filled with a dog's love and no
          words.

           While I understand up to 150 words -
           I don't talk.

          INT. ICU ROOM - DAY

          QUICK CUTS. A nurse opens the shades. A DOCTOR and two nurses
          stand over Hal, everyone's nervous. Hal is struggling with
          all the tubes down his throat. Oliver is trying to help him
          breathe, talking into his ear.
          Oliver is ushered out of the room. The nurse draws the
          curtain.
          MOMENTS LATER: Oliver sits with Hal, now off the ventilator
          but still very weak and disoriented. Oliver coaches his
          breathing.

                          OLIVER
           Calm. Calm, calm breaths.

          in both arms, still disoriented, he's tangled up in the
          tubes, trying to pull them out of his arms. He wakes up

           Why not? She's great.
          The nurse smiles, embarrassed, and continues with her job.

           She's a great nurse in the
           hospital, we don't really know her,
           you're very high on drugs.

                          HAL
           You always have some very good
           reason, haven't you?

          door and finds Oliver drawing.

                          GEORGIA
           Oliver!
          He turns and Georgia shoots him with her finger, Oliver falls
          to the ground.

                          GEORGIA
           Olly, you can do better.
          He gets up and she shoots him again - He falls more
          dramatically, knocking his head on the floor.

                          GEORGIA
           That's good.
          His mom looks at him affectionately.

          Oliver walks Arthur across a lit field, towards the dog park.

                         

          EXT. DOG PARK - NIGHT

          Everywhere dogs and their people are playing. Oliver and
          Arthur sit on a bench like two humans. Oliver watches the
          action, Arthur stares at Oliver.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Go have your own experiences with
           your own people. I'll be right
           here...
          Arthur stays by Oliver's side.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           I'm a human. I'm not a dog.
           And you're a Jack Russell, that's a
           breed. Your personality was created
           by this guy John Russell, a hunting
           enthusiast, in the 1800s. And he
           bred your ancestors to have stamina
           and courage for the hunt. You think
           you're just you, and you want to
           chase the foxes, but other people
           planted that in you years ago.

           Now, somewhat arbitrarily, you are
           considered very cute by us humans,
           and we keep breeding you not to
           chase foxes, but to be cute, and we
           put you in movies and television
           shows, and you, you're chasing
           tennis balls cause there as close
           to a fox as you're going to get.

          JUMP CUT thru a series of Oliver's drawings. A speech bubble
          that reads: "A fair amount of failures." He draws portraits

          INT. HAL'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

          In the dark I.C.U. room, Hal is still attached to many I.V.s,
          Oliver is helping Hal look at a book of Japanese rock gardens
          with a flashlight.

                          OLIVER
           Want me to read this? I found it in
           your books.

                          HAL
           Yeah, alright. Give me the
           flashlight.
          Oliver opens it, they look at a few pages together, photos of
          serene gardens.

                          OLIVER
           Nice.

                          HAL
           Oh, that's nice.

          Hal keeps peeking at a bouquet of flowers in the corner of
          the room. Hal takes the flashlight from Oliver and guides it
          to the flowers.

                          OLIVER
           Oh, Andy brought those for you.

                          HAL
           Oh, yeah?
          Hal continues to direct the light across the room, we follow
          the circle of light as it moves a cross a wall landing on a
          painting.

                          HAL
           Oh, who did that painting?

                          OLIVER
           Well, I don't know. Its just a
           painting on the wall.
          Hal continues exploring, Oliver's enjoying his father's
          curiosity, he lands on some photos displayed on the table.

                          HAL
           A--, and these?

                          OLIVER
           They're just photos, Pop.

                          HAL
           But how do they relate to the
           exhibit?

                          OLIVER
           They're just personal photos.
           They're not art.
          Hal slowly moves the flashlight up the wall, across the
          ceiling to a strange assortment of fire detectors,
          sprinklers, sensors, all laid out against the acoustic tile
          ceiling. Hal points up. Oliver looks for a beat, then...

                          OLIVER
           Uh, well that's the water sprinkler
           thing.

                          HAL
           Well, its beautiful.

                          OLIVER
           What is?

                          HAL
           Putting the Japanese gardens there.
           It's just beautiful.

          Oliver looks from the ceiling to the rock garden book. The
          ceiling and the gardens look the same. Oliver is moved by
          Hal's confusion. ANDY, 45-years-old, physical, boyish, storms
          into the room.

                          ANDY
           Hal.

                          HAL
           Andy!
          Andy gets on the bed opposite Oliver. He gives Hal a big kiss
          on the lips. Hal glows. Oliver backs away slowly. Andy picks
          up Hal's hand, turns it palm up and presses his face into it.

                          ANDY
           I brought something for you.
          Oliver watches from outside the room as Andy excitedly pulls
          a portable tape player out of his bag.

                          ANDY
           We made a recording for
           you.

                          HAL
           Oh, God.
          Andy pushes play, on the recording we hear Andy's voice:

           ANDY ON TAPE
           This is for our friend Hal Fields.
           Hal. We love you.
          We hear voices HOOTING, and then large FIREWORKS, LAUGHTER
          and CLAPPING.
          Oliver watches his father's happiness from a distance.

          INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE

          CU on Oliver's hands drawing bright streaming colors of the
          fireworks.
          LATER: Oliver get's to his real work, pulling out a few 8X10
          photos of a band "The Sads". There are some instructions on
          record company letterhead - he is to do an album design for
          their new record - they want him to draw portraits of the
          three members.
          Oliver begins to do quick portraits of them based on the
          photo.

                          LIZ
           Well, at least it pays the rent.

                          OLIVER
           You do something decent once, and
           that's all people ever want.
          JUMP CUT through the different portraits developing. It's not

           Hi Liz.
          Oliver continues to draw, as Shauna and Elliott try to get
          his attention.

          Oliver, Elliott, and Shauna are leaving. Arthur can't believe
          he's being left behind. It's actually the first time they
          will separate.

                          OLIVER
           Arthur, you haven't been invited to
           this party. You're gonna stay and
           look after the house.
          Oliver tentatively shuts the door, takes three steps, Arthur
          begins to howl. Oliver tries to ignore it, but stops again.
          He looks back at the house and the howling.

          Arthur, victorious, sits in Elliot's lap in the front seat,

          chicken outfit.

                          ELLIOTT
           You remember when Oliver was funny?
           And he could actually, like, talk,
           in complete sentences?

                          SHAUNA
           Funny? Funny? I don't think so Fun
           maybe, but not funny unless, like,
           serious is funny. Then he's'
           fucking hilarious.
          Elliot and Oliver laugh.

                          SHAUNA
           But, lovable. You are very
           lovable.

                          ELLIOTT

          Oliver carries Arthur, they all enter a costume party, making
          their way through the crowd of people in all kinds of
          disguises, music blaring, Oliver slides into the less
          populated kitchen. A woman rushes up to Oliver, surprised to
          see he has a dog.

          In the background are a couple dressed as JULIAN and ETHEL
          ROSENBERG, we see them observe Oliver and Arthur.

                          PARTIER
           No? Arthur, SIT!
          Arthur promptly sits down. Oliver's totally surprised.

                          PARTIER
           He's so cute. Shake!
          Arthur sticks out his paw. Oliver doesn't like seeing Arthur
          blindly perform.

                          PARTIER
           Oh my god, he's so cute, I want
           him.

                          OLIVER
           (in Freud accent)
           Does it make you feel powerful to
           order my dog around? Maybe give
           you a sense of power?

                          PARTIER
           Oh, you're being a therapist!
           Freud!

                          OLIVER
           Thanks, yeah. Very good.
          Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The
          Rosenberg's are still watching.

          LATER...
          Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man
          dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black
          hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session.

                          LONG-HAIRED MAN
           Well, I didn't ask for this. Who
           would ask for this? This color.
           This nose. This cheek, this chin.
           You know, this is my life. This
           isn't a story. This isn't a
           joke...
          Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally
          ready for this party. He feels very far away.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

           my chest.

           (in Freud accent)
           I'm sorry. Our time is up, uh...
           for this week. Thank you for
           coming in.
          The witch moves on.
          Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this
          joviality.
          We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching
          him.
          Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down
          onto the couch, ready for her session.

           OLIVER V.O.
           Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a
           break, actually.
          She pulls out a writing pad, oblivious. Oliver can tell she's
          not going to give it up.

                          OLIVER
           (back in accent)
           Well, I guess we should start with
           your mother.
          The woman writes on her notepad and shows it to Oliver:
          "Never had one."

                          OLIVER
           Well then your father.
          She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.

                          OLIVER
           I don't understand. You can't
           talk? Is it a mental problem? Do
           you need analysis?
          She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"

                          OLIVER
           That's a physical problem.
          She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is
          more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes:
          "Why are you at a party if you're sad?"
          CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.

           I was doing such a good job of
           hiding it. How could you tell?
          Ethel holds up her notebook. She has drawn TWO EYES.
          Oliver's taken by her.

                          OLIVER
           Clearly, I'm gonna need a drink.
           You?
          She smiles and nods.

                          OLIVER
           You, stay here, yeah?
          Oliver moves to--

                         INT KITCHEN
          Elliot and Shauna are deeply engaged in conversation with
          someone dressed as a pickle and someone dressed as much less
          colorful chicken.

                          ELLIOTT
           No, its just not a natural color
           for a chicken.

                          SHAUNA
           No.

                          ELLIOTT
           (motioning to Shauna's

                          COSTUME)
           And look, you see what happens when
           you free yourself from the cage,
           walk away from the factory.

                          SHAUNA
           You just have no real color.

                          YOU'RE LIKE--
          Oliver slips past, hands Arthur to Elliot. He scoops ice
          from the bucket and starts filling two cups.

                          ELLIOTT
           Hey, hey.

                          SHAUNA

                          (COUNTING CUPS)
           Uh-oh, one. Uh-oh, two.

                          ELLIOTT
           Two drinks.

                          SHAUNA
           What does that me--, one, two.

           Two people. A girl and a guy?

                          ELLIOTT
           Hopefully.

                          SHAUNA
           Yeah, wow, making moves.
          Oliver leaves Arthur in Elliott's arms.

                          OLIVER
           Watch him OK?
          Oliver begins to leave his drinks. We see his POV of the
          woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg waiting on the couch.
          Oliver slips into one of his memories...

          INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM/INT. HAL'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          INTERCUT: The phone RINGS, wakes up Oliver, he turns on the
          light, answers the phone. PRE-CANCER Hal talks excitedly.

                          OLIVER
           Hello?

                          HAL
           Oliver?

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

                          HAL
           I'm not sorry I woke you!
           I went to Akbar tonight.

                          OLIVER
           You did?

                         

          INT. AKBAR - NIGHT

          Hal and his friends, BRIAN and ROBERT, make their way through
          a crowded gay club. Hal is by far the oldest, and most
          excited, man there.

           They had wonderfully loud music. In-
           sit, in-sit, in-sit. What kind of
           music is that?

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Probably house music?

                         

          INT. HAL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Hal gets a pad and pen to write this down.

                          HAL
           "House music."

                         

          INT. AKBAR - NIGHT

          A bunch of Young Gay guys dance. Hal is on the side, dancing
          by himself, hands in the air twinkling his fingers.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           So did you meet anyone?
          At the packed bar, Hal drinks alone.

           HAL (V.O.)
           Young gay men don't go for older
           gay men.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S HOUSE CONTINUOUS

          Back to Oliver in bed, on the phone.

          INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

          Oliver snaps out of his memory. He makes his way through the
          crowd and delivers the drink to her. He looks at her a little
          too intensely, then blurts out.

                          OLIVER
           Would you like to dance?
          She happily nods yes. They walk to the dance floor, we think
          Oliver's going to be shy, but he breaks into a kinetic,
          angular, dance. She's surprised with us - she laughs, they
          have a good time.

          JUMP CUT THROUGH THE NIGHT: Oliver, "Julius", Elliott and
          Shauna are talking to a magician. "Julius" picks a card, the
          magician mixes it into the full deck, pops a card into the
          air, it is hers. Shauna and Elliott can see that Oliver's
          coming alive.
          LATER. They dance again, now they're sweaty, the dance
          floor's packed - it's the pinnacle of the party.

                         

          INT. PARTY BATHROOM - NIGHT

          The party's winnowing down in the background - "Julius" and
          Oliver look at each other in the mirror for a beat, and then
          simultaneously take their wigs off, revealing their true
          selves.

                          OLIVER
           Hello...
          Shes mouths a silent "hi"...

                          OLIVER
           Can I give you my number?
          She pulls out her pad and pen and hands them to him.

                          OLIVER
           Thanks.
          As he writes, Oliver spies Arthur sitting in the corner of
          the bathroom, staring directly at him.

                          ARTHUR SUBTITLE
           Tell her the darkness is about to
           drown us unless something drastic
           happens right now.
          Oliver looks to her.

                          OLIVER
           I feel bad dragging Arthur to the
           party. I should get home. It was
           really nice meeting you.
          She writes on her pad: "Au Revoir"

                          OLIVER

                          (CHUCKLES)
           Au revoir. Yeah.
          He leaves.

                          OLIVER
           Hello?
          ON THE OTHER END: Silence. A little breathing, the party in
          background.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Is that you?

          BEEP.

           call with someone who doesn't
           talk...

          BEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           You want to do something?

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Now?

          BEEP.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Okay, I'm parked just right up the
           street.
          BEEP. They hang up. Oliver is filled with hope.
          CUT TO: "Julius" walking out into a pool of street light.
          They smile at each other, but don't say anything. They get
          into his car.

                          OLIVER
           Okay. You point - I'll drive.
          Oliver starts the engine. She points forward and they head
          off. At the light she points left, he follows. Down the
          street she points right...

                          OLIVER
           This way?

          street, heads down it for half a block, then takes her right.
          We can hear them laughing.

                         

          EXT./INT. HOTEL ROOM LOBBY - NIGHT

          Oliver, Arthur and the woman enter a very fancy hotel lobby.
          Oliver is impressed. She mime's giving him a tour but still
          doesn't talk.

                          OLIVER
           Nice place.
          They sit on her bed. She steals his pipe, put's it in her
          mouth -- writes on her pad and shows it to him.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Oh, my mother. My mother died five
           years ago.

           (in a hoarse whisper)
           Oh merd.

          She writes and present him with a new question.

                          OLIVER
           My father died two months ago,
           almost three.
          She looks at him with sincere empathy and surprise. Oliver's
          opened up, an now everything gushes out, he barely knows what
          he's saying.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           He, he was gay.
          She's very surprised.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)

           married.

          There's a quiet moment of deep connection.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Sorry.
          She mouths "No" (don't say sorry). She reaches out and gently
          runs a finger across Oliver's brow and the outline of his
          face, he's so vulnerable, she lovingly/mischievously squishes
          his face together and messes up his hair. Then she leans in,
          and they kiss for the first time - delicately.

                          ANNA

                          (WHISPER)

           Sure, sure.
          They lay down, she takes his arm and pulls him into spooning
          her. He pulls the covers over them.

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

          Oliver wakes, still in his clothes. ANNA is already up. She
          waves and Oliver smiles.
          Anna holds up her notebook: "Who are you?"

                          OLIVER
           Oliver.
          She writes again: "Go to NY. Audition. Back Thursday."

           How long are you here when you get
           back?
          Anna holds up one finger.

                          OLIVER
           A year?
          Anna shakes her head and smiles. She gestures smaller.

                          OLIVER
           A month? Right. And then?...
          She pantomimes a camera rolling, and herself acting.

                          OLIVER
           You're filming here. Acting.

           And after?...
          She makes a casual tossing motion with her hand.

                          OLIVER
           Just somewhere else. Where?
          Anna only shrugs. She writes more, and tosses the notepad on
          his lap. Oliver reads: "Can I see you again?"
          He's very happy.

                          OLIVER
           Yes.

          INT. OLIVER HOUSE ENTRY WAY

          Oliver and Arthur enter his home, much more alive than the
          last time we saw him come through the door.

                          OLIVER
           Hello house, (Low voice) hello
           Oliver.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S DINING ROOM - DAY

          Oliver makes two piles of mail, one says Oliver Fields, one
          has a yellow forwarding sticker that says Hal Fields. The Hal
          Fields pile is much bigger.

                          OLIVER
           Jesus, Pop, you get so much mail.
          Oliver slows and stares at his father's magazine - The
          Advocate. Two attractive, shirtless men on the cover under
          the title: America's Sweethearts. Oliver's lost in memory...

           DOCTOR LONG (O.S.)
           Hal, its remarkable how well you've
           recovered from being on the
           ventilator.

                         

          INT. HAL'S HOSPITAL ROOM

          Hal sit's on top of his hospital bed, wearing one of his all
          black outfits, looking much healthier. A doctor sits on his
          bed, Oliver listens from the side.

                          HAL
           But...?

                          DOCTOR LONG
           The bronchoscopy revealed a mass
           about the size of a quarter. It is
           located in your lower right lung.
          CU on Hal taking this in.

           DOCTOR LONG (CONT'D)
           I'm afraid the biopsy showed it's
           cancerous.

                          HAL
           Uh-huh. I see.

                          DOCTOR LONG
           It appears to have spread... to the
           large hilar lymph nodes in your
           chest and liver.

           With the already weakened state of
           your heart and lungs...
          As Dr. Long talks about treatments, Oliver drifts back from
          the conversation, slowly retreating to a window in the far
          corner, as we continue to hear Dr. Long speak, we see
          Oliver's thoughts, fixating on "a mass about the size of a

                         QUARTER"

                         WE HEAR:

           DR. LONG (O.S.) (CONT'D)
           ... Surgery isn't possible given
           its location. We can start
           radiation treatments and see if
           you're strong enough for Chemo. You
           will be able to go home.

                         WE SEE:

          SHOT OF A QUARTER ON BLACK

          SHOT OF TWO DIMES AND A NICKEL

          SHOT OF 5 NICKELS.

          SHOT OF 25 PENNIES.
          We cut back to Hal's face, stoically digesting the news.

                          DOCTOR LONG
           Do you have any questions?

                          HAL
           No. Thank you.
          As the doctor leaves. Oliver takes his father's hand.

                          OLIVER
           I'm sorry.

                          HAL
           Well, let's not rush out and tell
           everyone.

                          OLIVER
           Andy?

                          HAL
           No need to get him up a tree.
          Hal takes a moment and composes himself. In his eyes we can
          see that he knows there is an end to his life.

                          HAL (CONT'D)
           Can you read me something?

           The Brazilian ballet star is

           Yeah, yeah, he's eating.

                          HAL
           Oh God, I worry so much about--
          As Andy enters, his hands mysteriously cupped together.

                          HAL
           Oh here we are...
          Andy shows Hal his cupped hands.

           A slug.

           Oh, Andy, you can't bring that kind
           of thing in here.

                          ANDY
           Oh I can look.
          Andy flashes open his hands, revealing nothing. He snorts and
          laughs.

                          HAL
           Fuck you.
          Oliver watches with amusement. NURSE SOPHIA enters...

           It's time for inspection...
          The nurse works her way between Andy and Hal to take his
          pulse.

           Hello, Mr. Fields.

                         

                         

                          HAL
           Hello.
          Andy feels interrupted, strangely hurt by the nurse. The
          nurse begins to take Hal's vital signs.

           You know, I have the right to be
           here as much as anyone else.
          Hal lovingly cuts him off, trying to ease the tension.

                          HAL
           Go take a walk. Calm yourself.
          Andy walks out, feeling embarrassed and rejected.

           nice to him.
          To everyone's surprise, Andy storms back in with a bouquet of
          flowers, dumps them on Hal's chest, kisses him triumphantly
          and leaves again.

                          HAL

           Guys, guys, this is to us. Cheers.
          A NURSE suddenly enters.

           Oh, it's not?
          She shakes her head no, the party stops, she leaves. Oliver
          instinctively polite, starts packing up their cups.

                          OLIVER
           I'm sorry.
          Moans and complaints from the group.

                          HAL
           No, no, no. She's a wonderful
           nurse. (he pauses a beat, then
           raises his cup again) Here's to
           health care.
          Hal swigs back his wine. They all laugh, grab their cups and
          toast.

                          EVERYONE
           To health care!
          Hal looks happy, Oliver smiles but can't believe his dad.

           L-E-IT, Elliot

                          OLIVER
           Well, that's ridiculous.

                          ELLIOTT
           I know! (Getting his criticism
           more) You're not very supportive.

                          OLIVER
           Well, its just copying something
           someone did, like, 30 years ago in
           the Bronx.

                          ELLIOTT
           Well yeah. I'm part of a tradition
           of civil disobedience, something
           bigger than myself.
          Oliver can't believe Elliott said that.

                         

          EXT. NEW STREET

          Elliott drives along-side Oliver who's walking with a spray
          paint can, terrified as he's never done this before. He
          tries to spray, nothing comes out.

                          OLIVER
           How does it work?

                          ELLIOTT
           Shake it, you have to shake it.
          Oliver shakes it awkwardly, then sprays across the wall:

          1985 BUSH FINDS JESUS
          Oliver runs back to the car, exhilarated.

                          ELLIOTT
           What was that?

                          OLIVER
           Historical consciousness... you
           know, something bigger than myself.
          Elliott scoffs.

                          OLIVER
           Let's do it again.
          Elliott drives off. Oliver's coming to life.

          EXT. OLIVER'S HOUSE DAY

          Oliver exits his house alone, down his front stairs to the
          street. Halfway down, he hears now familiar sound of Arthur
          barking and howling. Oliver can't believe it.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM

          Anna is sitting on the bed, gently petting Arthur.

                          ANNA
           He's sweet. He misses your Dad.
          She stops. Gets up, nervous, and walks past Oliver into the
          next room. Oliver follows her in. They pause uncomfortably,
          Anna suddenly leans in and kisses him. Before it goes to
          far...

                          OLIVER
           Maybe we, we could, um, just talk
           for a second.

                          ANNA
           Right.
          They awkwardly break apart. Anna goes to a chair, Oliver
          follows. While nothing has really been expressed between the
          two, Anna seems to understand the problem.

                          ANNA
           Well, my name is Anna. You're
           worried you can't trust me because
           you don't know who I am. I get it.
           That makes sense to me.
          She falters, looks at him vulnerably. Oliver abruptly kisses
          her. She pushes back. They pause. She traces his brow slowly
          with her index finger, the way she did their first night.

          The music carries us, they lie in bed, naked. Anna innocently
          leans over and takes Oliver's arm and bites down hard. He
          grimaces. She stops and kisses it, admiring her teeth marks.
          She gets up, sits at a side table and finds her cigarettes.
          Oliver watches her.
          The music seems to bend and slow down, this continues as we
          fall into memory...

          bending, slowing sounds.

           Oliver, stop it.

                         
          Oliver stands up bored, Georgia's in the connecting bathroom
          getting ready to go out.

                          OLIVER
           This music's old.

                          GEORGIA
           It's black, black music is the
           deepest cause they suffered the
           most, them and the Jews.
          Oliver plops down on the bed, listening to her.

                          GEORGIA
           In my next life I'm gonna marry a
           good hot blooded Jew - someone full
           of emotion.

                          OLIVER
           I'm Jewish right?
          Georgia comes and sits with him, caresses his hair as she
          talks with him.

                          GEORGIA AT 50

           than him, but I'll have the most

          10 year old Oliver's in the driving sear, Georgia smokes and
          admires his handling of the car.

                          GEORGIA
           You're turning into a wonderful
           driver.
          Oliver's proud.

                         

          INT. LACMA ART MUSEUM STEPS DAY

          Oliver escorts Georgia up the large steps of the museum. The
          crowd from an opening gathers at the top.

                         

          INT. DAVID SMITH GALLERY LACMA DAY

          Georgia and Oliver approach a David Smith sculpture. After
          staring at it's angels for a beat, Georgia begins to do an
          angular modern-dance-pantomime of the sculpture, imitating
          it's shapes with her body. Oliver locks up with
          embarrassment. A confused and concerned museum guard
          approaches.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Excuse me Mrs. Fields....

                          GEORGIA
           What? You're not allowed to
           interact with the art?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           It's just that...

                          OLIVER
           C'mon.
          Still embarrassed, Oliver takes Georgia's hand and walks her
          away from the guard.

                          GEORGIA
           You too? You like being a good
           citizen?

          Anna's sits in her kimono. Oliver's buttoning his shirt.

                          ANNA
           Can you toss me my camisole.
          Oliver throws a sweater.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           No, my camisole.
          She throws the sweater back at him. Oliver looks around
          helplessly. He grabs a flower out of a vase and hands it to
          her.

                          OLIVER
           Camisole?
          Anna laughs.

                          ANNA
           You don't know what a camisole is?

                          OLIVER
           I was brought up by these animals
           and they didn't like questions.
          They're both smiling now.

                          OLIVER
           They were very frowned upon. So I
           had to guess.
          Anna takes this in.

                          ANNA
           You can ask me anything.

                          OLIVER
           Anything?
          CUT TO: Oliver and Anna at the window.

          She points.

           Another building like this one.

                          OLIVER
           Right.

                          ANNA
           People in the building like us.
           Half of them think things will
           never work out. The other half
           believe in magic. It's like a war
           between them.
          Oliver smiles. He moves away from the window.

                          OLIVER
           How do you know so much about
           people?

                          ANNA
           Oh. Well, you have to learn how to
           read their faces.
          She climbs onto his lap, straddles him.

                          ANNA
           For example... here is mad.
          Anna passes her hand across her face, and she's "mad".

                          ANNA
           Happy...
          Her hand passes again and she's "happy".

                          ANNA
           Sometimes its just nothing.

                          OLIVER
           Oh yeah?
          She points at her blank face.

                          ANNA
           This is nothing... And they are
           good at looking one way and being
           another way.
          Her playfulness is very meaningful to Oliver, he's in love.

          EXT. FREEWAY PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS

          They walk through a caged-in freeway overpass - Oliver is
          carrying Arthur while blindfolding Anna with his hands. Over
          this we hear the sounds of the quiet hotel room and an
          intimate conversation between them.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           You don't know me. I like that.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           No, that's not true.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Oh yeah?

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Yeah, you have blonde hair that
           goes down to about here. You smoke
           in non-smoking rooms.
          Oliver is still covering her eyes, leading her to a certain
          point, the busy sound of the freeway fading up...

                          OLIVER
           Okay, open your eyes...
          HIGH ANGLE on huge trucks and traffic racing just beneath
          Oliver and Anna's feet under the overpass. The trucks lay on
          their horns as they pass, scaring and thrilling them.
          MOMENTS LATER: they walk alongside the LA river together, arm
          in arm, happy. The intimate conversation continues in voice
          over.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Oh yeah? You drive on the sidewalk.
           You were raised by animals.
           Sometimes you look very alone, like
           you just got here.
          They meet up with friends on the banks of the river.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Yeah, you see, you don't know me at
           all.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL HALLWAY

          Oliver and Arthur are leaving, walking down the long hallway
          together. Arthur seems to stop and look up at Oliver.

                          ARTHUR SUBTITLE
           She's unlike any girl I've ever
           met.

           There are other steps, it's
           complicated.
          They look at each other a beat and then walk on together.

          INT. HAL FIELD'S HOUSE- DAY

          Hal's friends hold up a hand-made "WELCOME HOME" sign in the
          living room. Oliver helps Hal walk to his crew, Andy at the
          center holding Arthur.

                          HAL
           Hello house (Answers back in deep
           voice) Hello Hal.
          Andy holds Arthur. Hal and Arthur kiss. They've clearly
          missed each other.
          JUMP CUTS: Oliver takes bottles of pills and syrups and
          inhalers out of a Sav-On bag. He makes a chart of the
          medicine, the dosage, and puts the pills in a dish. It's
          emotional job for him.

                         

          INT. HAL'S DINING/KITCHEN

          Oliver watches as Andy sneaks up behind Hal with his hands
          cupped closed. Hal turns and smiles.

                          HAL
           Oh God, what have you got this
           time?

                          ANDY
           It's a green caterpillar.

                          HAL
           No, no, no, you don't have a green
           caterpillar.

                          ANDY
           Oh yeah I do.

          caterpillar.

                          HAL
           Oh my God. Gross! Oh, Jesus...

                          (LAUGHING)
          Andy puts the caterpillar down on the saucer of Hal's tea
          cup, gives him a big kiss, and starts to leave...

                          HAL
           Hey, you going?

                          ANDY
           Yeah, Michael's in town.

                          HAL
           Oh. Right.
          Andy waves goodbye and leaves. Hal is sad but covering it
          up. He catches Oliver watching.

                          OLIVER
           I thought he was your boyfriend?

                          HAL
           Well, at least I'm the number one
           boyfriend.
          Hal grimaces in pain, doubles over.

                          OLIVER
           Pop.

                          HAL
           Oh, my stomach.

                          OLIVER
           Alright, come on. Come on.
          Oliver tries to clear the couch of books and dogs for Hal to
          sit down.

                          OLIVER
           Arthur, down.

                          HAL
           Well, let's say, when you were
           little, you always dreamed of some
           day getting a lion?
          Oliver eases Hal down onto the couch.

           wait and you wait and the lion
           doesn't come. Then along comes a
           giraffe.
          Oliver helps Hal get his feet up.

                          HAL
           You can be alone or you can be with
           the giraffe.

                          OLIVER
           I'd wait for the lion.
          Oliver grabs the oxygen tubes and puts them on Hal's face.

                          HAL
           That's why I worry about you.
          Hal looks at Oliver with love and concern.

          CU on Oliver's hands as he writes "THE HISTORY OF SADNESS".
          CUT TO him drawing an explosion with the caption: "EARTH
          BEGINS (SADNESS NOT YET INVENTED)". He draws a man and a
          woman with the caption: "FIRST COUPLE TO MARRY FOR WRONG
          REASONS." He draws a spilled glass - "INVENTION OF ALCOHOL,
          ANCIENT EGYPT." He draws a man's face and torso: "FIRST GAY
          MAN ACCUSED OF BEING MENTALLY ILL." He draws a man labelled
          "PRESENT" having been crushed by a giant boulder labelled

          "PAST."
          Oliver stops drawing, thinking of a conversation with his
          father. CUT TO: Hal on his couch (previous scene) talking to
          Oliver.

                          HAL
           You want me to be with someone like
           me. I like Andy cause he's not like
           me... he's fun.

          Arthur runs down the hotel hallway, followed by Oliver, they

          and continue on together.

          INT. MELROSE BOOK STORE NIGHT

          Oliver and Anna are in the overcrowded used book store we saw
          earlier. Oliver sees her down the aisle.

                          OLIVER
           Hey, what did you get?
          She puts the cover of Liv Ullman's "Changing" over her face -
          Ullman's face on the cover becomes Anna's.

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Liv Ullman. Very serious.

                          ANNA
           And I found this crazy book.
          She holds an old copy of THE JOY OF SEX in front of her face.

                          OLIVER
           That's kind of a classic American
           thing.
          Anna opens the book to a large drawing of a couple having
          sex.

                          ANNA
           Maybe we can figure out some
           classic American things to do.
          Oliver takes the book and flips through the pages.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, Like page 75?

                          ANNA
           Uh-huh.

                          OLIVER
           Or 75 all the way through, through

           80.

          LATER...
          Oliver, Anna and Arthur sit at the end of an aisle looking at
          a book on "Old Hollywood". The book has a photo of Louise
          Brooks from the Twenties.

                          OLIVER

                          (READING)
           Louise Brooks, star of silent
           screen... effectively banned from
           Hollywood in early Thirties, ended
           up working as a salesgirl at Saks

          Veronica Lake.

                          OLIVER
           Veronica Lake.

                          ANNA
           Oh I love her.

                          OLIVER
           She was a pin-up model and a film
           star... Success was short-lived...
           series of broken marriages... She
           struggled with mental illness and
           alcoholism. She died of hepatitis
           at the age of 53.

                          ANNA
           All these actor stories end sad. I
           can tell you that already. It's
           not a good life.
          Oliver closes the book, they share a look, and something
          vulnerable. Anna changes the mood, pulls out The Joy Of Sex,
          skips through the pages as she talks.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           So. Now I want real Mexican food.
          She stops on an illustration she likes.

                          ANNA (CONT'D)
           And I want to try page... 46.

                         

          EXT. STREET TACO TRUCK - NIGHT

          Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk up to a typical L.A. Taco truck
          on the side of the street. There is nothing fancy looking
          about it.

                          ANNA
           No.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah.

                          ANNA
           Really?

                          OLIVER
           It's really good.
          JUMP CUT: They're sitting on milk crates by the truck, ready
          to take their first bite, Anna dives in un-selfconsciously,
          we're not sure what she thinks.

           It's so good.
          Oliver's so relieved.

                          OLIVER
           It's good? Oh, I wasn't sure you'd
           like it.

                          ANNA
           Why?

                          OLIVER
           You're an actress and staying in

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM

          They lie on the bed, continuing their conversation, side by
          side, looking up at the ceiling together.

                          ANNA
           I used to love hotels. But now I'm
           always in a new apartment or... in
           another hotel somewhere.

                          OLIVER
           How do you keep hold of friends...
           or boyfriends?

                          ANNA
           It makes it very easy to end up
           alone - to leave people.

                          OLIVER
           You can stay in the same place and
           still find ways to leave people.
          She reaches up with her hand, their fingers intertwine.

                          ANNA
           You are like that? Its what you do?
          Oliver nods yes. They know each other much better than either
          one knew.

                          ANNA
           So we are the same?

          Thumps and loud 1920's music wakes Oliver in the middle of
          the night. He turns the lights on, discombobulated.
          He gets up, works his way through the dark house. Turning on

           Yeah.

           Jewish girls are not pretty. They

           That's what my mom told me.

           She did not.
          Anna laughs. As Anna continues to explain, the sound begins

           No, you're right, this girl at

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           My mother didn't know she was
           Jewish until she was 13. It was
           1938. This is what people looked
           like.

          THEN LIONS AND GIRAFFES FROM 1938. THEN ADOLF HITLER ON TIME

          MAGAZINE COVER.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           And lions and giraffes. This man
           was Man of the Year.

          THEN GEORGIA'S FATHER IN 1938, GEORGIA'S SWIM TEAM PHOTO.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Her father tried to hide that they
           were Jewish. This is the swim team
           that asked her to leave once they
           discovered that she was Jewish.

          THEN A QUICK SERIES OF ANGLO LOOKING FEMALE MODELS AND PIN-

          UP'S FROM 1938.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           This is what pretty looked like in

           1938.

          NOW A STILL PHOTO OF HAL IN 1938.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           My father realized he was gay when
           he was 13. It was 1938.

          THEN A SERIES OF PHOTOS OF MALE MODELS IN SWIM SUITS AND

          EXERCISING.

           This is the high school where they
           first met. This is the war they
           both went to. And this man was
           popular when they met again.

          NOW A PHOTO OF A PUBLIC RESTROOM.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           This is the only place my father
           could hide and have sex in the
           Fifties.

          NOW HISTORICAL FILM FOOTAGE OF GAY MEN BEING BUSTED BY THE

          VICE SQUAD IN THE 1950'S AND BEING LOADED INTO PATTY-WAGONS.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           My father said if you got caught my
           the Vice Squad you could lose
           everything...
           This is everything.

          NOW A STILL PHOTOGRAPH OF A PSYCHIATRISTS COUCH.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           My father laid down on a couch like
           this and told the psychiatrist all
           his problems in 1955. The doctor
           told him that homosexuality was a
           mental illness, but it could be
           cured.

          AND THEN A MEDICAL MODEL OF A HUMAN BRAIN.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Not everyone got cured.

          AND THEN A STILL FROM ALLEN GINSBERG'S 1955 APARTMENT.

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Allen Ginsburg was writing his
           famous poem, Howl, blocks away in
           this room.

          INT. OLIVER'S OFFICE - DAY

          GINSBERG'S READING CONTINUES OVER: Oliver flips through a
          mock-up he made for "The Sads" - it's all the happy faces
          from 1950's advertising that we saw in the last scene. One
          face per-panel.
          LATER: the three members of "The Sads" and a RECORD COMPANY
          REP arrive. Jelly Roll Morton piano plays, we see but do not
          hear the meeting take place. The Sads look at the designs,
          which include many of the "History Of Sadness" drawings we
          have seen now in CD cover format - and no portraits of the
          band. It's clear that The Sads are not into Oliver's work.
          CUT TO: After the meeting, the RECORD COMPANY REP talks to
          Oliver alone.

           RECORD COMPANY LADY
           Just do the portrait of them, it's
           an album cover, right? That's what
           they want. Yeah?
          Oliver's very disappointed but polite.

          INT. HAL'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Oliver walks into Hal's living room, carrying his full tray
          of medication.

                          OLIVER
           Here, Pop.

                          HAL
           Oh, God.

                          OLIVER
           I know, I know. Come on.
          Hal begins taking his many pills, with each one he pings his
          glass with a teaspoon as he swallows. The room is cluttered
          with books. Oliver picks up a toppling pile of files from a
          paper-filled side table.

                          HAL
           Hey, no, no, no. That's the Gay
           Pride Day stuff. Just leave those.

                          OLIVER
           Alright.
          Oliver begins to neaten a messy pile of books on top of a
          chair.

                          HAL
           And that's for gay book club. You
           better leave those too.

                          OLIVER
           But what about this chair? Is it
           gay?

                          HAL
           The chair's not gay. Obviously.
          Hal gets up and walks to the kitchen, his oxygen cannon cord
          is attached to the pump behind him, stopping him short.

           Pop, Pop, the cord won't go that
           far.

                          HAL
           Oh, to hell with it.
          Hal pulls off the oxygen and keeps walking, frail but
          determined. Andy enters with a large pilates ball.

                          HAL
           Oh, hey what's that?

                          ANDY
           Now that you're out of the
           hospital, you'll have to exercise,
           get you back into shape.
          Oliver can't believe it.

                          HAL
           That's a great idea.

                          ANDY
           Okay, let's try it. I'll, I'll show
           you how.
          Hal's still heading to the sink.

                          HAL
           Yeah, later on, I'm gonna make
           myself some tea.

                          ANDY
           Okay, I'll clean it up. It's a
           little - yech.
          Andy walks out, Hal pours water into a kettle, in front of
          him on the window sill is the same vase from the first scene
          of the film, with some dead daisies in it.

                          HAL
           Your mother's vase needs some
           flowers.
          Oliver looks at them frustrated and uneasy...

                         

          INT. STAPLES - DAY

          Oliver and Hal walk amongst all the products. Hal wears his
          portable oxygen and grabs different kinds of papers, dumping
          them in the basket Oliver holds.

                          OLIVER
           Pop, you just got out of the
           hospital, you should take it easy.

           You need to tell Andy that
           you're... not well.
          Hal, continues on, avoiding looking at Oliver.

                         

                          HAL
           You'll tell him, won't you?
          Oliver's flabbergasted, but his dad's vulnerability is clear
          to him.

                          OLIVER
           Me?

                          HAL

          INT. HAL'S GUEST HOUSE - DAY

          Andy's on an elliptical trainer, through a window we can see
          Oliver approaching with the weight of the world on his
          shoulders. Andy see's him, can immediately sense that
          something is wrong.

                          OLIVER
           Hey.
          Oliver approaches seriously, this makes Andy nervous, he
          stops his workout. Oliver tries to find his words.

                          ANDY
           You know that I tried to have sex
           with women?

                          OLIVER
           Yeah?

                          ANDY
           Yeah. I wanted you to know I
           tried, it just, it didn't work.

                          OLIVER
           Hey, I don't have a problem with
           gay guys.

                          ANDY
           Have you ever had sex with a man?

                          OLIVER
           No.

           I heard that if a man hasn't had
           sex with another man, he's always
           afraid of gay men. You know,
           they're a threat.
          Oliver's blown away by the logic.

                          OLIVER
           I don't know Andy.

                          ANDY
           I didn't want you to feel
           threatened, I don't want to have
           sex with you. What I do, most
           people wouldn't even call it sex.
          Andy's relieved he got this off his chest, all tension is
          relieved for him, Oliver is just confused.

                          OLIVER
           Okay, okay.

                          ANDY

           That's okay.

                          OLIVER
           No it's not. You can't hide this
           from him. He loves you.

                          HAL
           For someone with so much
           relationship advice, you seem
           awfully alone.
          Oliver, angry but at a loss for words, takes the flower vase

          The three enter, the phone is ringing, Anna is staring at it

          up.

                          ANNA
           Don't, don't.
          It keeps ringing.

                          OLIVER
           He's that bad?
          She picks up the phone, and gestures for Oliver to pick up
          the line next to him.

           I'll be my dad, you be me.

          She gestures again, Oliver picks up the phone on his side of

                          ANNA
           You know, I can't stop thinking
           about, you know, about it. Doing
           it.

                          OLIVER
           Doing what?

                          ANNA
           Killing myself. You are the only
           one I can tell that to.
          Oliver breaks role, turns around looks at her.

                          OLIVER
           You should tell mom about that, not
           me.
          She just looks at him. Back into phone.

                          ANNA
           You are my girl.
          They hang up. She's embarrassed, she lightens the mood to get
          out of this intimacy.

                          ANNA
           Now I have to kill you.

                          OLIVER
           Just as it was going so well.

                          ANNA
           I know. I'm sorry.
          She tosses a pillow over his face and pretends to shoot him
          twice. She pulls the pillow back tentatively, he's smiling.

                          OLIVER
           Hey Anna?

                          ANNA
           Hey Oliver?

                          OLIVER
           How do you feel about vandalism?
          It's the last question she thought he'd ask. She's amused.

          EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS/INT. CAR - NIGHT

          Anna, Oliver, Elliott, Shauna and Arthur drive up Sunset
          Blvd. They arrive at Alvarado, park and get out. Above them a
          well lit large blank/white billboard. As Oliver and Elliott
          get spray paint cans from the back of the car...

                          ELLIOTT
           Oliver, don't write any of that
           serious stuff, okay? Just write
           something funny. Girls like funny.

                         

          EXT. ROOFTOP

          The gang get to the top of the stairs, on to the roof where
          they can see the large blank billboard towering in front of
          them.

                          SHAUNA
           You know what? Here, give me
           Arthur. We'll just stay here and
           get arrested. You know, that's
           good.
          Oliver leaves Arthur with her, and Anna and Elliott and him
          head off to the billboard. They climb it's structure, it's
          high and a bit scary. On the top is a gang plank looking over
          the city. Anna is happy she came. Elliott goes to paint the
          back side of the billboard. Oliver meets up with Anna, over
          looking the city.

                          OLIVER
           You okay?

                          ANNA
           Yeah. I'm gonna stay here with my
           new friend (the handrail she
           holds).

                          OLIVER
           Okay.
          Oliver walks out and writes big letters across the billboard.

          YOU MAKE ME LAUGH BUT IT'S NOT FUNNY.
          He makes his way back. Anna's not where she was, he looks and
          finds her in the gangways between the two billboards with a
          view to downtown below her.

                          ANNA
           C'est beau ici.

           I'm trying to impress you.

                          ANNA
           (Gasps ironically) Really?
          She walks to him and puts her hands around his head, somehow
          it's more intimate and vulnerable now.

                          ANNA
           It's working.

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL - NIGHT

          Oliver, Anna and Arthur walk down the hallway. Arthur bolts
          ahead suddenly, getting free of Oliver, he runs to and OLD
          MAN - wearing all black and looking just like Hal. Oliver
          runs up to stop Arthur.

                          OLIVER
           Arthur, Arthur. I'm sorry.
          We see the old man's face, it's not Hal, but it the
          resemblance hits Oliver too. The man is struggling with his
          hotel key card.

                          OLD MAN
           Oh. No problem. No problem. What's
           with this card?

                          OLIVER (CONT'D)
           Uh, do you mind?
          Oliver swipes the man's key, the door opens.

                          OLD MAN
           Thank you.
          He disappears. Oliver looks overwhelmed by this ghost. Anna
          senses what's happened. She leads Oliver to their room.

          She wants to take care of him, she lays him back on the bed,
          helps him take his coat off, she's sitting on him, caressing
          him - Oliver is overwhelmed by memory.

                          OLIVER

           he was sick.

           Eventually Jesus grew old. He could
           no longer walk far and he could no
           longer preach in a loud voice. One
           day he announced to his apostles
           that he was departing. The three
           disciples prayed with him, gave him
           water, bathed and fed him. After
           gasping for breath for several
           days, one morning, just as dawn
           came, Jesus passed away.

                          OLIVER
           You re-wrote Jesus' death?

          need and sympathetic to all that he's lost.

                         

                         
          LATER THAT NIGHT: The room is dark, Oliver is asleep. Anna is
          nervously awake. She quietly gets out of bed, puts her pants
          on, and sneaks to the door. Arthur wakes up and hops to her
          wanting to follow.

                          ANNA
           Stay here.
          She starts to close the door, Arthur scratches, she tries
          again, he scratches. She opens the door, Arthur trots out
          into the hallway - Anna catches up with him.

                         

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

          A troubled Anna walks down the hallway with Arthur.

                         

          INT. HOTEL BALLROOM

          A dark empty ballroom, filled with tables. Anna sits in the
          dark and smokes.

                         

          INT. HOTEL ROOM

          Oliver wakes up, slowly figures out that Anna is not in bed.

                          OLIVER
           Anna?

                         

          INT. HOTEL HALLWAY

          Oliver, now in clothes, sleepily looks for Anna.

           10/29/07 66.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          INT. HOTEL BALLROOM

          Oliver enters the ballroom, Arthur trots to him. He see's
          Anna across the room - full of heavy feelings. He sits by
          her.

                          ANNA
           I couldn't sleep, I wanted to walk
           around...
          Oliver's petting Arthur. He's confused and hurt.

                          ANNA
           You've lost so much. What if I
           can't make up for that?

                          OLIVER
           If this is too much, then we should
           just stop.
          Oliver gets up and starts to leave, Anna's surprised. She
          catches up with him puts her arms around him from behind.

                          ANNA
           Wait, wait.
          She forces him to stay there.

                          ANNA
           I don't want to stop.
          They hold this pose in silence for a beat, then,
          surprisingly, he hoists her over his shoulder, and carries
          her back to their room. She laughs, they've made it past this
          trouble.

          BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM BOOOM
          IT IS INCREDIBLY LOUD. Big fireworks explode, the guys laugh
          and HOLLER. Hal raises his arms up in the air in celebration.

                          HAL

                          EVERYONE

          He's still yelling after the explosions stop.
          The guys, all sensing the insanity laugh and yell back at
          him.

                          GUYS

           FFFFFUUUUUCCCCCCKKKKKK!!!!!
          Oliver's laughing now - the noise, the absurdity. Hal and
          Oliver make eye contact. Hal yells less strongly than the
          others but trying...

                          HAL

           FFFFFFUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!!!
          They keep eye contact. They are bonded, happy, out of their
          normal confines. Oliver comes to Hal, yelling again.

          Arthur runs towards camera chasing a tennis ball that Anna
          threw for him. He runs back and jumps onto the bed, waking
          Oliver. He's sleepy, she's happy, wants him to wake up.

                          ANNA
           Ah, you're awake! Arthur says it's
           time to get up, he says he has the
           day off.

                          OLIVER
           He talks to you too?

                          ANNA
           Yeah.

                          OLIVER
           Your English is not so perfect. And
           he said ten minutes.

                         

          INT. MOONLIGHT ROLLER RINK - NIGHT

          Hard cut Oliver and Anna roller-skating to carousel music.
          They're having a great time being terrible at it.
          Oliver and Anna join Elliott and Shauna on the side of the
          rink. Arthur is half hidden in a duffle bag at their feet.

                          OLIVER
           You okay? (to Anna) You did really
           well.

                          ELLIOTT
           Yeah, I can't believe that was your
           first time.

                          OLIVER
           (To Arthur) You watching all the
           humans going around and around.
          The manager of the rink suddenly arrives, upset.

                          MANAGER
           Excuse me. There's no dogs allowed
           in the building. You need to remove
           him from the premises please.

           all control.

                          MANAGER
           I'm sorry. There's no dogs allowed
           in the building.

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, but if I leave him in the
           car, he cries, he howls. I can't
           leave him in the car.

           ELLIOTT AND SHAUNA
           C'mon, it's her first time!

           I don't like it.

                          OLIVER
           She is just talking in French.
           She's saying it's OK, it is such a
           small dog.

                          MANAGER
           You need to remove the dog from the
           premises or I'm going to have to
           call the authorities.

                          OLIVER
           You're gonna call the authorities?

           ELLIOTT AND SHAUNA
           Fuck it, steal the skates, just
           leave.

                          ANNA
           Dans ce pays! On ne peut pas

           Sorry, excuse us, sorry.
          They enter Anna's door.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Oliver, Anna, Arthur enter on their skates. Still very
          playful, they skate around the big room. The phone rings.
          Anna's face falls, they both know it must be her father. She
          muster's on trying to have a good time. Oliver goes and
          unplugs the phone.

                          OLIVER
           He shouldn't do this to you.
          The phone in the next room keeps ringing. He awkwardly skates
          to it and unplugs it. He returns.

                         

                         
          Oliver skates to her concerned.

                          ANNA
           Even if we don't answer, he's still
           in here (points to her head).I go
           somewhere else, he's still here.
          Oliver can relate.

                          OLIVER
           Your leaving soon?

                          ANNA
           Yeah.

                          OLIVER
           I think you should come to my house
           and move in with me.

                          ANNA
           Would you want a strange girl like
           me?

                          OLIVER
           Yeah, a lot.

          She laughs. She almost cries as she thinks this over. She
          skates to him, puts her arms around him.

                          ANNA
           I would love that.
          They kiss.

                          OLIVER
           But now I'm going to have to kill
           you for sure now.

                          ANNA
           Why?

                          OLIVER
           Cause I'm falling in love with you.
          The sound in the room fades down, Oliver's narration fades in
          over the shot of them embracing in their skates.

           We didn't go to this war. We didn't

           Yeah, everyone knows that, here.
          He gives Hal another pill, another reluctant difficult
          swallow, another ping.

                          HAL
           No they don't.

           Everyone knows about that Pop.

           Don't be ridiculous.

          when he asks...

           Did you know, about me?
          Oliver shakes his head no.

           No, I just thought you and mom
           weren't in love.

                          HAL
           We loved each other.

                          OLIVER
           But you were gay that whole time.

                          HAL
           I learned how not to be.

           For 44 years?

                          HAL
           I knew I was gay, though, at dinner
           parties I was looking at the
           husbands not the wives.

           any more treatments.
          Stoic and irreverent, Hal feigns surprise.

                          HAL
           Have I done something wrong?

           DR. FLASTER
           It's best that you stay home.
           Hospice can help you more now, any
           more treatments would just -- cause
           more pain.

                          HAL
           I see.

           DR. LONG
           I'm sorry, I wish we could do more.

                          HAL
           You did an excellent job Dr. Long.
           Thank you... for... For coming to
           the party.
          Oliver's devastated.

          JUMP CUTS: From Hal and Oliver's POV we jump through time as
          two men deliver and set up a hospital bed in Hal's living
          room. And the nurse puts sheets and a blanket on the bed.

                         

          EXT. HAL'S STREET - DAY

          Oliver wheels Hal's chair in outside the house, taking him to
          see a view of the canyons. Hal's face reveals he's finally
          stopped denying the end is near.

                         

          INT. HAL'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Oliver and Hal sit side by side in his new hospital bed, it's
          dark and quite and Oliver has his hand in Hal's.

                          HAL
           You always wanted to hold my hand
           when you were little. I couldn't,
           you know. I was afraid it would
           look funny. I wanted to be close,
           you know and my father certainly
           was never close with me. God, I
           hope I wasn't like that.

                          OLIVER
           I can barely remember you from when
           I was little.

                          HAL
           I guess I was at work.

          INT. MUSEUM OPENING 1978

          Young Oliver walks behind Georgia as she meanders through the
          crowd, feeling alone. She turns and finds Oliver on her tail.
          A fancy woman is talking pretentiously about a painting.
          Georgia's critical and amused, she sidles up to the woman and
          gently places her head on the woman's shoulder.

                          FANCY WOMAN
           Oh!
          Georgia smiles at her, casually unnerving. Oliver pulls her
          away.

                          OLIVER
           Let's go home.
          CUT TO: Oliver and Georgia heading away through the gallery.

                          GEORGIA
           What about your father? What will
           he possibly do without us?

                         

          INT. MUSEUM HALLWAY

          As they're making their way out of the museum an formal older
          lady stops them.

                          OLDER WOMAN
           Georgia? You leaving?

                          GEORGIA
           Yes Mary, it's an emergency,
           Oliver's appendix has ruptured.

                          OLDER WOMAN
           Oh dear.
          They look at Oliver who's mortified.

                          GEORGIA
           He's a very composed child.

                          OLIVER
           Let's go.
          Oliver pulls her away before she starts any more trouble.

           Aha. The infamous left.
          Up a new street, they arrive at the next stop.

                          GEORGIA
           And?
          Oliver points left.

                          GEORGIA
           Left again. Going in circles. I
           like it.
          Irreverent but heavy, they drive on.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S CHILDHOOD HOME

          Oliver and Georgia enter. She heads down the hallway to her

           We knew it wouldn't work even

          Oliver hands Arthur, a dog bed, and a bag of dog food to
          Elliott.

                          OLIVER
           Hey.

                          ELLIOTT
           Hey.

                          OLIVER

                          (TO ARTHUR)
           You're going to take care of
           Elliott. I'll be back in a couple
           of days.

                          (TO ELLIOT)
           Good luck.

                          ELLIOTT
           Alright.

                          OLIVER
           Okay? Thanks.
          Elliott closes the door. Oliver heads back to his car and
          Arthur's howling begins. It's an incredibly sad and desperate
          howl. Oliver gets to his car, the howling doesn't stop,
          Oliver can't ignore it. Oliver get's out of the car, heads
          back to house to get Arthur.

          Oliver now with a bouquet of flowers in his hand, looking for

          he has doubts about the flowers, he decides to throw them
          away.
          Oliver rings her buzzer, no answers, a stranger leaves the
          building and he catches the door before it close, he enters.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S DOOR

          Oliver makes it to her door, he knocks, there's no answer. He

          INTERCUT BETWEEN THEM:

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Hey.

           Hey. Look I'm so sorry... But I'm,
           I'm at your front door. I'm in New
           York.
          Anna, still in bed, sits up and feels something.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           I'm in Los Angeles.
          Oliver's flabbergasted she's not behind the door.

           You said you were coming here?!

                          ANNA
           Yeah, but I didn't leave.

                          OLIVER
           Fuck. I'm in your building.
          Anna laughs.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Okay. See the window? Near the
           radiator?
          Oliver looks around and sees the radiator - goes to look.

                          ANNA
           There is a hide-a-key behind it.

                         

          INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT.

          The door opens, Oliver tentatively enters the empty room.
          The apartment is very spare, barely lived in. A lone couch,
          clothes on a rack, a few personal photos taped to the wall.

                          OLIVER
           Okay, I'm inside. Wow, there's like
           nothing here.

                          ANNA
           No.
          Oliver moves forward into the kitchen.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           This is my kitchen. It's where I
           eat.
          Oliver follows her tour, while she's not there, it's
          strangely intimate.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           This is my bathroom. It's very
           fancy.
          The bare, poor bathroom is not fancy.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           Outside my window...

           ANNA (V.O.)
           ... That's my neighbor's roof. The
           room at the end is my bedroom...

                         

          INT. ANNA'S BEDROOM

          Oliver enters her bedroom.

           ANNA (V.O.)
           That's my closet. Those are my
           clothes and my pictures.
          There is a single rack holding up some clothes. Her pictures
          are taped to the wall. Oliver sits on her bed.

                          ANNA
           Why do you leave everyone? Why did
           you let me go?

          some gesture of hopelessness.

          WE HEAR OLIVER'S ANSWER OVER THIS IMAGE:

           OLIVER (V.O.)
           Maybe because I, I don't really
           believe that it's gonna work. And
           then I make sure it doesn't work.

          love and affection. Oliver watches from the kitchen door.

           Isn't Juan's hair wonderful.

           Oh, no.

                          JUAN
           Just a little bit?

                          HAL
           I don't think so.

                          JUAN
           Come on. Just try a little bit.
           It'll be fun.

                          HAL

                          (LAUGHS)
           Yeah?

                          JUAN
           Yeah.

                          HAL
           How do you do it?

                          JUAN
           Okay, I'm going to show you how.
          Juan steps away and grabs his mousse, puts a little in his
          hand and sits back down on Hal's bed. He begins to spread
          it gently through wisps of Hal's white hair. Oliver watches
          Hal close his eyes, and deeply enjoy this simple affection
          and camaraderie with another gay man.

                          JUAN
           There.

                          HAL
           Is that it?
          Hal looks into camera which is Oliver's POV.

                          HAL
           How do I look?
          Oliver's filled with love, happiness, regret.

          gather around his hospital bed as Hal's gay priest gives him
          his Last Rites - Oliver and Juan watch in disbelief in the
          background.

                         

          INT. HAL'S KITCHEN - LATER

          Oliver's alone in the kitchen, his head on the table -
          asleep. Juan walks to him and wakes him.

                          JUAN
           Oliver. He's gone.
          Oliver gets up. He can now see to the hospital bed, Hal's
          lifeless profile. Oliver is lost.
          Oliver goes to Hal, puts his head on his chest and cries.

           her arm giving me the daisies,
           saying, here, here's simple and
           happy. That's what I meant to give
           you.

                         

          EXT. ANDY'S HOUSE - DAY

          Oliver arrives at Andy's door. Andy answers, Arthur's jumps
          up to see Oliver.

                          OLIVER
           Hey.

          Oliver stops and looks back.

                          OLIVER
           What?

                          ANDY
           You never called or came to see me?
          Oliver falters, not know how to say it, then...

                          OLIVER
           No. No, it's because my father
           loved you so much.
          This hits Andy hard. Oliver turns to leave but can't. He
          turns back, goes to Andy and they hug.

                         

          INT. OLIVER'S BEDROOM

          Oliver and Arthur arrive, happy and relieved, Oliver jumps on
          his bed and Arthur follows.

          She's a bit tentative, but she's here and happy.

                          OLIVER

          Arthur runs up and Anna bends down to greet him. They missed
          each other.
          Anna walks in and Oliver follows.

          Oliver laughs nervously. In the dining room, Hal's old boxes
          are still stacked along the walls. Oliver leans forward and
          pulls something out of a box.
          She looks at a personal ad application, with the picture of
          Hal in the open jean jacket we saw at the beginning of the
          film.

                          ANNA
           Oh. Crazy picture...

                          OLIVER

           I'm looking for sex with the hope
           it turns into friendship or a

          We see REPEAT SHOTS of Hal, and in every shot he's looking at
          camera. Hal telling Oliver he's gay, Hal napping with Andy
          and waving at Oliver, Hal after Juan put in his hair mousse
          looking at Oliver, Hal showing Oliver his radiation tatoo...

           I like giving and getting rubdowns
           and then going into mutual soft
           stuff.
          They both smile.

"... and as he stared at the sky and listened to a cow
mooing almost dreamily in a distant village, he tried to
understand what it all meant -- the sky, and the fields,
and the humming telegraph pole; he felt that he was just
at the point of understanding it when his head started to
spin and the lucid languor of the moment became
intolerable..."

                       Vladimir Nabokov

In this script there are six main characters who inhabit
different periods of time, from pre-history to the
present day. But there is just one story. Because we
blend into one developing narrative the lives that we
show.

There is no suggestion of time travel or re-incarnation
or any other tricksy or mystic device. We can do in real
time and with real characters what other movies strive to
do with immortal time travellers and ghosts. Our story
is thoroughly based in reality and the magic we are
dealing with is real, human magic.
In moving from one character to the next everything will
change; supporting characters, setting, period. But the
essential situation of our hero of the moment will relate
to the one before and the one following.
The magic will be in the transitions, in leaving one
character and advancing the film through hundreds or
thousands of years to find our next hero in tantalizingly
similar human circumstances. The effect of these transi-
tions across space and time, will let the audience grasp
the simple truth behind our story; that we are all in it
together.
The key to allowing the audience to enjoy this human
connection at the heart of the film is that one actor
will play the six individuals. The feeling will be of
the endless, glorious playing and replaying of the simple
drama of being alive.
We end the film with a present-day hero, but by that time
we will be seeing this modern man in an entirely fresh
light, feeling his kinship with the caveman and the slave
and the others who have gone before. The resolution of
his contemporary story is theirs also. By then perhaps,
we will be able to see ourselves in this novel perspec-
tive, too.

And the structure of the film itself has the thrill of
novelty. It has never before been used in cinema.
Never. Our six characters and their stories connect in
many different ways, some obvious, others vague, tanta-
lizing threads. Even global connections are made, as the
planet itself and all its people, come and go in the
story. For the audience the game of making the connec-
tions, feeling the bonds, even inventing or discovering
associations of their own, will be endless in this big-
gest of stories, smallest of stories. It is truly a new
cinematic experience.                                       *

                             BEING HUMAN
      Hector is a family man. He and his woman and two
      children live near the ocean in a sheltered fold on a
      hillside, a shallow cave given protection at its entrance
      by a covering of branches and brush. Just inside a small
      fire smoulders permanently, a few times a day encouraged
      into life for cooking or warmth. If it ever went out it
      would be a catastrophe, so it remains a smouldering com-
      fort and a constant preoccupation for the whole family.
      Hector doesn't know that his name is Hector. It is
      simply a convenience to help us tell his story. The idea
      of individual names is an imaginative leap that has not
      yet been made by mankind when we first meet him. Hector
      is living out his life 4000 years before the birth of
      Christ, in a reasonably temperate zone of the planet. In
      his entire life Hector will traverse no more than ten
      square miles of it.


      FADE IN:
      FIRST IMAGE
      is the reflection of Hector's face in a rock pool. The
      image suddenly fragments. Hector is enjoying himself,
      deflecting his stream of pee now and then so that his
      image reforms itself and then is disrupted again. When
      he is finished, a trace of vanity makes him bend down
      closer to his reflection. He strokes his long hair and
      fingers a blemish on his cheek.
      Then he is aware of another presence. He sharply turns.
      Some way off a solitary figure stands on the rise of some
      rocks, not afraid to show itself. Hector calls out.
                               HECTOR
                 Go back home... leave me alone...

      We see that the figure is a young BOY, Hector's son.     The
      Boy thinks about it for a moment, before turning and
      disappearing behind the rocks.

1-4   TITLE SCENES                                               1-4

      The small fire that never goes out has been enlarged to
      cook the day's meal. Beyond the fire on a rock shelf
      HECTOR plays with his children, a GIRL of six and Boy of
      eight. It is the usual rough romp that fathers indulge
      in, but in 4000 BC possibly rougher than normal. Hector
      is acting the part of some trapped wild animal, lashing
      out at the hunters surrounding him. But in his act of
      wild rage he gets carried away. He picks up his son and
      throws him hard, much too hard, on his back.

      The Boy tumbles down   from the shelf to the cave floor at
      his mother, DEIRDRE's   feet, howling in pain. Deidre
      scowls at Hector. If    the gesture had been invented he
      would probably shrug   his shoulders. The Boy howls on.
      Hector kneels beside his daughter, absorbed in her antics
      as she sleeps. She is a vivid dreamer. Her whole little
      form wriggles and contorts in response to the fantasy
      unspooling in her head. She emits unearthly nighttime
      noises, squeals and giggles and moans. Hector is fasci-
      nated. Where has his daughter gone? Who is this strange
      wild creature that has taken her form, lying beside him?
      Hector's daughter delights him. And while Hector watches
      his daughter, Deirdre from their bed watches Hector.

      It is almost dawn, the cave is quiet and the fire has
      diminished. By its light we see Deirdre and Hector making
      love, on their bed of dried grass and skins. It's diffi-
      cult to say what their lovemaking might look like. What
      has 6000 years done to that art? We will think about it.
      On the far side of the cave we see the sleeping children.
      As we MOVE CLOSER we see that they are far from sleep.
      Two sets of bright eyes peek out from under their cover.
      We CUT BETWEEN them, the loving parents and the watching,
      learning children.
      Hector is arguing with his son, just outside their cave.
      The Boy wants to go foraging with him again.

                                 HECTOR
                   No... stay here... stay!
      Hector takes a few steps.    The Boy follows.

                                 HECTOR
                   No... go back... go away...

      Hector walks on again, taking big, angry father strides.
      The Boy stubbornly tags along at a safe distance. Hector
      walks on for some time before turning on him.

                                 HECTOR
                   Leave me alone! Stay here...
                   Stay!

      There is real anger in his voice. The Boy wisely
      retreats to the cave. As Hector turns to continue his
      walk alone he see Deirdre looking at him accusingly from
      the entrance. She holds out her arms ready to comfort
      the Boy rejected by his father. Hector is in the
      classic, timeless, no-win situation and he knows it.
      With a sigh of frustration he heads for the beach.

                                                          3.         *

5   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             5
    Hector is foraging on the shoreline, gathering cockles,
    seaweeds, mussels, crabs, anything edible. He splashes
    in the shallows, hoarding the food in a roughly-woven
    bag. Every now and then he will suck a cockle from its
    shell or crunch on a particularly tasty piece of seaweed.
    Hector looks about 30 years old. This is advanced middle
    age for his times and it shows. He has a heavy cold and
    an irritating hack in his throat. In a similar condition
    a modern individual would spend two or three pleasantly
    drugged days in bed, perhaps attempting a little light
    paperwork propped up on some pillows.

    The sun is warming the day. Hector sits on a rock, sur-
    veying his world. He seems very much a part of it. He
    watches some wading seabirds nearby. Like him they are
    nosing around the margins of low tide for food. He
    smiles. In another season they or their eggs will pro-
    vide a meal or two. There is a strange atmosphere of
    appropriateness in the scene, Hector seems such an inte-
    gral part of it. The easy fit of the man in his land-
    scape strikes us. Hector belongs to it in ways that a
    present-day hunter or holiday maker, or even naturalist,
    never could. Also, there is an odd sense of the world
    being rather empty.
    Whether the larger world is round or flat,   spinning or
    orbiting, Hector neither knows nor cares.    He knows
    simple things. Cold and hunger. He knows     warmth, rough
    comfort and companionship. His family and    the safety of
    their cave.
    Further along the shore Hector drops his bag and straigh-
    tens himself, easing the ache in his back. Then some-
    thing disturbs him. From behind a distant headland a
    smudge of smoke trails into the sky. Hector picks up his
    bag and runs. He knows where he is going. He reaches a
    vantage point on some rocks. He steadies himself and
    gazes hard out to sea. We can feel the strain in his
    eyes as he tries to detect any hint of threat in the
    glinting water. Then his jaw drops in fear. Around the
    edge of the headland two dark shapes proceed in regular
    motion. Their steady progress is full of menace. Oar-
    driven boats, slowly, insistently making their way into
    Hector's bay. He jumps from the rocks and runs up the
    beach toward the cave. One thing else that Hector knows
    is fear, blind, gut-turning fear.

6   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          6

    Hector is a small figure in the landscape now, racing up
    the steep slope in the direction of his home.

    He stops for breath and to look back on the bay. The
    shapes are distinct now, two large open boats, roughly
    made but menacingly adequate for their purpose, coastal
    raiding. The boats are nearing the beach now and figures
    can be seen preparing to land. Hector gathers enough of
    his wits and strength to continue his race up the
    hillside.

7   INT. HECTOR'S CAVE - DAY                                     7

    Inside, his family are in a state of panic. They seem to
    have prepared for this moment. Through their agitation
    there is purpose. They gather bits and pieces to carry
    with them in their flight. Hector's children are attemp-
    ting to take too much. Hector shouts instructions to
    them as he puts more wood on the fire. It must stay
    burning in their absence.
    Hector gathers his family together and they leave the
    cave.


8   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                          8
    Hector shoves his children in one direction up the slope
    further into the hills. His woman runs off the other
    way. A hasty, confused argument takes place.

                                 HECTOR
                 Up the hill!
                               DEIRDRE
                 No, down onto the other beach.
                 The little ones can't take the
                 hill. Neither can I.

                              HECTOR
                 Up the hill! They're down there
                 already. I saw them!

                                 DEIRDRE
                 You're wrong!
    She runs off down the slope. Hector has no choice but to
    follow her, herding the children in front of him.

    Deirdre runs on, heading for the lower slope and the cover
    of some trees. Then from these same trees she sees the
    figures of the RAIDERS coming toward her. She turns,
    running back up the hill. Hector and the children also
    turn and run back the way they have come, by now dropping
    precious bits of food and other possessions. The Raiders
    are running strongly, five or six of them.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                          5.         *

     The little Girl starts to go back for a precious toy she
     has dropped. Hector picks her up and carries her off
     over his shoulder. The Boy follows.
     Deirdre is trailing behind them. She was right. She
     doesn't have the stamina for the hill. Hector looks back
     and sees the Raiders gaining on her. His face is a con-
     fusion of fear and indecision. He almost stops, as if to
     go back and help her, but then changes his mind and runs
     off once again with the children. Deirdre is by now
     throwing the things she is carrying at her pursuers,
     hoping that they will stop to retrieve them and allow her
     to gain some ground. But they don't stop and the effort
     tires her even more.

     She attempts one final dash and then, all of her energy
     gone, she stops in her tracks and waits for her pursuers.
     the Raiders break their run also and trot and finally
     walk, the distance between them and Deirdre.
     Hector is watching all of this over his shoulder, still
     running. He stops for a moment to watch Deirdre being
     finally surrounded by the Raiders. Then he runs on.


9    EXT. VALLEY - DAY                                          9
     Hector is tiring, too. With the Girl still awkwardly
     clinging to his neck he is picking his way up a steep
     slope, half-dragging the Boy up behind him. He stops
     for a breath and sees the raiders moving into the
     valley below. In a moment of utter panic he lets go of
     his son, drops the Girl from his shoulder, and runs on
     alone. We can sense the moment of release in his
     unburdened flight. But it doesn't last long. Some way
     up the slope he stops and turns. He sees his children,
     only now beginning to work out what has happened, and
     the raiders below. He can't do it. Even as the Girl
     calls to him he is running back down the hill, feeling
     the first stab of a guilt that will never leave him.

                                GIRL
                  Come back, Dada...

10   EXT. VALLEY - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                          10

     Hector and the children have reached the safety of a
     small valley higher up in the hills. The raiders have
     been slowed down by their capture of Deirdre. Hector
     is hoisting his two children into the lower branches of
     a solitary tree on the hillside. He coaxes them up into
     the higher branches.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                BOY
                  I'm hungry.

                                HECTOR
                  Don't move from here. I'll come
                  for you in the morning. There's
                  no food. Try and sleep in the
                  branches. Don't cry. Don't make
                  a noise.
     Hector moves off, looking back to his children in the
     tree.  They too gaze anxiously at him. They don't wave.
     Maybe waving hasn't been invented yet. Hector heads off
     alone, higher into the hills.


11   EXT. ROCKS - DUSK                                          11
     It is dusk now. We find Hector waking from a fitful
     sleep behind some rocks. He sits up and takes in his
     surroundings. His face hardens as awareness of his pre-
     dicament returns. He stands up and then crouching low,
     moves off down the hill.


12   EXT. VALLEY - DUSK                                         12
     Hector has returned to the area of the tree. He slows
     down some distance away and just in time. He sees a
     figure standing beneath the tree. He moves forward to
     the protection of some rocks, and watches. He is close
     enough to hear the voice of the solitary Raider, although
     he doesn't understand the words. The Raider looks up
     into the branches and talks in a friendly, persuasive
     way.
                                RAIDER
                  It's too cold to spend all night
                  up there. We've got a fire at the
                  beach. Food, too.

     There is no response from the tree.    The Raider coaxes
     again.
                                RAIDER
                  Come on! Your mother's down
                  there. She's happy... she's warm,
                  too... and full... she wants to
                  see you... she sent me...

     His friendly tone of voice has an effect. There is
     movement in the branches. Hector can see the dark shapes
     of his two children clambering down. The Raider
     stretches out his arms and helps the Boy to the ground.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                         7.

12   CONTINUED:                                                12
     Then he reaches up for the Girl, catches her as she drops
     and keeps her in his arms. He laughs in a comforting
     way.
                                RAIDER
                  That was easy, eh? You're half
                  asleep already, little girl. I'll
                  carry you.
     Hector watches the Raider and his children move slowly
     off, down the hillside, the Raider carrying the Girl in
     one arm and holding the Boy's hand. They almost look
     like a family.

13   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                        13

     It is fully dark now. On the beach the Raiders have set
     up a comfortable camp with a large fire. We are still
     with Hector. He has come down from his bleak hiding
     place in the hills. The smell of fire and food and con-
     cern for his family, have drawn him here. He is hiding
     somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to
     observe it.
     What he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. His
     family appear to be happily integrated with the Raiders.
     His two children have become fast friends with the man
     who coaxed them from the tree. His woman is with a
     larger group closer to the fire. They are playfully
     attempting to communicate with her, and although still a
     little timid, she is smiling. There is no hint of bar-         *
     barity, rape or abuse. That was not the intention of the
     Raiders. To them, a fertile woman and two healthy
     children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages.
     For their part, the family have to accept the situation.
     Food and shelter are the best that life can offer.

     Painfully, Hector takes in the reality of the scene. His
     family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. In
     the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the
     headland forever. He watches them for a while longer,
     then it becomes too painful. He retreats into the dark-
     ness and up into the empty hills again.


14   EXT. ROCK SHELTER - NIGHT                                 14
     Hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a
     narrow crevice in the rocks. He doesn't sleep, or even
     attempt to close his eyes. He stares into the darkness.
     There is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi-
     losophy or religion, no friend to run to. This night he
     is utterly alone.

                                                         8.

15   EXT. ROCKS - MORNING                                       15
     In the morning it is lightly raining. Hector stands in
     the drizzle outside the shelter. It seems to revive him,
     refresh him, even comfort him. A sign, however meager,
     that life goes on. Then Hector trots off in the direc-
     tion of the shore. There is not much else that he can
     do.


16   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                           16
     The Raiders are loading up their boats, wading back and
     forth from the shoreline. Hector watches from cover.
     His family are already on one of the boats, awaiting            *
     whatever lies ahead, too afraid to betray real emotion.         *

     The last of the Raiders on shore wade out the short dis-
     tance to the boats. Hector watches these moments of
     departure, watches the faces of his family.
     Hector makes his move. In a mad act he breaks cover and         *
     runs down toward the departing boats. The last Raiders
     are climbing aboard. Hector charges at full speed to the
     water's edge. He screams agonizingly at the Raiders and
     impotently starts throwing stones at them. The Raiders
     all look at him. The LEADER is impudently brushing
     Hector's missiles aside, like so many flies and smiling.
     Suddenly Hector's rage and energy leave him. He stands
     looking at the Raiders and they look at him, for a long
     moment. The Raiders are all young men, hardly into their
     twenties, and nowadays might resemble something like a          *
     motorcycle gang. But in Hector's time they are men in
     the full prime of life. They begin to laugh and exchange
     remarks about Hector. He returns their looks fiercely.
     His woman and children sit on the boat, frozen in fear.         *
     The Leader eventually turns from Hector, still smiling
     and gives an order. The men lift their oars and prepare
     to leave. Then an older man stands up in the other boat.
     He calls over to the Leader, nodding in the direction of
     Hector. Hector doesn't know what they are saying, but
     they have an intense exchange, obviously centered on him.
     The older man seems to be an adviser, a priest or wise
     man, although he's still only about thirty years old.
     The Leader listens to him intently. The PRIEST talks and
     points to the cliffs. The Leader looks there and nods
     his head. He gives some instructions to his men. Hector
     stands, bemused. Six or so of the Raiders leave the
     boats, wade ashore and without any resistance from him,
     take hold of Hector. Hector's children instictively rise        *
     as if to defend their father, but Deirdre, despite her          *
     own feelings, wisely holds them back.                           *

                                                              9.

17   EXT. CLIFFS - DAY                                             17
     Hector's hands have been bound with rope. He is being
     led up to the top of the cliffs. The Priest and the
     Leader walk on ahead, still talking intensely.
     At the top of the cliff the bay and the boats and the
     wide sea are stretched out beneath them. The Priest, as
     they arrive, becomes excited. He points to a pile of
     large stones at the very summit of the headland. The
     mound of stones is obviously man-made.
                            PRIEST
               I told you! I knew they did it
               around here! Ask him...
     The Leader moves closer to Hector and talks to him in a
     friendly, reasoning tone.

                             LEADER
               What do we do? Do we throw you
               over, is that the idea?
     Hector doesn't understand.    He looks at him blankly.
                             LEADER
               He wants me to throw you over.
               What does it do? Does it help the
               sun? Should I throw you over?
     The Leader tries to help Hector understand by miming the
     act of throwing him off the cliff. Hector doesn't know
     how to respond.
                             PRIEST
               I tell you, it's one man, one
               stone. It'll help the voyage.
     The Leader is unsure. He walks around the pile of
     stones, checking it out from all sides as if it was some
     infernal machine that he didn't know the workings of. He
     squats down and squints through it to the watery sun
     emerging from the clouds far out to sea. He looks across
     to Hector, now sitting on the grass. The Leader sits
     down beside him. They sit together like friends. The
     ageless intimacy of sacrificer and victim.

                             LEADER
               What's it got to do with the sun?
                             PRIEST
               I don't know, yet.

     The Leader looks at Hector.    Then he makes up his mind.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                              10.

17   CONTINUED:                                                     17
                                LEADER
                  No.  It's too much of a risk.
                  Just add a stone to the pile. Let
                  him go. That's the best we can
                  do.  Let's go.

     With that, he stands up. The Priest, with some       sense of
     ceremony, looks around for a large stone, picks      one up
     and places it on top of the pile. He waits for       a moment,
     almost as if he expects some consequence of his      action.

                                PRIEST
                  It's meaningless, without him
                  going over the cliff.

     The Leader strides off back toward the beach. The others
     follow him, giving a final look or smile to Hector, apart
     from the Priest, who looks him up and down, regretting
     that he is not by now a corpse in the ocean. Hector
     watches them go, too shocked still to react in any mean-
     ingful way. He stands alone, trying to unpick the rope
     that binds his hands.
     When they are some distance from him, Hector starts to
     follow them, at first running to catch up and then simply
     trotting after them. The Raiders are aware of him behind
     them. The Leader eventually stops and calls to Hector.
                                 LEADER
                  Off you go.   We don't want you.
     He turns from Hector   and moves on. Hector persists in
     following them. They    are his only connection now with
     anything that thinks   or feels in the world. His link
     with them is all that   is left. Again and again the
     Leader stops to shoo   Hector away, but Hector dumbly tags
     along behind.

18   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               18

     The Raiders wade out to the waiting boats. Hector
     follows to the very water's edge, then stands and bleakly
     watches them. The Raiders prepare to move off. Hector
     is an embarrassment to them now. At the last moment the
     Leader gives a brusque order to one of his men. The man
     clambers out of the boat and wades ashore again,
     carrying a large flint-bladed knife. He comes out of the
     water and walks up to Hector. Hector is beyond any form
     of reaction. He will take whatever is offered to him.
     The man comes close, the knife held ready. He stands in
     front of Hector for a moment. On the boat, Hector's
     family are tense with fear for his life.

     Then the tense moment passes, as the man grunts and nods
     at Hector's hands, still bound with rope. Hector under-
     stands. He lifts his hands and the man with some effort
     hacks through the rough hemp. Then he turns and wades
     back to the boat.

     As the man clambers aboard the Leader speaks to him. The
     man stops, drops back into the water, and returns to
     Hector on the shore. He offers Hector the cut piece of
     rope, a weird gesture of conciliation. He even smiles.
     Hector refuses the gift. The man stands sheepishly for a
     moment, then drops the rope at Hector's feet and wades
     back to the boat. A piece of rope in exchange for a
     family.

     Hector watches them for some time, his family and the
     strange Raiders, as they, achingly slowly, retreat from
     his view and his life.
     At last he turns and moves up from the shoreline. He
     goes some distance then stops, thinks for a moment, then
     retraces his steps. He goes back to the water's edge,
     picks up the piece of rope that bound him, and walks
     off with it. It might be of some use to him.


19   INT. CAVE - DAY                                            19
     Hector has returned to his cave home, now cold and empty
     of life. He is working on his instincts now, still
     emotionally in shock. He digs around in the embers of
     the fire. Some of the larger bits of wood still hold
     some life. Hector bends low and starts to waft expertly         *
     and blow at the fire's remains.
     We leave our first Hector squatting at his fire, in the
     simplest act of physical survival. For him the problems
     of emotional survival without his family lie ahead.

20   INT. BATHHOUSE FURNACE - DAY                               20

     This is another, bigger fire. In fact we might be in
     hell. A crude furnace blazes. Filthy, sweat-covered
     men feed it with wood and charcoal, an endless task given
     the ferocity of the fire. To one side of the oppressive,
     low-ceilinged furnace room, some small boys endlessly
     toil at two large bellows, feeding the flames with jets
     of air. OVER the NOISE of the FURNACE someone is
     WHISTLING, an odd human sound in an inhuman setting.
     Shadowy figures come and go with barrow loads of wood.
     We TILT UP TO the space above the furnace to see a mass
     of dangerously crude clay pipes, oozing water and steam
     at every joint.

                                                         12.

21   INT. BATHHOUSE - DAY                                      21
     Above the heat and filth there is a different world. A
     clean, beautifully tiled world of lazing figures, droning
     conversations and resonant laughter. It is the hot room
     of a bathhouse somewhere in the Roman Empire. We have
     advanced 4000 years into the future and it shows in the
     technology. It is men's day at the bathhouse. All of
     the people relaxing in the water look prosperous and
     comfortable with themselves. Slaves wait in attendance,
     some around the edge of the pool, others in the water
     rubbing backs and massaging shoulders. There are three
     or four times as many slaves as bathers, and the proprie-
     torial way that they look after their masters gives the
     place the odd atmosphere of a kindergarten for over-
     indulged grown-ups.

     And then we find our Hector. He stands against the wall,
     holding a large towel. Although clean-shaven and more
     healthy-looking we can still recognize Hector, more so         *
     by the look in his eyes. There is a set to his face
     that tells us he is a man alone, emotionally detached
     from his surroundings. He is a personal body slave. He
     watches his master in the pool, alert to any hint of need
     that he might have.

     Hector's master LUCINNIUS is not as relaxed as the others
     around him. He is in anxious conversation with an older        *
     man wading beside him. We don't hear what they are saying
     but there is enough body language to detect Lucinnius'
     pleading and the older man's cool distraction. The older
     man gives a final dismissive shake of his head. Hector         *
     immediately moves to the side of the pool with the towel as
     Lucinnius climbs out of the water.
                             LUCINNIUS
               I'm going to the cool room.


22   INT. BATHHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                      22   *
     Hector wraps the towel around his master and follows him,
     a look of concern on his face. Lucinnius' worries are
     Hector's also.
     Hector walks a pace behind Lucinnius through various
     chambers of the bathhouse, passing the games area and
     the massage room as they go. All around them slaves
     attend to their pampered masters.

23   INT. BATHHOUSE - COOL ROOM - DAY                          23   *

     After an anxious scan of the cool room, Lucinnius goes
     towards three men occupying a marble bench.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                            13.

23   CONTINUED:                                                   23
     Hector as if by magic produces a small wooden stool for
     his master to sit on as he joins the others. Hector then
     moves out of earshot, but still alert to his master's
     behavior. Lucinnius is nervous as he attempts to
     casually join his friends. The eldest of the three
     gives off as much of the aura of a Godfather as a naked
     man in a towel can. The other two are deferential to
     the older man, and treat Lucinnius with apparent con-
     tempt. Hector watches the older man put a paternal
     hand on Luccinius's shoulder and speak with a calm
     smile on his face. Hector almost winces to see his
     master submit to this patronizing treatment. Slave
     and master exist so closely together that many of
     their feelings are shared. More precisely, Lucinnius's
     feelings are shared by Hector. It is a one-way exchange.
     From morning until night, and probably in his dreams too,
     Hector is living two lives, his own and his master's.
     Here in ancient Rome is this what they call classic
     schizophrenia?
     As Luccinius stands to leave we can    tell by their expres-
     sions that the THREE MEN are open in    their contempt for
     him. Hector is quickly on his feet     and by Lucinnius's
     side as he goes. A final sarcastic     remark comes from one
     of the three.
                                MAN #1
                  Well washed, Lucinnius.

     Lucinnius tries to muster his dignity as they leave.              *

24   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            24

     This is not the grandeur of Rome, but the dusty main
     street of a provincial capital in Greece or Spain or
     North Africa. It is difficult to tell from the people
     because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from
     every corner of the Mediterranean world. It has some-
     thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western,
     except that here the half-finished buildings are made of
     brick and stone.
     Lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. Hector follows three
     paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the
     scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. The stool goes
     with them everywhere, in case Lucinnius has to stop in
     the street and converse with a friend. Other notables
     are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging
     along behind with their little wooden stools. Some have
     whole trains of slaves shadowing them. Human status
     symbols. Lucinnius stops near some street stalls.
     Hector stops beside him.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           14.        *

24   CONTINUED:                                                  24
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Bad omens, Hector. Bad omens.
                  Get me something to eat. Just
                  a mouse or two.
                               HECTOR
                  Yes.

     Hector places the stool at Lucinnius's feet and moves off.
     Lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius as he orders the food.
                                HECTOR
                  Two mice... and some bread...

                               STALLHOLDER
                  No mice.
                                HECTOR
                  Two chicken legs, then, cold, and
                  the bread.
     As Hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees
     another man, JULIAN, approach Lucinnius, trailed by TWO
     SLAVES. One of them is carrying a folding chair much
     more substantial than Lucinnius's. Julian and Lucinnius
     greet one another and sit down to talk, Lucinnius at
     something of a height disadvantage. The Two Slaves move
     off to one side. Lucinnius's mood has brightened since
     the arrival of his friend. Their conversation seems open
     and friendly.
     Hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join
     the Two Slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as
     he goes.

                                JULIAN
                  Of course you're free to call at my
                  house at anytime, but I was
                  receiving Nepos... how could I
                  admit you?
     Hector offers to share his bread with the other Two
     Slaves. They easily fall into conversation, inevitably,
     about their masters.

                                SLAVE #1
                  Spoiled his day, meeting your man...
                  he's been avoiding him all week.

                                SLAVE #2
                  His ships have gone too, we heard.

     This is news to Hector.

                                HECTOR
                  When did you hear?
                                SLAVE #2
                  Last night. Nepos knew. Pirates.
                  They're sunk, he reckons. That
                  could finish him, eh?
                                HECTOR
                  This is the worst it's been.                           *
                                SLAVE #1
                  You'll be up for sale before you
                  know it!

     This makes them laugh, Hector less so than the other
     two.
                                HECTOR
                  He's finished... you reckon?
     The other two nod their heads.
                                SLAVE #1
                  Yes... at the baths... I could
                  tell... they smelled blood...

                                HECTOR
                  Well... if he'd pulled it off he'd
                  be in Rome by now...
                                SLAVE #1
                  And you with him...
     Hector nods his head thoughtfully.

                                HECTOR
                  And me with him... half way home...

     Lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final
     words, unaware of the scrutiny they have been under, or
     so used to it that they are oblivious to it. Hector
     and the Slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their          *
     positions behind their masters. The casualness of their
     conversation has gone, and they resume the formality of
     their roles.

25   EXT. STREET - DAY                                              25

     Lucinnius is eager to talk, and tosses his words over his
     shoulder to Hector.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  He's a true friend, probably the
                  only one I have left.
     Hector obligingly trots a step or two closer to Lucinnius
     to aid their conversation.

                                HECTOR
                  Will he lend you the money?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  He was honest about it. He said
                  so, plain and simple. No.
                                HECTOR
                  That's a problem.

     Lucinnius unburdens himself.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  And the ships have gone... did I
                  tell you that?
                               HECTOR
                  Have they?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Cyprian knows already. He'll
                  want his money back too...
     We can see the concentration on Hector's face as he
     concocts appropriate responses.
     He has a tough occupation, being the alter ego to an
     ambitious loser in one of the most competitive and
     dangerous societies ever to exist. And he has to carry
     the stool and the towel as well.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  When we get home I want you to get
                  some chickens... and fetch Hermas,
                  the diviner.
                               HECTOR
                  Yes.

26   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               26
     At home, we find Lucinnius and Hector with the diviner
     HERMAS. They are gathered around a shrine in the large
     public room. The entrails of a chicken lie on a slab of
     marble. Hermas prods them with a knife. He makes much
     of the mysteries of his craft, as if it were a skill
     beyond ordinary men.

     The other two peer over his shoulders. Suitably mysti-
     fied, Lucinnius talks in a reverent low voice.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Are my ships from Sicily still
                  afloat...?

     Hermas tetchily stops him.
                                HERMAS
                  No, no... offer the grain first...
                  sprinkle it on the altar...
     Lucinnius obeys.

                                HERMAS
                  ... and we can't ask the Gods
                  specific questions like that...
                  it's a gentle, probing enquiry...
                  general questions... but let's
                  see.
     He cuts into the chicken liver and prods around the in-
     side. The other two wait in silence.
                                HERMAS
                  General answer... no...
                                                                     *
                                LUCINNIUS
                  What do you mean?
                                 HERMAS
                  I mean, no.   The liver says no...

     Lucinnius objects.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it again... I want you to do it
                  again... Is it the Gods' will...                   *
                  that Cyprian... be well disposed                   *
                  towards me... in the future?                       *

                                HERMAS
                  If you want to do it  again, you
                  need another chicken  and another
                  fifteen sesterces...  and I'd like
                  the first fifteen now  please.
     Hector looks a Lucinnius, who nods reluctantly. Hector
     opens his purse and counts out the coins for Hermas.

     Hector is giving Lucinnius a soothing shoulder massage.

     Lucinnius is still in a talking mood.   His troubles
     won't allow him to relax.
                             LUCINNIUS

               finished. Just when things were

               too, Hector... in four or five
               years I was going to make you a
               free man... and then in ten years                       *
               you'd be a citizen... you... you                        *
               could've found your family...
               brought them here... everything...

     Hector smiles ruefully.
                             HECTOR
               It sounds good.
     Lucinnius misses the irony in Hector's voice and enthuses
     about his own future generosity.
                             LUCINNIUS
               It does, doesn't it!
     Lucinnius is silent for a while as Hector continues to            *
     rub his shoulders.
                             LUCINNIUS
               I shouldn't give up. I can't...
               I'll visit Cyprian, first thing
               tomorrow... before the others can
               get to him... he's got to see
               reason... I can pay him back...
               sometime. It's the only chance
               we have, Hector. Should I do it?
                               HECTOR
               You must.
                               LUCINNIUS
               You're right.    I must.

     This burst of resolve has relaxed Lucinnius.   His tense
     muscles yield more to Hector's fingers.
     THALIA enters the room. She is a household slave, a
     Nubian from Africa. She carries a lighted torch and
     moves around the room lighting the wall lamps. Lucinnius
     watches her.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Thalia, I think I need one of
                  your massages. Hector, you can                       *
                  finish the lamps.
     Hector does as he is told. He takes the torch from
     Thalia and discreetly leaves the room, hearing Lucinnius
     as he closes the door.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Lower, Thalia.

28   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                   28

     Late at night, Hector is still awake. He rises from his
     bed and quietly moves out of the room. He is careful
     not to disturb the sleeping forms lying all around him,
     some of them sprawled on the floor. He shares his bed-
     room with at least eight other slaves. Privacy is a
     master's privilege.


29   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                           29
     In the darkened house, Hector makes his way up some
     stairs and along a passage. The only sound is a crack
     or two of far-away THUNDER. At the end of the passage,
     Hector finds a small ladder propped against the wall.
     He climbs this, and lifts open the trap door above his
     head.


30   EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                            30
     Odd flashes of lightning far out to sea are the only
     source of light as Hector moves across the flat roof.
     In one corner he sees what he is looking for, the outline
     of a figure resting against the low parapet wall. He
     moves towards it. The figure speaks.

                                FIGURE
                  I missed you last night.
     It is Thalia. We can tell that they are close.      Hector
     sits down beside her.

                                HECTOR
                  He kept me working until morning.

                                THALIA
                  What's happening?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              20.

                                HECTOR
                  He has no money and a lot of
                  enemies. If he's very clever he'll
                  survive... but the omens are bad...
                  and he's not very clever.

                                THALIA
                  She doesn't like him.
                                HECTOR
                  Nobody does. He's unfortunate.
                  You get people like that. Clumsy
                  and sad.
     Thalia looks out towards the sea.

                                THALIA
                  Why does the thunder always stay
                  out on the ocean?
     Hector puts an arm around Thalia. At first it feels                 *
     strange, their physical intimacy alongside their matter-
     of-fact conversation, but gradually we understand it, the
     giving and taking of comfort where it can be found, and
     the realness of their friendship. Their stroking and
     touching and holding becomes good to watch. We get a
     feeling for what they have given one another, in stolen
     hours and half hours, up here on the roof, the only place
     where they can be themselves.
                                HECTOR
                  It's the Gods arguing. They're
                  working out what to do with
                  Lucinnius... he'll be lying awake
                  down there... wondering what
                  they're saying about him.

     They laugh.    Far away some street DOGS BARK.
                                HECTOR
                  If he goes down I'll ask for my
                  freedom... he owes it to me... he
                  said as much... you too... we
                  could be free...

                               THALIA
                  Then what?
                                HECTOR
                  What we talk about.

     By now he is kissing her.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                THALIA
                  We talk about going home. Yours
                  is that way and mine is that
                  way... your family is that way.
                                HECTOR
                  I just made that up... I don't                           *
                  know which way they are... anyway                        *
                  ... you can't think like that.                           *
                  Not after so many years...                               *

                                THALIA
                  It's what you talk about.
                                HECTOR
                  We talk about it because it can                          *
                  never happen. What we do is you                          *
                  and me...
                                THALIA
                  I don't understand. I think you'll
                  leave. You're going to leave me
                  here.

                               HECTOR
                  Never. It's you and me now.
                  That's all.
                                 THALIA
                  Well.   We stay here.   He'll survive.                   *
     Hector is silent, still kissing her.      He yawns as he              *
     speaks.

                                HECTOR
                  Then I can see you every night.
                  I'm tired.

31   INT. HECTOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                       31

     Hector is back in his bed. A figure enters the room,
     steps over the sleeping bodies on the floor and shakes
     him awake. Hector comes to. Lucinnius stands over him,
     whispering.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  I can't sleep. Get me a chicken.
                  I want to make another sacrifice.
                  We'll do it ourselves.

     Hector wearily takes himself out of bed and follows
     Lucinnius out of the room.

                                                           22.        *

32   INT. HENHOUSE - NIGHT                                       32
     Hector is in the henhouse, in the dark, selecting a
     chicken for sacrifice. He is about to leave when he
     sees a MAN and WOMAN, arms around each other, sitting in
     a corner. The Man looks at the white hen Hector is
     holding.

                             MAN
               Can't you find a woman, Hector...
     Hector smiles. He isn't surprised to see them. They are
     only doing what he and Thalia do on the roof. The Slaves
     have their meeting places scattered all over the house.
                             HECTOR
               Sorry to trouble you... just
               fetching a chicken... good night
               ... the roof's free...
     The Man shakes his head with a smile. Hector leaves, the
     sleepy chicken going to meet her fate in his arms.
                             HECTOR
               Come on, miss, you can tell
               Lucinnius his future.


33   EXT. STREET - MORNING                                       33
     Hector and Lucinnius are approaching the home of Cyprian.
     Hector as usual is walking some paces behind his master,
     and he carries a large satchel of documents. Cyprian's
     home is a street palace. It is early in the morning, but
     there is already activity around the house, visitors
     coming and going, messengers, petitioners. A few impor-
     tant callers arrive in litters, carried by slaves.
     Lucinnius and Hector even have to join a line at the door
     and are checked in by the gateman. Lucinnius's hopes of
     quietly bending Cyprian's ear are dashed. It seems as
     if the whole world owes allegiance to this provincial
     Mr. Big.


34   EXT. COURTYARD - MORNING                                    34
     The slaves gather on one side of the courtyard, gossiping
     and playing games of chance on the ground. Their masters
     wait on the other side of the courtyard, seated on
     benches along the wall. Cyprian's aides usher the
     visitors into his presence in a regular flow, some have
     an audience of a few minutes, others last merely seconds.

     Hector keeps an eye on Lucinnius, like a mother watching
     her child from a distance on its first day at school.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              23.

34   CONTINUED:                                                     34
     Lucinnius, sitting expectantly in line, does look a
     little pathetic, even ridiculous. Straight-backed, hands
     on knees, alert, worried, he looks a bit like a sacri-
     ficial offering himself.
     Hector plays a game of five-stone with some other slaves
     as he watches Lucinnius shuffling up the bench place by
     place to the front of the line. We almost expect Hector
     to give him a little wave of encouragement as he is
     finally summoned into the inner office. Hector waits.
     The first signs seem good. Lucinnius doesn't emerge
     within the first minute. Cyprian is at least giving him
     the time of day. More minutes pass. Hector watches a
     game of handball while keeping an eye on the office door.
     One or two others, familiar to us from the bathhouse, go
     into the office. So does Lucinnius' friend Julian.

     Eventually Lucinnius emerges into the sunlight, a broad
     smile on his face. Hector relaxes and leaves the ball
     game to join him.
                                HECTOR
                  You look happier.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Relieved anyway... relieved that
                  it's over at last.
     Lucinnius strides out of the courtyard with Hector
     following after him.

35   EXT. STREETS - DAY                                             35

     Lucinnius and Hector are walking home in their usual
     formation. Hector is closer than normal, so that they
     can talk.

                                HECTOR
                  Will he help you?

                                LUCINNIUS
                  I have to kill myself by tomorrow
                  morning. He has all my letters to
                  Titinius, none of them got
                  through. He says it's like
                  treason... and he says I should
                  want to die for owing him half a
                  million anyway...

     Hector is shocked.

                                HECTOR
                  What if you don't...

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              24.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Then he will... and that wouldn't
                  be pleasant... he would drag me to
                  Rome... those letters...
     Lucinnius shivers to think of them.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  I'm done for, Hector... but it's
                  strange... I feel kind of good
                  about it... the struggle is over
                  ... we've seen it through
                  together, eh?
                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what to say.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Let's get home. We have a lot to
                  do.
     Lucinnius quickens his pace.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Tonight... peace at last...
     Lucinnius is obviously in a state of shock.


36   INT. HOUSE - DAY                                               36
     Hector and Lucinnius are in his study. Lucinnius is
     busy clearing up his papers. He is less hysterical than
     in the previous scene, more aware of the reality of what
     he has to do.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  We'll do it with a knife, Hector.
                  When everyone has gone to bed.
                  The two of us, to the end...

                                HECTOR
                  I don't understand. What do you
                  want me to do... I don't think I
                  can help you...

                                LUCINNIUS
                  We'll help each other, Hector. We
                  must. We've been through this
                  whole mess together... we must die
                  together.

                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what you mean.   What
                  mess?                                                *
                                LUCINNIUS
                  You don't understand do you? I'm
                  asking you to die with me...
                  you're my closest, my dearest
                  slave... what would they say about
                  me if you refused to die with me?
                  This is honor... we're choosing                      *
                  death... we're not going to submit
                  to the humiliations that Cyprian
                  can heap on us, are we?

                                HECTOR
                  You say we... I don't know... what
                  is we? I've done nothing... I                        *
                  know nothing...
     Lucinnius changes his tone, becomes more, in his own
     mind, frank, man-to-man.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Hector... at Cyprian's this morning
                  ... I had to sign certain papers
                  ... tell a bit of a story...
                                                                       *
                                HECTOR
                  What kind of story?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  A confession. That we were
                  plotting against Cyprian and the
                  provincial senate... we were short
                  of names... most of the people I
                  know were in the room... people I
                  thought were my friends... so I
                  mentioned you... I had to...
     Hector is stunned with shock...

                                HECTOR
                  So I'm a conspirator?

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Yes. So you see, I don't want you
                  to die with me just because of my
                  honor... it's more complicated...
                  I'm sorry, Hector. I would be
                  honored... if you would die with
                  me... I mean it...
     Hector manages to speak.

                                HECTOR
                  Can I sit down?

                               LUCINNIUS
                  Of course.

                                HECTOR
                  This is the worst it's been.

37   EXT. COURTYARD - DAY                                           37

     Hector is in   the inner courtyard of the house, beside the
     kitchen. He    is talking to GALLUS, who is Lucinnius's
     ten-year-old   son. Hector has a close friendship with
     him. As we    listen to their conversation it becomes clear
     that Hector   finds comfort in the boy, for the family that
     he lost.
     Today there is an air of distraction about Hector.
     Understandable, considering his scheduled death.
     The kitchen slaves come and go as they talk.

                                HECTOR
                  But even if it's round you can
                  still fall off the edge.
     Hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make
     his point.
                                GALLUS
                  No... it's not round like that...
                  it's round like this.
     Gallus sees his playball.     He picks it up.

                                HECTOR
                  Do you believe everything that
                  Greek tells you...?

     Gallus ignores this tease, intent on the ball.
                                GALLUS
                  Rome must be right in the middle...
                  here... and we must be out here
                  somewhere...
     Hector becomes more interested.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         27.

37   CONTINUED:                                                37
                                HECTOR
                  So, where is my home?

                                GALLUS
                  How many months did they march you
                  here?

                               HECTOR
                  Seven.
     Gallus walks out the distance from Rome with his fingers,      *
     as if there is serious calculation.                            *
                                GALLUS
                  It must be about here.                            *

     His fingers stop on the other side of the ball.
                                GALLUS
                  But then you'd be upside down...
                                HECTOR
                  I wasn't upside down... and how                   *
                  could you see the sun round there
                  ... I saw the sun at home... every
                  day...
     Gallus is stumped for answers.                                 *

                                GALLUS
                  I'll ask him tomorrow...                          *
     Hector remembers that he and the boy's father are              *
     supposed to die that night. He looks on Gallus with a          *
     new tenderness.
                                HECTOR
                  Yes, tell me tomorrow... I'd like
                  to know... because my children are
                  round there and I want to know
                  that they're getting the sun...
                  ask him something else, too...
                  where are the gods if the whole
                  thing is round?

                                GALLUS
                  I think I know that... they're out
                  here, and all around... that's how
                  they can look down and see
                  everything...

38   INT. ALTAR - NIGHT                                        38
     Lucinnius is at it again. In the lamplight, a live
     chicken stands on the altar.
                                               (CONTINUED)

                                                            28.

38   CONTINUED:                                                   38
     Hector and Lucinnius watch it as if their lives depended
     on it. Perhaps they do.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  If he eats the grain it means yes.

     He scatters some grain on the table.     The chicken at once
     begins to peck them up.
                                HECTOR
                  It's saying yes... there's a way...

                                LUCINNIUS
                  No, it's saying yes, we should die.

                                HECTOR
                  But you asked it if we had to die,
                  or if there was another way... it's
                  saying yes, there is...
                                LUCINNIUS
                  No, it's saying yes, we should die.
     The bird is certainly enjoying his food.
                                HECTOR
                  Maybe it's just hungry...
     The chicken is inscrutable, as they are prone to be.
39   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                     39
     A dead chicken adorns Lucinnius's table. He and his
     wife, DALMIA, and their son are lying on their couches
     picking at the food with their fingers. Lucinnius is
     drinking more wine than usual. Hector and the other
     household slaves are in attendance. Thalia is also
     there, serving her mistress.
     Dalmia knows something is up, but she doesn't know what.
     She attempts to break the silence. She calls on the cook
     from the kitchen.
                                  DALMIA
                  Solus!

     The kitchen slave quickly appears.
                                DALMIA
                  Solus... I'm eating chicken again.
                  I ate chicken yesterday and the
                  day before... will I be eating
                  chicken again tomorrow? Why am I
                  always eating chicken?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                           29.

39   CONTINUED:                                                  39
     SOLUS looks up at Lucinnius and Hector, but they offer
     him no help.

                                SOLUS
                  It's what we have to hand in the
                  kitchen, ma'am... I always try to
                  use the fresh stuff... the
                  chickens have just been turning
                  up...
     He looks again at Lucinnius and Hector. They look at
     each other. Thalia looks at Hector. Dalmia looks at
     them all looking at each other, more intrigued than she
     was before.

     A SLAVE interrupts them.

                                SLAVE
                  Two men have come to see you.
                  From Cyprian.
     Lucinnius and Hector look at each other and share a
     moment of hope. They might be coming with good news,
     perhaps a softening of Cyprian's heart.


40   INT. RECEPTION ROOM - NIGHT                                 40
     The two VISITORS that await Lucinnius and Hector are an
     unpromising sight. They are big men, unsophisticated and
     look uncomfortable in their well-cut togas. A couple of
     the godfather's foot soldiers.
     They greet Lucinnius deferentially, but he knows that
     they would break his back at the whim of their master.
                                VISITOR
                  Good evening, Lucinnius. Cyprian
                  asked us if we could be of any                      *
                  assistance... in the business that
                  you have to conduct tonight... to
                  make that business as...                            *
                  comfortable... as you could wish...
     Lucinnius sighs, as his last hope expires.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you, gentlemen... But I feel
                  that I will be capable of taking
                  care of my affairs tonight without
                  your help... Thank Cyprian for his
                  kind thought...
     The heavies metaphorically keep their foot in the door.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                          30.

                                  VISITOR
                  We're   spending the night at the
                  house   of Nepos, not far from here.
                  Don't   hesitate to send your man for
                  us...   at any time... We're anxious
                  that   things should go well for you.

                                 LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you.   Good night.
                                VISITOR
                  We'll call in the morning at any
                  rate... just to make sure.
                                 LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you.

     Hector is closing the door when one of the Visitors talks
     roughly to him.
                                  VISITOR
                  You.    Come here.
     Hector instinctively looks to his master. Lucinnius
     doesn't protest, but retreats into the house. Hector is
     left alone with the Visitors.
                                VISITOR
                  He looks like the kind that'll
                  want some help. Have you ever
                  killed before?
                                HECTOR
                  Only chickens.
                                VISITOR
                  He's not much different. Use a
                  thin blade, but long. Get it in
                  deep... the heart... feel for a
                  space between the ribs...

     He prods at Hector's body freely, showing him what to do.
     If it is ticklish, Hector doesn't let on.
                                VISITOR
                  ... or go in from the back... any
                  place he'll let you...
     We leave Hector nodding obediently as this weirdest of
     coaching lessons continues.

                                VISITOR
                  Getting it out's not as easy as
                  you might think... you have to
                  twist a bit... to get over the
                  stickiness...

                                                             31.

41   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                            41
     Late at night in Lucinnius's study, an oil     lamp and a
     candle cast their shadowy light, adding to     the tension in
     the room. Hector stands beside Lucinnius,      who is
     counting out coins and other valuables on     his table.
                             LUCINNIUS
               Eight hundred sesterces... cash
               ... that's all that's left... what
               a failure... my father left me
               three farms and forty thousand...

     Lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. He is
     quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. Hector however is
     cold sober, grim-faced. Lucinnius looks up at him.

                             LUCINNIUS
               Nothing else to be done.    Don't
               you want some wine?
                             HECTOR
               No... but I want something...
                               LUCINNIUS
               What is it?
                             HECTOR
               I want to die a free man... I
               don't want to die a slave...

     Lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. He              *
     clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony
     into his voice.
                                LUCINNIUS
               Hector,    by this proclamation, I
               make you    a freed man... I don't
               know the    exact words... I've never
               done it    before... But you're free,
               Hector.
                                                                        *
                             HECTOR
               In writing... so that when they
               find me... they know I died a free
               man... please...

     Lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for
     his paper and pen.
                               LUCINNIUS
               Very well...

     He scratches out a few words on the paper, Hector looking
     over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes.
     Lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.

                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                              32.

41   CONTINUED:                                                      41
                                LUCINNIUS
                  They'll find it in the morning.
                  It's a nice thought, Hector... you
                  were right to ask.
                                  HECTOR
                  Thank you.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Well... freed man, let's do it.                         *

     Lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on
     the table. He fingers its blade.
                                                                          *
     A trickle of fear passes across Hector's face.       Will the
     half-drunk Lucinnius want to kill him first?

                                HECTOR
                  What do you want me to do?
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Nothing... I mean, not to me... I
                  have to do it first... you
                  understand that... and then you...
                  if I don't succeed... then you
                  must help me...
                                  HECTOR
                  I understand.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  No point in messing up the room.
                  Let's go downstairs.

     Lucinnius stands and leaves the room.     Hector follows
     with the oil lamp.


42   INT. PASSAGE - NIGHT                                            42
     The house is quiet and in darkness as they walk along the
     passage and down the stairs to the washing room. Hector
     walks behind, casting the light on Lucinnius's crumpled,
     defeated form. Lucinnius begins to sob, at first
     quietly, then more loudly and more pathetically. Hector
     looks around and behind him, afraid, or perhaps hoping,
     that Lucinnius's moans will wake the household.

43   INT. WASH ROOM - NIGHT                                          43

     Lucinnius has worked himself into a dramatic state of
     distress, with drink and terror and self pity.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              33.        *

43   CONTINUED:                                                     43
     He runs into the tiled washing room, wails loudly and
     makes a stabbing motion at his stomach. Hector sees all
     of this from behind as he enters the room. Lucinnius
     crumples to the floor and squats on his knees. He calls
     out in pain.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Oh, that hurts, that stings!
     Lucinnius sits back on the step of the washing pool,
     holding his stomach. Hector sits down beside him. They
     both look down at the blade, still in Lucinnius' body.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  This is hopeless.

     They sit absurdly like this for a long moment, neither
     of them knowing what do do next. It's awkward, like in a
     waiting room. Then Lucinnius speaks.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Help me, Hector...
                                HECTOR
                  You've done it... you've done it
                  ... lie down...
     Hector speaks gently, like coaxing a frightened animal.
     He helps Lucinnius lie out on the marble floor.
                                HECTOR
                  Close your eyes... you did it...
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Thank you, thank you.
     The movement has increased the spread of blood over
     Lucinnius' clothing. He raises his head.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  You do it now, Hector... hurry...

                                HECTOR
                  Lie still... lie still...

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it Hector... do it... you
                  promised...
     It looks as if Hector is playing for time.

                                HECTOR
                  Shush... I'll need the knife...
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           34.

43   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           43
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Take it... do it...

     Lucinnius' voice is fading now. Hector waits, then
     reaches down for the knife in Lucinnius' stomach. We
     see on his face the effort as he pulls at it, and do we
     detect a subtle twisting of the blade to speed Lucinnius
     on his way? Lucinnius sighs and twitches a little. It's
     as if the life flows out of him as the knife is released
     from the wound. His voice is even more faint.

                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it, Hector... do it... do it...
     Hector has the knife in his hand, but still he waits,
     looking at Lucinnius, willing the last dregs of life from
     him.
                                LUCINNIUS
                  Do it... do it... do it...
     The whispers fade to a croak. Lucinnius lies still.
     Hector has won this final battle of wills. He stands    up,
     suddenly repulsed by what has happened. But quickly    he
     gathers his wits. He makes his decision. He throws     the
     knife down. It clatters along the hard shiny floor.
     Hector has run out of the room before it has come to    rest
     against the wall.

44   INT. STUDY - NIGHT                                          44
     Hector runs into the study and makes for the box contain-
     ing the coins. He puts most of them into a leather money
     bag and ties it to his waist. Then he pulls on
     Lucinnius's cloak and rushes out of the room. He returns
     quickly to pick up his certificate of freedom from the
     table. Then just as he is leaving, he again stops, sits
     down on the chair, pulls off his worn shoes and places on
     his feet a pair of Lucinnius's stout street sandals.
45   EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT                                      45

     Hector is walking quickly from the kitchen across the
     courtyard to the street gate. Near the gate he stops
     and looks back at the house. He makes a decision and
     retraces his steps across the courtyard and back into
     the house.
46   INT. THALIA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                  46

     Thalia is sleeping in a large pallet bed on the floor
     with two other women. Hector gently shakes her shoulder,
     trying not to wake the others. After a moment or two
     Thalia opens her eyes.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              35.

46   CONTINUED:                                                     46
     Hector whispers to her before she has time to open her
     mouth.

                                HECTOR
                  I'm leaving... come now if you
                  want to... but we must hurry...
                  I'm a free man... I'm free.
                  Will you come?

47   EXT. HARBOR - NIGHT                                            47

     The shadowy cloaked figures making their way down to the            *
     harbor are Hector and Thalia.                                       *

     Nearer the harbor we sense the nighttime work of loading
     and preparing ships for the morning tide. By the light
     of oil lamps cargos are manhandled aboard, voices shout,
     WINCHES CREAK. Hector encounters a night WATCHMAN, but
     diverts his suspicion by boldly addressing him.
                                HECTOR
                  I have some mail for Tyre... where
                  are the east-bound ships?
                                WATCHMAN
                  Ask at the harbor.                                     *
     With an authoritative nod, Hector strides off in the
     direction of the noise and lights, Thalia at his heels.
     Hector talks when the Watchman is out of earshot.
                                HECTOR
                  We want a timber ship... they go
                  west... straight to Rome...

                                 THALIA
                  And then?   Then you go home?                          *
     Hector hurries on, noncommittal in his reply.

                                HECTOR
                  You can go to anywhere from Rome.


48   EXT. QUAY - NIGHT                                              48
     Hector and Thalia approach a ship heavily laden with
     timber. Final supplies are being carried aboard, super-
     vised by two men on the quay. Hector approaches them.

                                HECTOR
                  Where is the Captain?

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                         36.

48   CONTINUED:                                                 48
                                CREWMAN
                  He's on the ship.

     He indicates a man standing on the rear deck. Hector and
     Thalia climb up the gangplank and approach him.

                                HECTOR
                  Good morning, Captain... I'm
                  looking for passage to Rome, for
                  both of us...

                                CAPTAIN
                  And who might you be?
                                HECTOR
                  I'm the steward of Lucinnius the
                  merchant... we have business in
                  Rome... I need an immediate
                  passage...
                                CAPTAIN
                  It's five or six days... to                        *
                  Brundisium... you can walk or ride
                  from there... you have money?
                               HECTOR
                  Of course.
                                                                     *
                                CAPTAIN
                  Well, let's see... passage for
                  two... food for two... six days...
                  what were you thinking of offering?
                                HECTOR
                  When do you leave?
                                CAPTAIN
                  Anxious to leave, are you?
                                HECTOR
                  Keen to start, yes.

49   INT. SHIP - DAY                                            49
     Hector and Thalia are asleep, huddled together in a cor-
     ner of the ship that they have claimed as their quarters.

     A CREWMAN comes and shakes Hector awake. He stirs himself
     to the sounds of a SHIP UNDERWAY, the sounds of the SEA-
     WASH, the WIND in the CANVAS, the MOANS of the TIMBERS.

                                CREWMAN
                  Captain says to come on deck.
     Hector wakes Thalia and they clamber out of the darkness
     of the hold onto the brightest, freshest of days at sea.

                                                          37.

50   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                             50
     There is no sign of land behind them. The ship is moving
     swiftly in a strong, clean breeze and a light sea. We
     can tell from Thalia's reactions that she has never been
     out at sea before, at least never above deck. Every-
     thing is novel to her and it shows, even the movement of         *
     the ship. Her excitement is childlike.

                             THALIA
               Where's the land gone?
                                                                      *
     Hector, too, is taken by the novelty of it all but is
     less prepared to admit it. He waves his hands around the
     empty horizon noncommittally.
                             THALIA
               Have you been on a ship before?

                             HECTOR
               Yes, of course.
     We can tell he is lying.
                             THALIA
               Me, too, but they kept us down
               there.
     She points down into the lower depths of the hold.   Then
     she gets even more excited.

                             THALIA
               Tonight... we'll be where the
               thunder is!
     They look at each other and then all around them. The
     freshness of the day and on an overwhelming feeling of
     freedom, exhilarate them. Their senses and their
     feelings, are in new territory. They are like children
     in a brand-new world.
     The Captain on the other side of the ship, beckons them.         *

                             CAPTAIN
               Thought you would like to see
               them.

     He points to three shapes in the mid-distance, ships
     heading for the port they have left. There is a thrill           *
     in their glamor, their fine progress under full sail.
                             CAPTAIN
               Your master's ships... going
               home...
                                                                      *

                  No... they can't be... they're
                  lost...
                                CAPTAIN
                  No they're not... I know these
                  ships... my brother-in-law's the
                  master of the big one with the
                  brown sail...
     Hector and Thalia look at each other. The Captain smiles
     at them and looks back to the ships, coursing healthily
     on their way.
                                CAPTAIN
                  Somebody been putting the wind up
                  Lucinnius? That's an old one...
                  didn't think anybody'd fall for
                  that...


51   EXT. SHIP - DAY                                                 51
     Later, the ship is still making brisk progress. Thalia
     and Hector are sitting on deck, some distance from one
     another. They are quieter now, more thoughtful. Hector               *
     catches her eye. Hector is drawn by her smile and moves              *
     to join her. They sit quietly, absorbed in thought,
     thoughts of each other, their looks and smiles tell us
     that. As if they are talking without words. Hector
     looks around him. A sailor on the forward deck is
     sorting out some rope, an echo of a previous time and                *
     place. The wind catches the sailor's hat. He grabs it
     from the air and spends time arranging it once more on
     his head, just so. A tiny human moment.                              *


52   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                                52
     A man is driving a heavy two-horse wagon. The wind has
     just lifted his hat from his head. He spends some time
     replacing it carefully, just so. Watching him from the
     back of the wagon is Hector.
     The drama of the lives of Thalia and Hector      has played
     itself out long ago. Between the breath of       sea breeze
     that lifted the hat of the Roman sailor and      the gust of
     mountain wind that snatches the hat of the      wagoner, lies
     1400 years.                                                          *

     Hector sits   in the wagon beside a woman. There are
     tantalizing   similarities between their situation and the           *
     one we left   Thalia and Hector in on the boat a few
     moments ago,   1400 years ago.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               39.

52   CONTINUED:                                                      52
     The woman and Hector exchange glances now and then,
     delicate signals of mutual awareness. Talking without
     words.
     They are not alone in the wagon, perched on its half load
     of timber. With them is a NUN accompanying a GIRL of
     about eight. The Girl is tearful. A man, his face
     unseen, is snoring underneath his hat. A younger man,
     gaunt and hungry-looking, is dressed in the rough
     travelling clothes of a monk or PRIEST. Even without his
     habit we would know he was a holy man. His incessant
     talk tells us.
                                PRIEST
                  We want to praise God because we
                  live in this ultimate age, when
                  all things are done, all is known,
                  all the wonders of his creation
                  revealed to us... nothing more for
                  man to see or do... all that is
                  left is the hope of salvation...
                  even for our humbler sisters...
     The Girl is sobbing through all of this.
                                PRIEST
                  Yes weep, child, weep for joy...
                  you are a glorious example to us
                  all... already a child of God's...
                  blessed to spend your earthly days
                  within his church as Christ's
                  servant... what generous parents
                  you have... giving you to the
                  sisters... What a sacrifice.                            *
     There is an Irish lilt to his voice which colors what                *
     he is saying with a tinge of mischief. He is a difficult
     fellow to pin down. Hector looks at him amusedly, still              *
     sharing his thoughts silently with the woman, BEATRICE.
     The Nun interrupts the Priest cheerfully.

                                NUN
                  She's already received the last
                  rites, before she left her family.
                  She belongs to God now... Don't you?                    *

     The child sobs more noisily.                                         *
                                PRIEST
                  Fortunate child, destined for
                  paradise. Untouched by the
                  abiding curse of carnal lust.   I

                  I will not join myself carnally
                  with any woman...
     He looks accusingly at Beatrice.                               *

                                PRIEST

                  from this world to the next... as
                  should every man...

     Now Hector is getting the hard looks from the Priest.
                                PRIEST
                  ... If all men forsook forever the
                  fleshy temptations... and held
                  womankind to barrenness... think
                  how much the sooner would come the
                  day of judgement... all God's
                  chosen gathered in paradise... I've               *
                  written a small treatise in favor                 *
                  of virginity, sister. We could                    *
                  discuss it later if you like...                   *

     The DRIVER of the wagon turns his head briefly to the
     Priest.
                                DRIVER
                  What are you talking about?
     Hector gestures to Beatrice that he is leaving the wagon
     to walk for a while and asks her to join him. She shakes
     her head with a smile. Hector smiles, too, then jumps
     down from the wagon and, walking slowly, allows it to
     gain ground in front of him. The ramblings of the Priest
     fade away.

                                PRIEST
                  It's simple, brother... if we
                  cease carnal union entirely then
                  in fifty or so years we'll all be
                  rid of our earthly lives and God
                  can proceed with His reign over
                  His heavenly kingdom... that same
                  paradise that God gave to man
                  before, but which man was so unfit
                  to inhabit that within seven hours
                  Eve was already tempting her
                  master and mate, and within nine
                  hours the Lord had to expel the
                  both of them! Just think, they                    *
                  messed it up in nine hours!                       *

                                                         41.

53   EXT. MOUNTAIN TRACK - DAY                                 53
     Hector smiles as the Priest's VOICE FADES into the dis-
     tance. It is a  cold fresh day of early summer. They are       *
     travelling high in the mountains. Hector dawdles on
     his way, eating a hard biscuit he takes from his pocket.
     The last sound he hears from the wagon is the renewed
     WAILING OF the GIRL. Hector lays himself down at the           *
     side of the road. His eyes begin to close. Then a SOUND
     in the distance makes him open them again. He listens.
     MORE SOUNDS drift up to him from the floor of the valley.
     He stands up and crosses the track. At first he can see
     nothing. He walks back along the rim of the road. Then
     he sees where the noise is coming from. A mounted
     skirmish is in progress, just where a wooden bridge
     crosses the small river, at the very bottom of the valley.
     There are no more than 30 knights in full armor, with
     twice as many foot soldiers and squires. Even from such
     a distance Hector can see and hear that the fighting is
     ferocious, almost insane in its intensity. From this
     distance it is like a puppet show, except the violence
     is real. The scene places Hector in his time and for us
     there is a strange feeling to it, almost as if Hector
     has awoken from sleep and found himself transported to
     some distant age. But this is not the case. Hector is
     where he belongs, in Medieval Europe.
     Hector makes his decision. With a last look behind him         *
     he runs off in the direction of the wagon. Like any wise
     citizen of a violent age, Hector knows when to leg it.


54   EXT. WAGON - DAY                                          54
     Hector catches up with the moving wagon and jumps onto
     it, happily back in the security of his fellow                 *
     travellers. He smiles at Beatrice.                             *

                             HECTOR
               A bit cold... walking...
     She smiles at him. He sits opposite her in the wagon,
     and allows his foot to touch hers. She doesn't move
     away. Hector calls to the Driver.
                             HECTOR
               How long to get there?

                             DRIVER
               When it gets dark, we'll be there.                   *

     Hector looks at Beatrice.

                  I thought I heard fighting... back
                  there...
     Beatrice replies, but in a language that Hector doesn't
     understand.

                                BEATRICE
                  I don't know what you're saying...
                  I haven't understood anything
                  you've said all day...

     Hector talks back to her.
                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what you're saying...

     They both smile. It doesn't seem to disturb them too
     much that they don't share a language. They repeat                  *
     their incomprehensible statements, just for the fun of
     it.
                                BEATRICE
                  I don't know what you're saying.
                                HECTOR
                  I don't understand.
     Beside Hector the Girl has stopped sobbing but she is
     still troubled. She turns to him and speaks quietly but
     with determination.
                                GIRL
                  I want to go home to my mother.
     Hector doesn't know how to respond. He can do nothing               *
     to help her, and anyway, is more interested in Beatrice.            *

55   EXT. FARMYARD - NIGHT                                          55

     It is almost dark when the wagon finally turns into the
     yard of the farm where they will spend the night.

56   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         56

     The Farmer and his Wife have laid out a table with
     simple food, a stew, bread and wine. The travellers settle
     down to eat. The Priest, however makes a performance out
     of his more modest needs. He calls loudly to the wife
     working at the open fire.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                  Just bread and water for me,
                  Mistress. I have no need of wine
                  or meat.
     She brings him a jug of water and he makes much of giving
     thanks to God for his simple meal, muttering his grace
     quietly to himself, excluding all others from his conver-
     sation with the Almighty.

57   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         57
     In the dark, sleeping bodies lie all over the floor of an
     upstairs room. Gentle snores and regular breathing lay a
     blanket of soft sound over the human forms.

     One of the forms stirs and sits up on one elbow. Hector,
     in another corner of the room, sleeping lightly, becomes
     aware of this. He watches as the figure stands up and
     picks its way between the bodies to the door. The figure
     pauses and crouches over Beatrice. Hector can hear the
     distinct sounds of the figure sniffing her, from head to
     toe, and then a deep, long sigh. The figure stands up and
     moves quietly to the door, disappearing downstairs.
     Hector rouses himself and follows the other.


58   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                         58
     Hector creeps cautiously into the dark kitchen. The                 *
     figure has gone to the pantry and can be heard RUMMAGING
     there. Hector creeps closer and sees that it is the
     Priest. He already has a chicken leg between his teeth
     as he hunts for a cup for the jar of wine tucked under
     his arm. He emerges from the pantry. He sees Hector
     standing by the table. They recognize one another and
     relax. The Priest doesn't re-enter his holy act. He
     speaks normally, cheekily.

                                PRIEST
                  God, I'm starving. Do you think
                  I dare heat that up on the fire?

     He indicates the large pot containing the remains of the
     stew.
                                PRIEST
                  No... I'll eat it cold... I
                  deserve to suffer.

     He pours some wine into the cup and slides it across the
     table to Hector.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     Then he digs his hands into the cold stew and eats chunks
     of meat as they talk.

                                PRIEST
                  Have some wine.

     Hector takes a drink.

                                HECTOR
                  I saw some fighting today... back
                  up the road...

                                PRIEST
                  So, the mad knights are at it
                  again... what were they, Swiss
                  or English?

                                  HECTOR
                  I don't know.    They all look the
                  same to me.
                                PRIEST
                  It might help us get through...
                  if there's a bit of confusion...
                  we'll still travel separately
                  though, for now.
     The Priest changes his tone of voice, mocking his own
     holy act.
                                PRIEST
                  But, Hector, you must keep out
                  of the way of temptation... I saw
                  the way you were eyeing up that
                  widow... now stay away from
                  that... although she is beautiful,
                  is she not... but we're going
                  home, remember.
     Hector is smiling.

                                HECTOR
                  How do you know she's a widow?
                                PRIEST
                  Look at her eyes... hungry eyes...
                  she could lead you into trouble...
                  she smells like paradise, though.
     He changes his tone yet again.       He talks straight.

                                PRIEST
                  Listen, Hector, let's get this
                  clear... if anyone's going to dally
                  with that widow it'll be me... you
                  couldn't handle her... she'd
                  bewitch you... at any rate, you're
                  not a sinning kind of fellow, are
                  you... why don't you get off up
                  the road tomorrow, and I'll catch
                  you up, in five or so days...

     Hector doesn't answer, but smiles. The Priest has
     stirred thoughts that he had intended to dampen entirely.
                                PRIEST
                  You're not a sinning fellow,
                  remember... another month and
                  we'll be at the channel, then
                  home... the little ones you only
                  talk about when you're drunk...
                  don't forget them...
     Hector still remains silent.        The Priest is worried.

                                PRIEST
                  Why do I always talk so much...
                  you weren't even thinking of her
                  'til I opened my mouth... but I
                  trust you... don't worry. I know
                  you wouldn't do anything to anger
                  your God, or me. Get me some
                  bread.
     Hector obeys the Priest without thought.        The Priest is           *
     happier now that he is in control again.
                                PRIEST
                  Who saved your neck in Venice?
                                HECTOR
                  You did, Ronald.

     Hector approaches the Priest with the bread.
                                PRIEST
                  And don't you forget it.

     He raises his cup to Hector.
                                PRIEST
                  May the Lord forgive us our sins,
                  those we have committed and those
                  we as yet only dream of. She's
                  a glory of a woman.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     For all his wit and endless talk we can sense a trace of
     vulnerabililty in Ronald. For all his bluster, there is
     the feeling that he needs Hector as much as he claims
     Hector needs him.

59   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            59

     Overnight, the remnants of a company of soldiers, fresh             *
     from battle, have collected in the courtyard. Some are
     tired, dispirited, others are wounded. Our Travellers               *
     watch from the farm window. A few mounted knights come
     into the yard, herding in front of them a small group of
     prisoners, well-dressed knights and squires.


60   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                           60
     The travellers look out on the exciting scene, and talk
     as they eat their breakfast of bread and milk.
                                PEDLAR
                  Hostages, too, they've got... they
                  only take the rich ones...
     He turns to the forlorn Girl.
                                PEDLAR
                  Have you ever seen so many fine,
                  rich men, my girl?
     Hector talks to the company, but means his words for the
     Priest.

                                HECTOR
                  I won't be travelling today.

     The Priest looks him straight in the eye.
                                PRIEST
                  The fighting's behind us, brother
                  ... you'll be safe enough.
     Hector shakes his head, catching Beatrice's eye.

                               HECTOR
                  I'll stay.
                                PRIEST
                  You should go.

     The Nun puts an arm around the Girl.

                  We're going. God will protect
                  his ewe lambs.                                          *
     Suddenly the door is thrown open and four SOLDIERS man-
     handle an inert body, dressed in full armor, into the
     room. They scatter the food from the table and lay out
     the MOANING suit of armor on it. A young SQUIRE follows
     them in and kneels by the knight in the suit. The MOANS
     are MUFFLED because the knight's helmet has been battered
     out of shape in the battle and can't be removed. The
     ugly dent suggests an equally ugly wound inflicted on the
     head inside. The Soldiers gingerly try to remove the
     helmet. Their efforts are useless. Blood oozes from the
     joints of the helmet. The MOANING suit of armor seems
     inhuman, robot-like.

                                SOLDIER
                  Must be sore in there.   Is it your
                  dada?
     The Squire looks at him and nods his head.       Hector looks        *
     with sympathy at the boy.                                            *

                                SOLDIER #2
                  If he's got a little head it might
                  be alright. Has your dada got a
                  big head?

     An OFFICER comes into the room.
                                OFFICER
                  Is there a blacksmith here?
                  Where's the smith?
                                FARM WOMAN
                  In the village, sir, half a day
                  away.
     The Officer looks at the moaning suit of armor, then at
     the astonished group of Travellers. He picks on the
     Priest.
                                OFFICER
                  You, Priest, come here... get to
                  work on him... he's not ready for
                  heaven yet... there's a hundred
                  thousand livres on his head if I
                  get him to Paris alive... Start                         *
                  praying... there's fifteen livres
                  in it for you if he lives...

     The Priest obediently goes up to the knight and starts to
     pray earnestly. The Officer turns to the Soldiers.

                  and one of you get back down into
                  the valley and fetch an armorer.

     The Soldiers scatter to   carry out their orders. Hector            *
     takes time to watch the   Squire still kneeling beside his          *
     father, quietly stroking   the helmet. Ronald the Priest
     mutters every prayer he   can remember. The suit of armor
     twitches and MOANS.

     Hector looks at Beatrice and motions for her to follow
     him outside. The Priest looks on helplessly as they
     slide past the table and head for the door.


61   EXT. FARM - DAY                                                61
     More soldiers have continued to make their way to the
     shelter of the farm. Everywhere is the chaos of war.
     Wounded men lie awaiting the attentions of either the
     medicos or the priest. Prisoners huddle in cowed groups.
     Everyone looks for food. Individual soldiers, like lost
     souls, run here and there trying to regroup with their
     comrades. The youngest are squires of twelve or thir-
     teen, the oldest are red-faced, overweight knights in
     expensive armor.

     Hector and Beatrice have found a quiet corner where they
     can sit and talk. Behind them is a group of soldiers,
     reserves who have not yet joined the battle. They are
     much fresher than the rest and are drilling as a disci-
     plined unit.
     Their movements are a strange cross between parade ground
     drill and battle training. To the BEAT of DRUMS they
     perform rhythmic, hypnotic movements, repeating the same
     pattern over and over again. A deadly dance, thrusting
     their pikes in unison. They become like one evil,
     inhuman machine. It is mesmerizing to watch, all the                *
     more so in relation to the coy seduction scene that Hector
     and Beatrice are acting out. They have the problem of not
     sharing a language, but, resourceful as lovers are, they
     soon employ this as another titillating element in their
     love-play.

                                HECTOR
                  I think you know what I'm saying
                  ... a little...

                  a word.
                                HECTOR
                  How come you don't speak like
                  anyone else? Are you far from
                  home? Home? Where you sleep
                  and live?
                                BEATRICE
                  I think I know what you mean...

                  I'm far from home, too... way, way                    *
                  over there... then across the sea...
                                BEATRICE
                  You're losing me again.

                  Have you ever seen the sea? Water                     *
                  everywhere... right to the end of
                  the world... I come from the other
                  side of the little water, then                        *
                  there's the big, big water... I                       *
                  had a friend who sailed on that...                    *
                  went too far... fell right over                       *
                  the edge... into nothing. They
                  never came back... they fell off
                  the world...
     Hector smiles, pleased with himself.    Beatrice laughs.
                                HECTOR
                  You think that's funny? It's
                  true... it's a sad story... you
                  shouldn't laugh.
                                BEATRICE
                  Talk about home again... remember                     *

                  where I'm going... I've been away
                  for too long... Some people locked
                  me up... I had to run away.

     Beatrice has her way, turning the tables on Hector.    He
     says it in her language.

                                HECTOR
                  Home... home...
     Beatrice smiles. In this tiny victory the dynamic of
     their relationship is set.
                                BEATRICE
                  That's it... clever boy!

     They fall silent, suddenly shy. Beatrice breaks this             *
     moment by reaching out to Hector's neck, very delicately,
     like a caress. Hector smiles. There first touch. Then            *
     it changes. Beatrice completes her movement with a sharp
     grab at Hector's hair, and pinches her fingers on something.
     Triumphantly she shows him the flea she has caught.

                                BEATRICE
                  Tick... it's a tick.

     Beatrice looks at him directly now, their intimacy well

                  Bet there's more in there. You
                  need a good going over... nobody's
                  been looking after you.
     She ruffles his hair, in a motherly but then again sex-                  *
     ually provocative way. He understands her well now.

                                HECTOR
                  Why don't we go somewhere and
                  have a good session... I could do
                  you... I'd like to give you a
                  good grooming...
     They understand each other perfectly now.         They look
     around for a more private spot.


62   INT. FARM - DAY                                                     62
     Ronald the Priest still kneels by the inert knight in
     armor. The boy Squire still sits by his father's head.
     Ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. The knight
     is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or
     moaning. The suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid
     as we look at it. There is no sense of it containing
     life. The Officer re-enters the room from outside.
                                 OFFICER
                  How is he?
                                PRIEST
                  Sleeping now... at peace, for the
                  moment.
                                OFFICER
                  Leave him for a while. There are                            *
                  a few souls out here you can help
                  on their way to heaven. Ten sous                            *
                  a soul to you... come on.

     The Officer leaves.       Ronald quickly follows him outside.            *
                                RONALD                                        *
                  Twenty sous is normal.    How many                          *
                  are there?                                                  *

     When they have gone the Squire gives his father a nudge,                 *
     but there is no response from the knight, just the
     impression of lifeless bulk.

                                                           52.

63   EXT. FARM - DAY                                             63
     Hector and Beatrice have found some privacy, near the
     trees and by a low wall. Some bushes hide them from
     full view of the farm yard. Hector is sitting cross-
     legged and Beatrice kneels behind him, giving his head
     a thorough going over. Mutual grooming is the original,
     and perhaps the best, form of foreplay. Hector certainly
     likes it.

                              BEATRICE
               That's four.

                             HECTOR
               Yes, it does feel good.
     She gives his scalp a final delicious rub, and then stops.

                             BEATRICE
               You can do me now.
     Beatrice loosens her clothing to bare her neck and
     shoulders. Hector begins to probe her hair and scalp.            *
     She arches her back under the first touch of his fingers.
     Hector laps it up, inspired to caress ever more tenderly         *
     her scalp and neck, still with the outward purpose of
     looking for fleas.
                             HECTOR
               Got one... a tiny little one...
               yours are so small... and fair...                      *
     To Hector even her fleas are a delight. He seems to want         *
     to keep it as a pet. There is no hope for this man.              *
     Beatrice moans softly, happily. Hector still kneading            *
     her scalp.
                             HECTOR
               I don't know your name. I'm
               Hector... who are you? I'm
               Hector.
     Beatrice replies with a hint of breathlessness.

                             BEATRICE
               Hector... yes... I'm Beatrice...

                              HECTOR
               Beatrice.
                             BEATRICE
               Yes. Hector... I think you'll
               have to do under my arms... I'm
               a little itchy there...
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              53.

                                HECTOR
                  Yes, I think Beatrice is a good
                  name.                                                  *
     Beatrice is sighing contentedly now.

                                BEATRICE
                  Maybe we should find the river,
                  and have a proper wash...
     In between parting the hairs on her scalp Hector is kiss-
     ing her on the neck now. At first it is small, snatched
     kisses amongst the grooming, but soon the kisses become
     longer and the grooming less.

                                BEATRICE
                  I'm still itchy lots of places,
                  Hector.

64   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            64
     The Priest is with some seriously wounded soldiers, laid
     out in a corner of the farmyard. Whether he is a bogus
     priest or not, Ronald is taking his duties seriously.
     There is a little of the rogue about him now. He sees
     the Nun and the little Girl preparing to leave. They
     have acquired a mule. They mount up, the Girl behind
     the Nun, and plod off through the farmyard. They stop
     briefly beside the Priest to say their farewells.
                                PRIEST
                  Goodbye, little girl... the Lord
                  will bless you, I know, in his
                  house.
     He talks to the Nun as they move off.

                                PRIEST
                  How long for you on the road?

                                NUN
                  Three or four days.
                                PRIEST
                  Good luck to you.

                                NUN
                  They're not killing nuns, yet.

                                PRIEST
                  The Saxon, won't he go with you?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                           54.        *

                                NUN
                  He's nowhere to be seen.

     The Priest watches them go, and then returns to his
     duties with the wounded.


65   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                            65
     The Nun's mule turns out of the farmyard and heads off
     along the track. A few Soldiers are burying some of
     their dead nearby. The Nun watches this and doesn't see
     what the Girl sees on the other side, the mingled bodies
     of Hector and Beatrice, all pretence at grooming now
     gone, engaged in fervent lovemaking. It's probably the
     first and last that the Girl will see. A smile flickers
     across her face before she turns away forever. Ahead of
     her there might be many a bleak night in her convent
     when she will remember the image, and that same smile
     will return to her lips.

66   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                         66

     The Priest is kneeling beside a young wounded Soldier.
     He is close to death, but in his youth is fighting it.
     He is frightened, and clings to the presence of Ronald.
                                SOLDIER
                  My name is Peter... don't forget
                  ... tell everybody that was my
                  name... Peter...
     Ronald is mumbling his prayers.
                                PRIEST
                  Lie still, Peter...

                                SOLDIER
                  That's it, Peter... tell everybody
                  ... write it... don't forget it...
                  Peter... tell them Peter died here
                  ... my name is Peter... Peter...
                  say it again.

     Ronald stays with the boy as he struggles against his
     own annihilation.
                               PRIEST
                  Peter...

     Ronald behaves well with the dying boy.

                                                         55.

67   INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                     67
     The Priest makes his way upstairs in the darkness. He
     yawns, a long, contented yawn. He has completed the
     hardest day's work that he has undertaken as a priest,
     if he really is a priest. If he is not, then the pre-
     tence has been just as exhausting. He wants to sleep.


68   INT. FARMHOUSE - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                     68
     In the room sleeping forms lie here and there in the
     darkness. Some officers have moved in and the place is
     more crowded than before. The Priest makes his way to
     his corner, but on the way he pauses by Beatrice. She
     snores lightly. The Priest bends over and takes a long
     sniff at her, then he sighs out his admiration.

     He steps over her and settles into his own space by the
     window. He suddenly misses the presence of Hector. He
     looks again at Beatrice, still and sleeping. What the
     Priest doesn't see is the extra pair of hands massaging
     her neck and head. She moans softly in her pretence of
     sleep.
     The Priest is troubled, suspicious, but he doesn't know
     why. He sniffs again, in the general direction of
     Beatrice. The mingled smells that his sensitive nose
     detects perplex him, but he settles down, pulling his           *
     cloak over his head.

     Across the room, Hector's head emerges from the covering
     beside Beatrice. They make love quietly in the dark,
     also enjoying the thrill of confounding the Priest.


69   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                       69
     The Priest wakes up. Outside he can hear the first
     sounds of the day, the murmuring VOICES of Soldiers in
     the yard, the CLATTER OF MILK PAILS. In the room it is
     still semi-dark. The Priest sits up. The others have
     already left, but Beatrice is there, stretching herself
     and fixing her hair. Hector is not with her. She smiles
     at the Priest. Then, in another part of the room, Hector
     emerges from what looks like a pile of clothing, sits up
     and smiles too.

                               HECTOR
               Good morning.
     Hector and Beatrice look at each other. The Priest looks
     at them in turn. Their cheeky act of innocence mocks
     him.

                                                              56.

70   EXT. FARMYARD - DAY                                            70
     Hector is washing himself by the stream that flows close
     by the yard. He drinks a handful of water for breakfast.
     The Priest sees him from the farmyard and comes to join
     him.                                                                *
     Hector is in a cheerful mood, pleased with himself and
     his success with Beatrice. The Priest is sullen,
     reproachful.
                             HECTOR
               You're a busy man, what with all
               these souls departing.
                             PRIEST
               There's nothing wrong with helping
               someone to die in peace. They
               want me to go with them.
                             HECTOR
               Nothing at all.
                             PRIEST
               Are you staying here?

                             HECTOR
               Moving on, as you told me to...
               we'll meet up, like you said.
               I'll wait for you at the channel.
                                                                         *
                             PRIEST
               She'll do you harm. I told    you.
               She might be a witch. Wait    for
               me. I still have the money     from
               Venice. We can be home in    a
               month.
                             HECTOR
               Witch my arse. Stop giving me
               orders.
     Both of them are unhappy now, confusing one another,
     spoiling their friendship.
                             HECTOR
               You're a strange fellow. Are you
               a priest? Are you jealous?

     The Priest is silent. They are saved from hurting each
     other more. A Soldier shouts down to them from the farm.

                             SOLDIER
               We're moving soon, Father.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              57.

70   CONTINUED:                                                     70
     The Priest turns to Hector for what might be the last
     time.

                                PRIEST
                  So, you're leaving?

                                HECTOR
                  You have work to do here.
     The Priest walks back up to the farm. Hector calls out              *
     what might be an attempt at an apology or simply another            *
     taunt.
                                HECTOR
                  I don't understand you.

     The Priest looks back at him briefly, then walks on.


71   EXT. TRACK - DAY                                               71
     Hector and Beatrice have packed their few belongings into
     a shoulder bag. They turn out of the farmyard and walk
     down the main track.
     Hector catches a last glimpse of the Priest being helped
     onto the back of a horse, behind a Soldier. He is ridden
     off in the opposite direction with the rest of the troop.
     Other battles lie ahead to be blessed, and more battered
     bodies requiring comfort.
     Hector and   Beatrice are enjoying the first pulse-
     quickening   flush of their intimacy, and the thrill of
     knowing it   will go further. They chatter freely,                  *
     despite not   sharing a language.
                                HECTOR
                  I'm glad we're going the same way.
                                BEATRICE
                  We'll have to sleep in the hills
                  tonight. Will you keep me warm?
     The damp greyness of the early morning has lifted and the
     sun is shining as they step out onto the higher hills.


72   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                            72
     Hector and Beatrice have stopped to eat. They shelter in
     the fold of a hillside, with a wide stream running some
     way below. Hector feeds Beatrice a piece of cheese from
     his knife.

     Hector seems to know what she is saying. He throws down
     his knife and cheese, lying down with her on the grass.
     He kisses her breasts and her body eagerly. He lifts her
     skirts and caresses and kisses her naked legs and thighs.
     She stretches herself out happily, arms spread wide on
     the grass. Hector talks through his kisses.

                                HECTOR
                  Why do you smell so wonderful?
     He lifts his head to let her see him sniffing.                     *

                                BEATRICE
                  Oh, you like my smell, do you? I
                  make it from the flowers. I put                       *
                  it here, and there, and there.
     Hector kisses her more. She smiles and turns her head to
     the sky. Then she starts to giggle.

                                BEATRICE
                  I don't believe it... someone's
                  watching us, the dirty devil...
                  don't look... he's down by the
                  water, by the rocks...
     Hector doesn't understand, and keeps on with his kissing.
     Only her persistent giggling makes him stop and look up.           *
     Hector sees him too. Down by the stream a head peering
     over the top of a rock, not even attempting to hide.
                                                                        *
                                  BEATRICE
                  Cheeky devil.

                                HECTOR
                  He's not moving. He must've seen
                  us, though.
                                                                        *
     She sits up and straightens her clothing, suddenly
     anxious.

                                BEATRICE
                  Don't look at him anymore. Let's
                  go... down the other side of the
                  hill.

     But Hector still looks at the figure in the distance.
     There is an uneasy silence while Hector works it out.
     Then he speaks.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                HECTOR
                  It's a dead man.

     Beatrice doesn't understand.        Hector stands up, still
     looking at the figure.

                                HECTOR
                  Come on, we're going that way at
                  any rate.
     They move cautiously. When they are closer to it, and                 *
     can see it for what is is, they walk straight for the
     dead body.

73   EXT. HILLSIDE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                              73   *

     It is the body of a young squire, handsomely dressed
     in the livery of his master. Such a squire would follow
     his knight into battle, guiding him through the chaos.                *
     But this boy seems to have died a less public, more
     furtive death. He lies leaning against a rock, eyes
     open, an expression something like a smile on his face.
     There is no sign of a wound.
     Hector looks around at the ground.
                                HECTOR
                  No sign of a battle... only a few
                  horses... or just one. He wasn't
                  killed in a fight.
                                BEATRICE
                  Poor boy. Isn't he fine-looking.
                  Look at his shoes.
     There is a sadness about this young death in such a
     lonely place. Hector and Beatrice are open to this sad-               *
     ness, but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain.
                                BEATRICE
                  We'll cover his eyes at least...
                  so the crows don't get him. Look
                  at these shoes, though.

     She is already gathering stones.        Hector sees what
     Beatrice is doing.
                                HECTOR
                  That's good of you.

     As he lays him down Hector sees a small, dry wound on
     the boy's side. Beatrice brings her armful of stones and
     starts to build a mound around the squire's head.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             60.

     Hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream.
     Soon they have covered his head completely with stones,
     his body lying exposed.
                                HECTOR
                  It's all we can do. It won't keep
                  the wolves away though.

     Beatrice is still taken by the boy's shoes.
                                BEATRICE
                  His feet are like mine, you know.
                  I'll give you mine, poor boy, and
                  I'll have yours. I have more
                  walking to do.

     She looks at Hector.
                                BEATRICE
                  It's not stealing if I give him
                  mine, is it?
     Hector watches as Beatrice exchanges her old shoes for
     the squire's. They fit her well, and she proudly shows
     them off to Hector. He smiles at her.

74   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                             74

     Later, Hector and Beatrice are enjoying each other
     immensely, making love by the stream. Beatrice hasn't
     removed her new shoes, she likes them so much. She is
     dabbing Hector with her perfume which, he has discovered,
     she keeps in a small bottle kept in a pouch on a chain
     around her neck.
                                                                        *
     Nearby the corpse of   the squire still lies, its head
     shrouded in stones,   as if absurdly hiding its eyes from
     the antics of Hector   and Beatrice. The old shoes
     Beatrice has placed   on its feet look odd compared to
     the fine uniform.                                                  *

     Hector and Beatrice seem unaware of the strangeness of
     their situation, but perhaps it only looks strange to
     our modern eyes.

     Hector continues to bask in her wonderful aroma.
                                HECTOR
                  You've put magic in this stuff,
                  haven't you, you're bewitching
                  me...
     They appear to get the gist of one another's love talk.

                  You're eager today, Hector, aren't
                  you? Is it all this death?
                                HECTOR
                  I don't know what you're saying
                  but I like you when you talk.

75   EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY                                           75

     Hector is watching Beatrice conduct some kind of
     ceremony over the corpse of the squire. She takes a
     handful of dried flowers or herbs from a pouch in her
     bag. Mumbling strangely and quickly to herself, she
     walks around the corpse three times, scattering the
     leaves over the body.
     Hector is fascinated, but a little uneasy. He watches
     from a safe distance. During the few moments that it
     takes, Beatrice seems like a different person.
     Then, all of a sudden, the familiar, friendly Beatrice
     returns. She completes her ceremony by throwing a few
     drops of her perfume over the body. She smiles.                    *
                                BEATRICE
                  That should help him a little.

                                HECTOR
                  We should go now. We've been here
                  too long.
                                BEATRICE
                  I wonder if his mama will ever
                  know what happened.

                                HECTOR
                  You said mama. I know what that
                  is... mama... We can talk the
                  same...

     They have reached the summit   of the hills. It is like
     the roof of the world. Below    them lies the valley. The
     air is clean. The landscape    looks untouched by man,
     but a few smudges of smoke in   the distance suggest farms
     or villages. There might be    the glimpse of a castle on
     a hill.

     If it all feels oddly familiar to us, then perhaps it
     is the memory of a picture in a forgotten story book, or
     an ancient landscape on a gallery wall. Once again in
     the film there is the tantalizing feeling of awaking not
     from a dream, but in a dream.

     The moment passes in the more down to earth concerns of
     Hector and Beatrice.
                                HECTOR
                  I have to keep the sun on my back,
                  that's what Ronald said... the
                  sun on my back all the way home...
                  I'll stay on this side of the
                  river...

                                BEATRICE
                  Yes, of course... we stay on this
                  side of the river, all the way
                  down... until tomorrow...
                                HECTOR

                  Yes... On this side. Then the
                  other.
     They move off, each thinking that they have reached
     agreement. Beatrice starts to sing as they make a                *
     gentle descent into the forests below.


77   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           77
     Beatrice is milking a stray cow they have found in the
     forest. Hector is watching her, especially her hands.
     She manipulates the udders of the cow deftly, sexily.
     Her hands seem to have sensual personalities all of
     their own. She is chattering non-stop, explaining the            *
     subtleties of milking to Hector. But he can't take
     his eyes or his mind off her thrilling hands. He
     responds distractedly.                                           *

78   EXT. HILLS - NIGHT                                          78

     Hector lies by their small fire, watching Beatrice, who
     sleeps by his side. She is dreaming. She mumbles in
     her sleep, whole sentences. She turns this way and that.
     Hector watches in fascination.

     We feel the echo of another night when a man watched
     someone sleep and dream.

     He handles some of the things spilling from her bag,
     lying beside him. Her dried flowers and herbs, which he
     sniffs, her little bottles and phials. Witches brew? Or
     simply an early version of a cluttered handbag?

     We don't know what is passing through Hector's mind.
     Perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying
     with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his
     side. And how many people have done that through the
     ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms?
     There are many ways in which we will be able to connect
     with this perplexed, flea-ridden man, far away from home,
     huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as
     we all are.

79   EXT. FOREST - MORNING                                        79
     Hector and Beatrice are on the move again. They make
     their way down into the thickening forest. Beatrice
     walks ahead, light-footed and humming to herself. She
     seems to be in comfortably familiar territory now. The
     mist swirls about him as Hector follows on behind,
     tagging along as if caught in her sexual wake.


80   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              80
     Hector and Beatrice have reached the river, broad and
     slow-moving. Beatrice has hailed a boatman from the far
     side. He maneuvers his small boat to them and they
     clamber aboard. Beatrice and the boatman greet each
     other familiarly. They gossip amiably as the ferry makes
     its way across the river. Hector sits quietly with a
     smile on his face, their chatter incomprehensible to him.

81   EXT. SHORE - DAY                                             81
     As they climb out of the ferry Hector is suddenly unsure
     of what he is doing.

                                HECTOR
                  I think we're going the wrong way.
                  I want the sun on my back. We
                  should have stayed on the other
                  side.

     He mimes what he means.

                  Don't worry... we're nearly there.
                  I'll fix your back for you... give
                  you a good rub.
     Before he can protest she has moved off.        So he follows
     her.

82   EXT. VILLAGE OUTSKIRTS - DAY                                    82

     They have reached the outskirts of a village. Beatrice
     turns off the main track and up a narrow path. Hector
     follows her. Soon she stops at a small house close to
     an orchard. The house sits in the mess of a run-down
     farm yard, chickens and goats running here and there.

     Beatrice opens the door of the house and goes inside.
     Hector hesitates before following her.


83   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                              83
     Beatrice turns to him when they are inside.
                                BEATRICE
                  Here we are... home... you want
                  some food... and then I'll show
                  you everything. We have a spring
                  ... you can wash...
     Hector stands looking around the small dark room.
     Beatrice suddenly seems shy and awkward.

                                BEATRICE
                  This is when I wish you could
                  understand me. You'll have to
                  learn, you know... I want you to
                  stay here. You want to, don't
                  you?

     Hector looks at her in silence.
                                BEATRICE
                  I look after the hens, and I make                       *
                  dyes from the plants, and perfumes
                  too. I'm good at that. But I'm                          *
                  no good with the sheep and the

                  two years...                                            *

     She crosses the room to a wooden chest under the window.

     She lifts the lid and removes some men's clothing, rough
     working trousers and a hide jacket.

                                BEATRICE
                  I still have his clothes.   I'll
                  make them fit you...

     She holds the jacket up against Hector to measure it.
     Hector's reaction to a dead man's clothing is                       *
     predictable.                                                        *

                                HECTOR                                   *
                  What did he die of?                                    *
                                BEATRICE
                  I'm getting shy. Imagine me being
                  shy with you... I made this for
                  him... tonight we'll try them on.
                  You're the same height as Arnaud,
                  but a little thinner. I'll make
                  them fit. I'm a good sewer. And
                  we have a big bed upstairs for
                  you and me, in the rafters... You
                  and me... sleep...
     Hector is beginning to understand what she means, but he
     keeps his feelings to himself. Beatrice talks on. Now
     that she has started, she wants to say it all.

                                BEATRICE
                  I like you. You like me too,
                  don't you? We were lucky to meet
                  the way we did. All the men around
                  here are old.                                          *
     Beatrice falls silent, overtaken     by her shyness. Hector
     understands fully what she means     now, but his mind is
     a confusion. He can't respond.       She tries to direct his
     thoughts to the one area she is     sure about.
                                BEATRICE
                  Come up and I'll show you the bed...
     She climbs a   ladder nearby and lifts open a trapdoor
     on the wooden   ceiling. Hector climbs up to join her and
     together they   stand on the ladder with their heads poking
     into the tiny   space above.

84   INT. COTTAGE - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                             84   *

     Beatrice is proud of her bed, a rough mattress on the
     floor covered in some blankets she has probably made
     herself.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     The bed takes up most of the space of the small attic.
     They look at it together.

                                BEATRICE
                  A good bed, eh? For you and me.
                  We can have fun up here... better
                  than a ditch...

     She laughs. Hector's expression lightens a little too.
     It occurs to him to take up her offer immediately. She               *
     catches his thought, and the moment tingles happily.                 *
     Then from outside they hear voices. Firstly a young Boy
     calling.
                                BOY (O.S.)
                  Mama, are you home?


85   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                              85
     Beatrice and Hector   descend back in the room. A BOY
     of about eight and   a GIRL of ten are coming in from the            *
     garden. They have    been working outside. Beatrice goes
     to embrace each of   them. Hector's face is a confusion
     once again.
                                GIRL
                  You were gone a long time.   Who's
                  this?
     The Girl eyes Hector up and down.
                                BEATRICE
                  This is Hector.
     Beatrice pronounces his name with care.      She stands
     proudly by her children.

                                BEATRICE
                  These are my children...

     The CREAK of a door makes Hector turn his head.
                                BEATRICE
                  ... and this is my mother....

     An OLD WOMAN stands in the main doorway, smiling at
     Hector and nodding her head. She speaks to her daughter.
                                MOTHER (OLD WOMAN)
                  So... you found one, eh?

     Hector stands, surrounded by instant family, and doesn't
     know what to do. Eventually he speaks.                               *

                                HECTOR
                  Is there water... to drink... to
                  wash?
     He mimes with his hands. Beatrice understands that he
     wants some breathing space. She talks to her son.

                                BEATRICE
                  Take Hector to the well... but
                  come here first.

     She takes off the dead Squire's shoes and puts them on
     the Boy's bare feet. He is delighted. He does a little
     dance in them before leaving with Hector.


86   EXT. WELL - DAY                                                86
     Hector stands at the well some way from the house.
     Beatrice's garden is a madness of wild flowers, harvested
     by her for scents and powders. She is a remarkable
     woman, living as she does in the harsh male world of
     her time. The scented air and the dizzy SOUNDS OF the
     BEES almost make Hector swoon. He is experiencing the
     full, heady impact of Beatrice, and it is summed up in
     a full-blown pollen-filled sneeze.
     He drinks at   her well. The Boy is beside him, still
     engrossed in   his new shoes. Hector splashes some water
     on his face   and looks back at the house. He has some
     decisions to   make.


87   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                             87
     The Mother sits by the window in the nearest thing to
     a comfortable chair that the house has to offer. She
     is working on some lace. Hector enters the room to
     watch her. He smiles and stands shyly at the door. The
     Mother thinks he wants her chair for himself. In a
     flurry of apology she rises, drops her work and motions
     for Hector to have the good seat. He is full of
     embarrassment.
                                HECTOR
                  No, no... sit down... I just came
                  to watch... please... sit...
     He guides the Mother back to the good chair. They
     struggle comically for a while, but eventually she allows
     Hector to settle her there. She mumbles unhappily.

                  We can't have this... this was
                  Arnaud's seat... it's yours
                  now... I can sit on the box...
     Hector gently pacifies her.

                                HECTOR
                  You must sit there... look...
                  you need the light from the
                  window... it's your
                  seat... I don't want it... it's
                  yours... I can sit on the box.
     The old woman   allows herself a shy smile. Whether in
     innocence or   mischief, she has secured the best seat in
     the house for   herself. If he stays, Hector will never
     dare rest his   bones in it.

88   EXT. YARD - DAY                                               88
     Hector has retreated to the yard. The Girl is
     boiling some dyes in a cauldron over an open fire. The
     Boy is working at a basketful of flower heads, pulling
     petals and separating the hearts, putting them in a
     large jar of colored liquid.
     Hector is aware of Beatrice watching him. She is
     returning to the kitchen, firmly holding a struggling
     chicken, wings flapping and feathers flying everywhere.
     This chicken is making the supreme sacrifice in
     Beatrice's final effort at total seduction, a wonderful
     meal. Hector is guiltily aware of this as their eyes
     meet briefly.
     Hector takes in   what the Boy is doing and joins in
     the work. The    Boy smiles at Hector's initial clumsiness.
     He motions for   Hector to have a sniff of the jar of
     liquid. Hector    does so.  The smell is heady and pleasant.

                               HECTOR
                  Ah...
     The Boy says something and points towards his sister.
     She stands by her cauldron, stirring the bubbling liquid.
     Hector goes to watch her work. He looks in the cauldron.
                                HECTOR
                  Good color... for cloth?

     Without thinking, Hector leans over the cauldron to
     sniff. A hideous odor assaults him. He backs off.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                             69.        *

                  Ugh...

     The Girl says something to him, and points to a bucket
     of liquid at her feet. Hector makes out something like
     the word "peepee."

                               HECTOR
                  Peepee?
     The Girl nods enthusiastically.      The Boy is sniggering.

89   INT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            89

     Hector sits at the table with Beatrice and her family.
     There is an air of awkward silence, although the Boy
     and Girl look openly at Hector, perhaps assessing him as
     a future father.
     The meal has been served in a communal pot. In Beatrice's
     house there is the luxury of small individual plates.
     The others wait for Hector to begin, but he indicates
     to the old Mother to help herself first. She does, and
     she doesn't stop until her plate is heaped high with
     food. There is definitely some power play going on in
     the old woman's mind, although her face is all innocence.
     Hector submits, taking only a modest portion of food.
     The old Mother's appetite is prodigious. It is comical
     to watch her little frame consume so much, quietly
     and methodically. She is an eating machine.
     During the meal Beatrice and Hector exchange glances. But
     this time their talking without words is a serious affair.
                                HECTOR
                  Mmmm... good food....

90   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                            90

     From the kitchen Beatrice watches Hector in the garden.
     he is making an effort to appear relaxed, but as he
     paces here and there Beatrice knows that he is unhappy.
     She leaves the kitchen to join him.

                                BEATRICE
                  Take a walk to the village if
                  you want... you look as if you
                  need a walk...

     Hector opens his heart to her, knowing she will understand
     his feelings if not his words.

                                HECTOR
                  I have to leave soon. I can't
                  stay... it would be wrong to stay
                  for just a while...

91   EXT. COTTAGE - DAY                                                91

     It is awkward for Hector to say goodbye.
                                HECTOR
                  I have to go... have to keep the
                  sun on my back... I have to get
                  home... I have a family, just
                  like you... I like you... you                             *
                  smell good... wonderful...

     Hector fumbles awkwardly with his bag and then walks
     off down the track. He turns to look at Beatrice.
     She stands outside her house for a long time, watching
     him until he turns onto the main road and OUT OF SIGHT.
     The pain and the awkwardness in   Beatrice and Hector
     are specific, but the scene of   parting is timeless.
     Is this the ten millionth such   parting, or the billionth?
     It is one of them at any rate,   and a sad one.


92   EXT. RIVER - DUSK                                                 92
     Hector has reached the river, but it is already growing
     dark and the boatman has gone for the night. Hector
     sees the boat, dragged out of the water.

     He sits down against the trunk of a large tree.       His              *
     eyes begin to close.                                                   *

     Hector awakes. He looks around him. He is on a huge                    *
     raft, made of ship's timbers. We have left our previous
     Hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. This
     Hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare.
     The huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together.
     There are over a hundred and fifty people perched on
     them, lying or squatting in sleep. It is early morning.
     The sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is
     still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing,
     like a controlled anger.

     Hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes.
     He speaks to ANDRE sitting close by.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

93   CONTINUED:                                                   93
     Andre is Hector's   slave, still bound to him in service
     through shipwreck   and disaster. Our Hector is now a
     master. Andre is    a young Asian. A quiet, capable,
     intelligent man,   but with that same lost look in his
     eyes that Hector   had as a slave. He too is far from
     home.

                                HECTOR
                  I had a wonderful dream. I was                       *
                  lying under a tree, beside a river.
                  I was dozing. I heard the water...
                  beautiful clear water. I got up
                  and drank some. I think I ate some                   *
                  raspberries too.

                                ANDRE
                  I would like some water.
     Hector looks around him at the squalid mass of distressed
     humanity.
                                HECTOR                                 *
                  God, this is the worst, the worst.                   *

     Some figures rise and an argument takes place, like
     a domestic squabble. We can hear some of their exchanges.
                                WOMAN
                  Let me keep him... they said we'll
                  find land in a day or so... you're
                  evil...
                                MAN
                  When they're dead they go over the
                  side... The place stinks enough
                  as it is...

     There is a flurry of movement amongst the figures, then
     a splash, then a cry of a Woman. The noise has awakened
     others. All over the raft figures are coming awake,
     sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful
     reality of their situation.
     Andre speaks to Hector.

                                ANDRE
                  Do you think I'll still see
                  Europe?
                                HECTOR
                  I think there's more chance of
                  me eating you, Andre.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                             72.

     The more we see     of the people, their costumes, weapons,
     mannerisms, the     easier we will place them in their
     time. They are      survivors of a foundered ship some time
     at the height of     the great colonial empires. The year
     could be 1590.      The place is the Indian Ocean.

     Hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft,
     closer to him. He watches a man and woman. The woman,
     URSULA, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of
     canvas. The man, FRANCISCO, stands beside her holding
     a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. His eye
     catches Hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a
     long time. There is antipathy but also pain in their
     look.                                                              *

     A man, DOM PAULO, moves among the waking wretches.      He
     speaks with authority.
                                DOM PAULO
                  I think today will be the day,
                  my friends. We've been in the
                  inshore currents since yesterday.
                  Three crowns to the first one to
                  sight the coast. God preserve us
                  all.
     Someone speaks from under a crude canvas shelter.
                                SAILOR
                  Never mind the three crowns... a
                  side of beef would do... or a drink
                  of clean water.
     Dom Paulo strides off to his station by the makeshift
     rudder.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Don't worry, there'll be food for
                  all ashore. Africa's full of
                  meat and drink.

                                SAILOR
                  It's full of Africans too.

94   EXT. RAFT - DAY                                               94

     The sun is up, and Dom Paulo was right. The raft is
     now standing off-shore riding out the heavy ocean surf
     before finally beaching. The strong are helping to row
     ashore, under the shouted instructions of the NAVIGATOR.
     Those too weak to help are huddled beside their posses-
     sions, hoping to survive this final trial of the sea.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                         73.

94   CONTINUED:                                                 94
     Hector works his oar with the rest. He has time to cast
     a glance at Ursula and Francisco. Francisco in his
     manic-heroic way manages to row while at the same time
     trying to offer a steadying arm to Ursula.
     If Hector had time or energy to laugh, he would.

     The raft is in the full rage of the surf. The sense
     behind its loose construction is obvious now. Snake-like
     it rides the waves, one half up, the other down. The
     beaching isn't easy. A few people are washed overboard
     with no way of saving them. Finally the raft makes it
     through the barrier of the outer surf. They are in a
     long curving bay. Up from the beach lies an area of             *
     dunes, and beyond that a thick belt of jungle.

     The raft scrapes onto the sand. Those near the beach
     scramble ashore, immediately prostrating themselves in
     prayers of thanks while those at the back jump into
     the water and clumsily wade the last few feet to safety.
     Hector's attention is never far from Ursula. She is             *
     struggling in the water with some of her baggage. A
     youth, NUNO, goes to help her. Hector overtakes him and
     nudges him out of the way, offering to take Ursula's load
     from her shoulders. She refuses his help. Waist-deep in         *
     water they tussle over her bundle of possessions. Hector        *
     overpowers her, wrestles her load from her grasp, angrily
     wades to the shore and dumps it on the sand. In amongst
     the drama of their situation their little battle of wills
     seems petty and pathetic, but it reveals much about their
     past.
                                                                     *
     Soon the survivors are dragging their possessions from
     the raft. They have managed to hoard a surprising amount
     from their doomed ship. Carpets, chests, chairs, all
     are dragged ashore.

95   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                            95

     Civilization has taken hold quickly in this little corner
     of Africa. Dom Paulo, the leader, already has a table
     and chair set up in the sand, and behind him SAILORS are
     erectig a tent-like house, made from timbers and rich
     tapestries and carpets. The others are making their own
     shelters all along the beach. A regular little community
     is taking shape, a crazy, rich-textured village decked out
     in all the colors of the East. The silks and ginghams
     that were destined for the finest halls in Europe now give
     shelter to sick slaves, starving sailors, ruined traders
     and grieving mothers.

                                                           74.        *

     Some of the survivors have   recovered sufficiently from
     the trauma of near death to   mark out the boundaries of
     their new beach homes with   lines of stones. The habits
     of ownership die hardest of   all.
     Although Dom Paulo is the man in authority he is also a
     man in deep shock. Most of what he has earned or
     plundered in his colonial years now lies at the bottom
     of the ocean. Since he is socially superior to anyone
     else on the ship he assumes responsibility and command.
     There are probably fifty men among the survivors more
     suited to lead them to safety.
     By Dom Paulo's side always is his SON. A quiet boy of
     about eleven. He is like a little miniature of his
     father, dressed in the same style of clothes. He is a
     constant, silent witness to everything that Dom Paulo does,
     good or bad, wise or foolish. He and his father are a
     continuing fascination for Hector, and we can enjoy
     Hector watching the boy watching his father. Some of the
     absurdities and comedies of the situation can be high-
     lighted in this way. There can be sadness in it too
     however, the pain of a son witnessing his father's
     compromises or failures all too closely, and Dom Paulo's
     sad awareness of his image slowly tarnishing in his
     son's eyes.
     Amidst the construction work, Dom Paulo is talking with
     some of his OFFICERS.
                                DOM PAULO
                  How many made it?
                                OFFICER
                  Eighty men. Ten women. Eighteen
                  children and forty-five slaves.

                                DOM PAULO
                  Two parties of ten men each... one
                  to the north and one to the south...
                  bring back what you can... game,
                  fruit, anything... and send someone
                  back as soon as you find fresh
                  water. Any trouble, discharge
                  three shots.

     The Officer leaves to carry out his orders.    Dom Paulo
     addresses another of his men, Da Cunha.

     Hector and Andre are walking through the half-built
     village.  Andre is carrying Hector's possessions, a
     rolled-up carpet and a bolt of colorful cloth. We feel
     an echo of the days when Hector was a slave, walking
     two paces behind with his master's possessions.
     Hector finds what he is looking for. Francisco is
     working on a shelter for himself and Ursula, with the
     help of some slaves. Hector approaches him, making
     another attempt to heal wounds from his past.
                                HECTOR
                  I have a carpet and some cloth...
                  I thought if we worked together
                  we could make a better shelter...
     Francisco barely stops his work to reply.
                                FRANCISCO
                  If it's a joke it's a poor one.                        *
                                HECTOR
                  At least ask Dona Ursula...

                                FRANCISCO
                  I don't have to ask her... I know
                  she would agree with me... leave us
                  alone.
     His stubborn rejection of Hector reveals just how
     strong their friendship once was.

                                HECTOR
                  Well... would you take my cloth,
                  at least?

                                FRANCISCO
                  Keep it and build your own hovel
                  somewhere else... leave us
                  alone...!

     Then from along the beach the sound of RAISED      VOICES
     distracts them. They see some figures, laden       with
     supplies, running off into the forest. Others       are
     following them, discharging MUSKETS, shouting      for the
     DESERTERS to stop. Hector and Francisco walk       briskly
     in the direction of the trouble. They see two       of the
     Deserters being overtaken by their pursuers.       The rest
     make their escape into the jungle.

97   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                                97

     Hector and Francisco reach Dom Paulo's office in the
     sand. The leading citizens are gathering there as
     the two captured Deserters are brought in.

                                SAILOR
                  They ran off with the dry bread...                     *
                  about eight of them, sir...                            *
     Dom Paulo looks at the two prisoners.
                                DOM PAULO
                  You men are deserters. You will
                  die tomorrow.
     He speaks again to the Sailor.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Chain them on the raft for tonight,
                  and watch them...
     Francisco steps forward, outraged.

                                FRANCISCO
                  I must object... these sentences
                  can't be lawful...

     Dom Paulo's authoritative manner vanishes in an instant.
     He becomes hesitant, unsure of himself. As always, his              *
     Son watches every detail of the exchange.                           *

                                DOM PAULO

                  and violence...

                  You're right... but then how can
                  we punish them? We can't lock them
                  up...

     Dom Paulo looks around at the assembled notables,
     confused, out of his depth. Other opinions are voiced.

                                SALGADO
                  You were right the first time,

                  mouths...
     The captured Deserters look on helplessly as their lives
     are argued over.

                                YOUNG DESERTER
                  I didn't steal any bread... Gomes

                  What do you think, Father?
     The Priest throws open his arms noncommittally.

                  So I was right the first time?

     Francisco confuses him even more.

                  It was Gomes... he told us to run.

                  I'll decide... no I won't... we'll

                  that matter are here... we'll have

                  Salgado... and me... that they
                  should die?
     A lot of hands go up. Hector hesitates, his instincts
     are not for killing. But the force of the majority
     weighs on him. He starts to raise his hand. At that
     moment, as he scans the crowd, he meets the eyes of the
     Deserter whose death they are voting on. For a moment
     they communicate. Hector is thrown. He drops his hand,
     only to find in the next instant the stern gaze of
     Salgado on him. He hesitates again, then starts to
     raise his hand. Then the eyes of the Deserter find him
     once more. This comic pantomime goes on while a solid
     majority of the crowd firmly raise their hands.
                                DOM PAULO
                  ... and those against death...

     One of the Deserters raises his own hand meekly.

                  You can't vote...

     Then he looks to Salgado.
                               DOM PAULO
                  Can he?
                                SALGADO
                  It doesn't matter.

     Then the other Deserter raises his hand too.
                                SALGADO
                  I don't think this is working,
                  Dom Paulo... we need authority...
                  you must decide...
     Dom Paulo thinks.

                                DOM PAULO
                  Very well... Da Cunha?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

     DA CUNHA steps forward.

                                DOM PAULO
                  The cross the carpenter is
                  working on... tell him to turn
                  it into a scaffold... have it
                  erected along the beach, away
                  from the women... the executions
                  will be at sunrise tomorrow. Tell
                  Father Diogo.

     He turns to the Sailors holding the Deserters.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Take them to the raft.

     The dazed Deserters are led off.       Dom Paulo's face clouds
     in doubt again.
                                DOM PAULO
                  Everyone in agreement with hanging?                    *
                  Or should we shoot them... or what?

                  Hanging is fine, sir.

                  to conduct the executions... should
                  we pick someone, or have a
                  volunteer...
     Dom Paulo looks over the faces of the men.       He stops at
     Hector.
                               DOM PAULO
                  Hector?

     Hector doesn't have the will to accept or the courage to            *
     refuse. He is saved by another young man, ALVAREZ, eager
     to prove himself.

                                ALVAREZ
                  I'll do it, Dom Paulo.

                                DOM PAULO
                  Thank you, Alvarez. Sunrise
                  tomorrow. Send the Priest to
                  them tonight.

     We can sense the feeling of relief in Hector. Dom                   *

     It is growing dark. Fires are being lit outside     the
     shelters. Andre is building Hector's tent while     Hector
     watches him. The tent is only large enough for     one
     person, and somehow looks mean compared with the    others.
                             HECTOR
               Good work, Andre.

     He looks across to the well-made shelter of Ursula and
     Francisco. Ursula herself works at the fire.
                                                                        *
     Hector turns to Andre.
                             HECTOR
               You go and sleep by the big fire,
               Andre. Keep warm.

     Andre leaves.

99   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             99
     Hector goes inside his little    house. He puts his back
     to the entrance and opens the    canvas sack which contains
     all his possessions. He pulls     out his prize, a sizeable
     chunk of bread and some dried    fruit. He guiltily gnaws
     at the hard bread.
     He is surprised by the sound of the boy, Nuno outside.
                               NUNO
               Senor Hector?
     Hector quickly stows his food back into his sack, and
     with a grunt of irritation sticks his head out of the
     shelter.

     Nuno is holding four fruits, about the size of large
     apples, but green and thick-skinned.
                             NUNO
               This was all they found in the
               forest. Four for each of us.
               They taste kind of milky, but
               sour.

                             HECTOR
               Thank you, Nuno.
                             NUNO
               My mother ate three and she was
               sick. So try two... but she's
               sick anyway... maybe you can try
               three...

                                HECTOR
                  I'll start with two.

     Nuno makes to leave, but then hesitates.
                                NUNO
                  Hector, will you help me?

     Nuno is looking down the beach to the remains of the
     raft on the shoreline. The shapes of the two Deserters
     chained there can just be seen.

                                NUNO
                  Lopo... the boy they're going to
                  hang tomorrow... he was cook's
                  cabin boy... I was going to take                       *
                  him something to eat... I thought,
                  perhaps, one of yours and one of
                  mine...
     He looks at the fruit he has just given Hector.
                                NUNO
                  You said you might just eat two...
                                HECTOR
                  But there's tomorrow, Nuno... we
                  must eat tomorrow too...

     Nuno looks disappointed. His eyes turn again to his
     playmate tied to the raft.
                                HECTOR
                  Dom Paulo would call it a waste.
                  You must keep yourself strong, Nuno,
                  that's what he'd say... so that you
                  can help the others... God knows
                  what we have ahead of us... we'll
                  need strong people like you...
     Nuno is silent, unconvinced.

                                HECTOR
                  Try not to think about Lopo any
                  more... The guards wouldn't let
                  you near him anyway.

     Nuno stomps away in silence.       Hector shouts after him
     cheerily.

                               HECTOR
                  Goodnight!

                                                          82.         *

100   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                         100
      In the privacy of their tent Dom Paulo and his son are
      engaged in their nightly ritual, practicing on their
      recorders. Dom Paulo leads the young boy through an
      intricate, pretty tune. They sit formally and there is
      an air of stoicism about them, determined as they are
      to maintain their civilized habits in these bleakest of
      circumstances. But there is also a feeling of madness
      about it. The madness of a man who has lost a grip of
      what is going on about him. Down on the beach men are
      waiting to die in the morning on his orders. The blend
      of formality and madness make the scene comic.

101   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                          101

      The sun has risen sharply, soaring out of the ocean. It
      blinds the eyes of those in the little execution party
      making their way along the beach.
      The cross-cum-scaffold has been erected some way from the
      camp. Most people are  attending to their morning
      chores with one eye on the grim act of justice being
      carried out along the shore.

      Our view of the hangings will be from the distance of the
      camp; marionette figures, men dancing on ropes, the form-
      ality of legal death. The priest and the executioners.
      It takes a while for the people in the camp to become
      aware of the other observers up on the dunes. Three
      figures stand in full view, boldly, silently, watching
      the camp and the pantomime at the scaffold.
      The word passes around the camp. Eyes pass between the
      executions and the tall natives watching.   The first man
      is already dangling on the rope by the time that Dom Paulo
      and his officers are discussing the appearance of the
      natives.
                               DA CUNHA
                 Some gunpowder would scatter them,
                 sir.
                               DOM PAULO
                 No, they might want to be
                 friendly... they'll have food
                 too... get one of our African
                 slaves... we must try and talk to
                 them... If they think we're timid
                 we're dead.

                                                           83.

102   EXT. DUNES - DAWN                                           102
      A solitary SLAVE makes his way up from the camp to the
      natives on the dunes. Everyone in the camp watches as he
      approaches them. There is tension. Will the natives run
      or fight or talk. They begin to talk. The natives seem
      most interested in the hangings, and point in that
      direction, asking questions. The Slave makes an attempt
      at explaining what is happening, but the natives seem
      baffled. They start laughing and shaking their heads.
      By now the second figure is dangling on the rope, the
      cross making an efficient double-gallows.


103   EXT. CAMP - DAWN                                            103
      While Francisco's attention has been on the natives,
      Hector has sidled up to him, still hoping to ingratiate
      himself. He talks while they watch the two events, the
      hanging and the meeting.
                              HECTOR
                I hate it when people have to die.                      *
                              FRANCISCO
                It's foolishness. Killing our
                own men when we have the whole of
                Africa to face.
                              HECTOR
                It's foolish squabbling at all.
                We should be friends.
      Francisco looks at him for the meaning in what he is
      saying. Hector shrugs. He takes a small bundle from
      his jacket and gives it to Francisco.
                               FRANCISCO
                What's this?

                              HECTOR
                Some bread and raisins.

                              FRANCISCO
                I thought everything was shared
                out on the raft...

                              HECTOR
                Well this wasn't. It's for her...
                and you.
      Francisco looks Hector straight  in the eye, looking for
      his angle. But this time there   is none. Hector is
      simply a lonely man seeking to  retrieve lost friendship.
      There is a glimmer of sympathy  in Francisco's face.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

      On the high dunes the Slave and the natives have now
      parted company. The Deserters still spin at the end of
      their ropes, the Priest praying at their feet.
      Francisco walks away from him.      Hector calls out.

                                 HECTOR
                   I must speak to her!

104   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               104

      The Slave approaches Dom Paulo outside his tent.
                                 SLAVE
                   They want to make a visit here...
                   with their King... he will bring
                   gifts, and will receive gifts.
                   They said not to sacrifice anymore                     *
                   men for them... they don't like
                   that...
      Dom Paulo and the others laugh.

105   EXT. BAY - DAY                                                105
      The tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay. Barrels
      and boxes and timber bob in the waves. People make their
      way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the
      sea.                                                                *
      The whole of the camp is eager and shouting. They bring             *
      in the boxes and barrels. A whole harmonium is man-
      handled ashore. Some boys drag it up onto dry sand and
      start to work its bellows. At first only water spurts
      from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. The
      mood soon becomes festive. Dom Paulo makes his way down             *
      to the shore to make the celebrations official.                     *
      By now the first of the newly-arrived crates are being
      opened. Inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in
      crate after crate.
      An OFFICER brings the first of the eggs to Dom Paulo.

                                 OFFICER
                   Turtles' eggs, sir... Doctor Correa
                   was shipping them to the Royal
                   Zoo... I think they hoped some of
                   them would hatch.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Well... it's eggs for supper
                   tonight... for everyone...                             *

      That night everyone does eat turtles' eggs. At their
      fires in the dusk they fry them, boil them, scramble
      them. Some eat them raw. The abundant green fruits
      make a tolerable side dish. The happy mood of the
      afternoon has survived into the night. For once there
      is enough to eat, and the hangings are a thing of the
      past. Above the ROAR of the constantly rolling SURF
      the CROAKY sounds of the waterlogged HARMONIUM can be
      heard.                                                           *

107   INT. HECTOR'S TENT - DUSK                                  107
      Sadly for Hector, the harmonium enthusiast is very close
      to his shelter. The JANGLY MUSIC is loud and insistent.
      Hector removes six large eggs from a bag and takes them
      outside to his fire.

      grunts in annoyance and cracks another egg. The yoke is
      discolored and the smell is rank. Hector looks at Andre,
      rapidly finishing his omelette before Hector can demand          *
      it.
                              HECTOR
                Yours were fine?
                                ANDRE
                Yes.

      Hector picks up a third egg and shakes itclose to his
      ear. It seems as empty as the other two.  He picks up
      a fourth egg and cracks it open. A small dried-up, half-
      formed baby turtle RATTLES into the pan. Andre is
      quietly enjoying Hector's frustration. He stands up to
      leave.
                                ANDRE
                Good night.

                                 HECTOR
                   Have you any eggs left?

                                 ANDRE
                   The slaves only got three.    I want
                   to ask you something.

                                 HECTOR
                   You were lucky. What?
                                 ANDRE
                   I want my real name back.
                                 HECTOR
                   You don't like Andre anymore?

                                 ANDRE
                   I think of my home all the time.
                   I want to hear the name they call
                   me. We should die with our real
                   names.
                                 HECTOR
                   We're not going to die, Andre...
      Hector smiles at his own insensitivity.
                                 HECTOR
                   I've forgotten your name...
                                 ANDRE
                   Ketabomago Pululo.
                                 HECTOR
                   Now I remember why we called you
                   Andre.

      Andre looks at him expectantly.
                                 HECTOR
                   I will, Andre... I promise... I'll
                   call you that... when I remember...
      Andre is satisfied, and leaves.      Hector calls to him.

                                 HECTOR
                   Good night... Keta...

      Hector is alone. Hector gives up on the eggs and pulls               *
      out his store of bread and fruit from the tent. The                  *
      next source of annoyance is the continuing noise of the
      HARMONIUM.
      He shouts across to the musical enthusiast, a YOUTH
      with a few older children by his side.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hey! Stop that, will you? Think
                   of the older people, and the
                   sick... I'll give you an egg if                         *
                   you stop... here...

109   EXT. CAMP - NEXT MORNING                                       109

      The Officers and Dom Paulo are selecting items for barter            *
      from their crates and boxes of valuables. Hector and
      other notables are also there.
      Cheap goods, a box of rosaries and crucifixes made of                *
      common beads, for example, are being gone through and
      suitable junk selected for gifts.
      They talk as they work.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   How many are sick?
                                 DA CUNHA
                   About fifty, sir, some of them
                   very sick indeed. It's the eggs.
                   A couple of the crates were full of                     *
                   rotten ones, but eaten just the                         *
                   same. Others just ate too many.
                   It would have been better to ration
                   them, I suppose.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   How wise of you to think of that
                   now. Any deaths?
                                DA CUNHA
                   Six.

                                 DOM PAULO

                   Three.   I had them boiled.

                                  DOM PAULO
                   I had four.   I don't feel well

                   Four's all right... the really ill
                   ones had eaten eight, ten...

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Let's not think about it... what                        *

      Salgado comes forward with a handful of the broken
      remains of a kettle. Copper is a useful currency.
                                 SALGADO
                   It worked well... they'll go for
                   this... and nails... Luis cleaned
                   up a sackful from the crates...
      Salgado shows a handful of nails from a small sack in his
      hand.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   Organize some men to gather all                         *
                   the nails they can find. We have
                   to keep control of that particular
                   currency.
      Dom Paulo rummages in a box of cheap rosaries, selects a
      couple, and then retires to his tent. The others work
      on at the table. Hector drifts off down to the beach.


110   INT. DOM PAULO'S TENT - MORNING                                110
      Inside his tent Dom Paulo goes to his small mirror. He
      takes off the heavy silver chain and medallion from
      around his neck, and a valuable brooch from his coat. He
      stows them safely in a locked box and replaces it in its
      hiding place in the sand floor. Then he adorns himself
      in the cheap rosary and other trashy items. Dom Paulo,               *
      catching sight of his watching Son in the mirror, holds              *
      a silencing finger to his mouth.                                     *

111   EXT. BEACH - MORNING                                           111

      Hector is walking along the beach, close to a pile of                *
      discarded boxes and crates.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            89.

111   CONTINUED:                                                   111
      He quickly searches through them. He soon finds what he            *
      is looking for, a piece of wood with some nails still
      attached to it. He pulls out the nails and pockets them,
      then continues to rummage amongst the wood for more.
      Hector is a survivor. And not the first Hector to
      scavenge on a beach, in a world that feels big and empty.


112   EXT. DUNES - MORNING                                         112
      Hector is enjoying the   freshness of the day. We see              *
      him climb over a dune   and then as he nears the summit
      duck and retreat down   the slope again. Cautiously he
      crawls up the dune and   looks over to the other side.

      He is watching a young Girl and the boy Nuno. They are
      twelve or thirteen years old. They are coyly in the
      early stages of making love, the Boy lying close to the
      Girl, kissing her, beginning to caress her. Their                  *
      love-making is poised oddly between child's play and               *
      eroticism. It's their day of discovery and it is like
      a dream of love.
      The Boy is just about to   discover some more and is
      fumbling with the Girl's   clothing, when he looks up and
      catches sight of Hector.    Hector ducks down but knows he
      has been seen and decides   to brazen it out. He stands
      up in full view of them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Stop that... leave her alone...
                   get back to the camp... or I'll tell
                   your mother... how can you play like
                   this when there are people needing
                   your help back there...?
      The Boy is standing now and fixing his clothing. He walks
      off back to the camp. The Girl remains sitting in the
      sand, buttoning her dress, too embarrassed even to raise
      her head to Hector.

      Then Hector is touched by something, perhaps the sad stoop
      in the Boy's shoulder or the Girl's lowered head. Hector
      realizes he has broken something precious and in their
      circumstances infinitely fragile and irretrievable. He
      feels like an oaf. He calls after the Boy.

                                 HECTOR
                   Come back... I didn't mean it...
                   it was a joke... you come back...
                   she's still here... I won't say
                   anything...
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               90.

      But the Boy walks on, turning around now and then to look
      at Hector, who feels foolish and mean. Hector calls down
      to the Girl.
                                HECTOR
                   I'm sorry.

      But she doesn't look up, still fumbling with her buttons.
      Hector curses quietly and looks out across the dunes,
      angry with himself. Then he sees the procession of the               *
      Native King and his people, some cattle, and porters
      carrying baskets.
      Hector runs off towards the camp.


113   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                            113
      The meeting of the two leaders is weird and wonderful                *
      to see. The ragged Europeans, already scanning the                   *
      baskets of the Natives for signs of solid food,
      somehow still muster an absurd sense of their own                    *
      importance for the occasion. The Natives, excited and                *
      curious, trying to contain their exuberance so that they             *
      don't miss a single detail of this most significant
      day. Many of the Natives have climbed into the trees,                *
      either out of timidity or to get a better view                       *

      The trees around the meeting place are dripping with
      bodies, like human fruit.
      Hector slips into the crowd as the NATIVE KING is in
      mid-speech. When he has stopped talking the Slave begins
      to haltingly translate.
                                 SLAVE
                   He was excited when he heard you
                   had come, but he wants to know
                   if you are real people... he
                   didn't think you would be such
                   a strange color... so he wants
                   to see your...
      He points repeatedly at his navel.                                   *

                                 SLAVE
                   ... so that he will know that you
                   were born like real people...

                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                            91.

113   CONTINUED:                                                   113
      Dom Paulo won't suffer the indignity alone.    He talks to
      the Officers standing closest to him.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Right... you four as well...

      He begins to open up his coat and shirt. The four
      Officers do the same. The King and a few of his atten-
      dants take a step or two forward and peer at the exposed
      white European bellies. They look at one another and
      mumble solemnly. Then they step back. Dom Paulo and the
      Officers fix their clothing and re-muster their dignity.
      The King is enjoying himself.    He speaks again to the
      Slave, who then translates.

                                 SLAVE
                   He wants to see you breathe.
      The King takes a deep breath, then nods to Dom Paulo.
      Dom Paulo and the Officers do as they are told. The King
      joins them, and for a few moments there is a kind of
      communion between them. Then everyone joins in. It is a            *
      strange, poignant moment, all the Natives and all the
      Europeans united in the simple act of breathing.
      Dom Paulo regains his composure.    He speaks to the Slave.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   Tell him that we want to trade
                   with him, to buy food... and we
                   want him to guide us out of here...
                   we have a long way to travel... to
                   where the white men have their
                   big ships...
      The Slave speaks to the King. The King listens and talks
      back for a long time. Then the Slave translates again.
                                 SLAVE
                   He has heard of white men very,                       *
                   very far away... this way...
                   but you have to cross many rivers...
                   twenty big rivers...

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Tell him I want to give him these...
      Dom Paulo steps forward to the King. An Officer brings             *
      a wrapped cloth. Dom Paulo opens it, letting the King
      see the pieces of broken copper inside.
                                                                         *

      The Officer produces a handful of large nails and
      gives them directly to the King. The King nods his
      head in approval and shows the nails to his attendants.
      They are impressed.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   ... and tell him that I want to
                   make him a very special gift as
                   one King to another...
      Various Officers raise their eyebrows at this.

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Of these precious things, which my
                   fathers and forefathers have worn
                   for many long years before...

      Dom Paulo solemnly and without a blush removes the cheap
      rosary from around his neck and offers it to the King.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   I shouldn't do this, but it is
                   such a special occasion, and he is
                   such a great and worthy King...
      This is translated.    The King refuses to accept the               *
      rosary. Instead he    is pointing to a couple of chunky
      and valuable-looking   rings on Dom Paulo's fingers which
      he has forgotten to   remove.
                                 SLAVE
                   He says he could not accept such
                   a treasured gift, something of
                   such value to your family...
                   instead he would be happy to take
                   one or two of the old rings you have
                   on your fingers... but please do
                   not insist that he take your
                   necklace...
      It is impossible to know if the King is being naively
      polite or hugely clever. Dom Paulo's Officers enjoy a
      muted titter as he peels off his precious rings and
      gives them to the King, replacing the worthless baubles
      around his own neck. The King begins talking again.
      The Slave translates.

                   He will give you guides to help                        *
                   you across the first of the big
                   rivers... it is ten days from
                   here...

                                 DOM PAULO
                   Thank you, thank you...

      The Slave continues.
                                 SLAVE
                   ... and he asks you to be ready
                   to leave the beach in two days
                   time... he cannot permit you to
                   stay longer...

      Dom Paulo looks shocked.
                                 SLAVE
                   Because with the new moon the
                   turtles will arrive and lay
                   their eggs... you may frighten
                   them... you must be gone...
      The mention of turtles' eggs almost turns the stomachs
      of most of the survivors, even the fit ones.
      The King and his followers walk back into the forest.               *
      Soon the survivors are alone again, with the lost-
      looking cow the Natives have left. A doomed cow if
      ever there was.


114   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                          114
      The remains of the cow hang on the spit over the large
      fire the survivors have made on the beach. Small groups
      of people sit around it, gnawing on the roasted flesh.
      The image is once again timeless, the elements of it
      simple; man, fire, flesh, food.
      One cow doesn't go far between a hundred starving people.
      Some are still on their feet by the large fire. Now and
      then a hand will dart out over the flames to snatch a
      bone hanging loose or a tasty-looking piece of gristle.
      They are the survivors of the pack, if any will be.

      Hector is, of course, among them. He    risks the searing
      heat to pull at a couple of blackened   bones. He sees
      Nuno, the boy he chased away from the   Girl earlier in
      the day. Nuno is sitting by himself,    staring vacantly
      at the fire, licking his fingers.
      Hector sits down in the sand beside him. Nuno hardly
      notices him until Hector offers him one of his bones.
      Nuno grabs it.

                                NUNO
                   Thanks.

                                 HECTOR
                   Suck out the marrow... it's the
                   best bit.
      Nuno follows Hector's example. Hector allows him to
      feel the benefit of his gift before he starts to talk.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'm sorry about today...
                                 NUNO
                   It doesn't matter...
                                 HECTOR
                   But it does... it was mean of
                   me... I was upset at something...
                   I wasn't really angry at you...
                                 NUNO
                   I know.
      Nuno is taking it rather well.      Hector regains his
      natural self-confidence.                                             *
                                                                           *
                                 HECTOR
                   You don't think too badly of me?
                                 NUNO
                   No...
                                 HECTOR
                   You still like me?
      Nuno shyly nods his head.
                                                                           *
                                 HECTOR
                   You do?

                                 NUNO
                   Yes.

      Hector is satisfied now.
                                 HECTOR
                   Well, that makes me feel better...
                   we all have to like each other...
                   and respect each other... that's
                   important too.
      They are silent for a moment.

                                 HECTOR
                   If you don't respect me, just
                   say so...

      Nuno looks at him, smiling weakly. Then he turns away
      in silence. Hector tries another approach to win the
      Boy over.
                                 HECTOR
                   I have a boy like you... maybe                          *
                   you could meet him when we get
                   home...
      This doesn't produce much of a response. Hector tries
      again. He starts to chuckle to himself and nudges Nuno
      in the ribs.
                                 HECTOR
                   You can take her back there
                   tomorrow, eh?

      Nuno shakes his head.
                                 NUNO
                   No... she's sick now...

      Dom Paulo and the Priest and some of the Officers are
      having a more formal meal at Dom Paulo's table outside
      his shelter. An argument is in progress between Dom
      Paulo and GASPAR DIAS, the navigator.
      Gasper Dias has drawn a rough map which lies on the
      table.
                                                                           *

                   Can't you be more accurate?
      Hector comes to the meeting. He sits down on a box
      near the table and watches and listens, his expression
      changing with the shifts in mood of the others. This                 *
      is Hector the social animal, our Hector with his pockets             *
      full of stolen nails and his tent full of stashes of
      food.
                                 DIAS
                   How can I be accurate without
                   instruments? As it is I'm
                   sighting the sun with two pieces
                   of wood... Call it five hundred
                   and be done with it... he said                          *

                                 DOM PAULO
                   We just want you to be as accurate
                   as we know you can be, Dias. After
                   all, the ship did manage to find
                   that rock with admirable precision.

                                 DIAS
                   Confound you, Dom Paulo, that's an
                   insult... she hit that rock because
                   she was taking water and
                   unsteerable... She was overloaded
                   before she left India and you know
                   it....
      Dias pounds his fist on the table.

                                   DIAS
                   I've told   you... we vote for a                         *
                   leader or   you can walk into the
                   jungle on   your own... it should
                   have been   done days ago...
                                 DA CUNHA
                   Calm down, Dias... you can't stay
                   here forever, living on turtles'
                   eggs...
      There are mock groans and laughter at the thought of it.
      The tension for the moment is broken.                                 *
                                 DA CUNHA
                   What about the sick and the
                   injured, Dom Paulo...?

      Dom Paulo lets out a heavy sigh.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   I've discussed it with Father
                   Diogo... I don't see how a hundred
                   of us can carry seventy sick...

                                 FATHER DIOGO
                   I'm going to search the scriptures
                   tonight. I'm sure that God has
                   an answer to it.

                                 DIAS
                   An excuse, you mean... we'll be
                   leaving them here to die...

                   It might be the best we can offer
                   them now... the chance to die a
                   good Christian death here, and set
                   an example to the heathens...

      Hector is   making his way in the dark back to his shelter.
      He passes   close to the tent of Francisco and Ursula.
      Francisco   is outside, by the fire. An impulse takes
      Hector to   join him.
                                 HECTOR
                   I'll be glad when we're on the
                   move... the sound of the sea is
                   driving me mad.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Good night, Hector...
      Hector lingers.

                                 HECTOR
                   Where is Ursula? Sleeping?
                                 FRANCISCO
                   Sick. She hasn't been able to
                   rise since yesterday.
                                                                           *
      Hector's face expresses his shock. From what he has
      heard at the meeting this is serious news. He makes a
      decision. He speaks to Francisco, willing their old
      friendship back into existence in the urgency of the
      moment.

                                 HECTOR
                   Will you share a bottle of wine
                   with me? I've had it since we
                   left the ship... I want to drink
                   it tonight, with you.
      This offer has found a chink in Francisco's armor.

                   You have a bottle of wine?

117   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                               117
      Hector has returned with his precious bottle. Francisco
      by some miracle has two fine crystal glasses. As they
      drink they begin to reveal a hint of their old intimacy.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   You should hang for this. Some
                   people on the raft might have
                   lived with a glass of this in
                   their stomach...
      Francisco sips the wine with the relish of long
      abstinence.
                                 HECTOR
                   I know. I feel very guilty.    I
                   brought this too...

      Hector pulls a cotton bag from under his coat.

                                 HECTOR
                   Honeyed fruit. The last I have.
      Francisco can't believe such food still exits.       He
      smiles in anticipation.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   You rogue... give it here...

      Francisco grabs at the bag and stuffs two or three
      sweets into his mouth, not so much the gentleman now.

                                 HECTOR
                   I brought it for Ursula...
      Francisco talks through his munching.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Much too rich for her... do you want
                   to kill her?

                                 HECTOR
                   Surely... some fruit couldn't...

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Don't argue with me, old friend...
                   you're the guilty one around here,
                   and don't you forget it.
                                 HECTOR
                   Why is it always me? Why am I
                   always guilty, always sorry... am
                   I so bad?
                                   FRANCISCO
                   With   Ursula you weren't bad, you
                   were   stupid... you did the one thing
                   you   can't do to a strong woman...
                   you   took away her pride... what else
                   can   she do but hate you?

      Hector is silent.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   And then you get on the same ship...
                   what a fool...
                                 HECTOR
                   I had to get home... just like you...
                                 FRANCISCO
                   And when the ship went down... why
                   did you have to get on the same
                   raft... it was as if you were trying
                   to torment her...
                                 HECTOR
                   But... the other raft was sinking...
                                  FRANCISCO                               *
                   So?                                                    *

                                 HECTOR                                   *
                   Francisco... please...                                 *

      Francisco's face breaks into a smile. They drink the                *
      rest of the bottle in silence, the complexity of their              *
      friendship having gone beyond words.                                *

118   EXT. MASS - DAY                                               118

      On a headland overlooking the bay, Father Diogo's mass is
      in progress. Every fit member of the camp is there, and
      a good many of the sick have been carried in litters to
      take part. The harmonium has been carried up the hill
      and is in full voice, some youths dissipating their
      precious energy on its bellows. The younger boys have
      been organized into a choir.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

      The large cross stands behind Father Diogo, held     in place
      by a cairn of piled stones at its base. When we      FIND
      Hector there is something tantalizingly familiar     about it
      all; the cliffs, the ocean, the kneeling Hector,     a pile
      of stones, the offering to a god.
                                                                           *

119   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                           119
      The natives have gathered nearby. They have been moved,              *
      perhaps by the music, or perhaps by the simple, universal            *
      posture of worship itself. They begin to sing, a low,
      rhythmic, compelling chant. It mingles with the distant
      voice of Father Diogo, and then with the chanting voices
      of all the Europeans, until it seems that the whole
      world is praying.


120   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                           120
      Next morning the camp on the beach     is being broken up.
      The place is like a junkyard. The      amount of damage that
      a hundred and fifty people can do     to a beach in two days
      is impressive. Dom Paulo and the      officers watch the work.
      With them are some messengers from     the king, and the
      Slave translator.
      One of the messengers is talking.     When he finishes, the
      Slave translates.
                                 SLAVE
                   Yes... they will look after the
                   sick... but the King would like
                   one thing... the machine that
                   makes music...
                                 DOM PAULO
                   We need food as well... ten
                   cows... to take with us... then
                   the King can have the music.


121   EXT. CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - MORNING                           121    *
      Hector is sitting beside Nuno on a box, talking earnestly
      to him. Andre stands beside them.
                                                                           *
                                 HECTOR
                   You must come with us.

                   No.

                   Your mother might not get well...
                   do you understand that?
                                 NUNO
                   That's why I have to stay.

                                 HECTOR
                   And afterwards... what will you
                   do then?

                                 NUNO
                   Follow you and the others.
                                 HECTOR
                   Alone?

      Nuno remains silent.
                                 ANDRE
                   Let him be.


122   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                               122
      Dom Paulo and Father Diogo are standing beside Dom                    *
      Paulo's table, all that remains of his headquarters on                *
      the beach.

                                 FATHER DIOGO
                   I'll comfort them as best as I
                   can.
                                 DOM PAULO
                   You're staying with them?
      Father Diogo hastens to correct this misunderstanding.

                                 FATHER DIOGO
                   No, no, I'll comfort them before
                   we leave. I think my place is
                   with you...
      Two sailors, like stagehands, enter and remove the table,
      leaving Dom Paulo and Father Diogo propless on the beach.


123   EXT. JUNGLE PATH - DAY                                        123
      The trek from the beach to the village has started. A
      long line of people, including some local natives, carry
      the sick in crudely-made litters. Even this short trip
      is hard.  Somewhere in the line six sailors manhandle the
      harmonium up the jungle path.

123   CONTINUED:                                                    123
      Just behind   them Hector is helping Nuno to carry his
      Mother in a   litter. It is like a civilization on the
      move. In a    day or two the wind and the sea will have
      rubbed out   all evidence of their stay, and the bay will
      welcome its   regular tenants, the turtles.


124   EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE - DAY                                   124
      There is a sense of bustle in the native village as the
      European sick are settled into their huts and the others
      prepare to depart. Emotional farewells take place in                *
      dark corners of the small huts. A group of unmoved
      sailors are playing cards in the dirt.                              *

      In amongst the bustle Hector is looking for Francisco.
      He finds him taking some of his possessions into a hut.             *
                                 HECTOR
                   Francisco... I have to see her                         *
                   before we leave.
                                   FRANCISCO
                   I'll ask her.
      Francisco goes into the hut. Hector waits outside,
      watching the small human dramas all around him. Soon
      Francisco emerges from the hut.

                                   FRANCISCO
                   In you go.
      Hector goes into the hut, stooping low at the small
      entrance.


125   INT. HUT - DAY                                              125

      Ursula is lying in a darkened corner. Hector is shaken
      by the sight of her, ashen and fevered, but tries not to
      show it. He kneels beside her.

                                 HECTOR
                   Ursula... it's Hector.

      She turns her eyes to him but doesn't speak.

                                 HECTOR
                   We're leaving soon. I've come to
                   say goodbye...

      Her voice is a whisper.

                   I won't forget you... I won't
                   forget India... I can't forget
                   how I hurt you...

      She looks at him but doesn't or cannot speak.
                                 HECTOR
                   We should have talked... I could
                   have explained... many things...
      She manages a whispered word.

                                  URSULA
                   Lisbon...
                                 HECTOR
                   Yes... I'll pray for you in
                   Lisbon... at the Cathedral...
      She lies still.       Hector lingers for a moment.   Then he
      speaks again.
                                 HECTOR
                   I'm sorry I hurt your pride...

      Hector has blown it. Ursula pulls herself up on an
      elbow, finding wells of energy from sheer indignation.
      Hector is astonished, almost jumping out of his skin.
                                 URSULA
                   What? What did you say?    What are
                   you talking about?

                                 HECTOR
                   Nothing, nothing...
      Ursula speaks one word, and then falls back into a dead
      faint.
                                  URSULA
                   Idiot!

      She lies still. Hector leans over her to make sure she
      is still breathing. He whispers nervously.
                                  HECTOR
                   Ursula?

                                                            104.

126   EXT. HUT - DAY                                             126
      Outside the hut, Dom Paulo is talking with Francisco.

                              DOM PAULO
                We won't forget you, or what you
                are doing for these poor people...

                              FRANCISCO
                I'm not staying here with the
                intention of dying, Dom Paulo...
                we'll be following you... when we
                are fit and well...

                              DOM PAULO
                Yes, of course...

                              FRANCISCO
                ... and good luck to you...                            *
      They make what they both know is their final parting.            *
                              DOM PAULO
                God protect you... it breaks my                        *
                heart to leave you all here, but
                I don't know what else I can do.
      They shake hands.
                              DOM PAULO
                We're leaving the cross with
                you...

                Oh, thank you...

                              DOM   PAULO
                It's too heavy to   carry... and who
                knows... it might   make some
                impression on the   heathens.
      Hector comes out of the hut, solemn-faced.                       *

                              HECTOR
                Francisco, I must talk to you
                alone...


127   EXT. HUT - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                             127
      Hector takes Francisco by the arm and leads him behind
      the hut.

                              FRANCISCO
                You've made your peace with her?
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                105.

                                  HECTOR
                   Yes.   I think so...                                      *

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Thank, God... Well, goodbye.                              *

                                 HECTOR
                   Is there anything that I can do
                   for you? A letter... a message?                           *
      Francisco laughs softly.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   No... if you were carrying                                *
                   something for me I would have to
                   worry about you... if you go
                   empty-handed I can put you out of
                   my mind!
      Hector smiles uncertainly, unsure if Francisco is making
      a joke. Then he becomes more serious.
                                 HECTOR
                   I want to ask you something.                              *
                   There's no easy way to do it...
                                 FRANCISCO
                   Go on, Hector...

                                   HECTOR
                   Your boots...
      Francisco looks down at his boots.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   What about them?

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I have them? You can have
                   mine... they'll be fine for
                   here... but I have to walk six
                   hundred miles...
      Hector lifts a foot to show Francisco his boot. Francisco
      is stunned into silence. But then a smile comes to his                 *
      face.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   Yes, you're right... I daresay                            *
                   my boots would take you six hundred                       *
                   miles... I look after them...

      Hector becomes almost poetic in his pleading.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'll walk all the way home,
                   Francisco... I'll pray for your
                   soul in the Cathedral in Lisbon...

                   Yes.

      Francisco starts to laugh out loud.
                                 FRANCISCO
                   Hector, you have surpassed
                   yourself... sit down and take my
                   boots!
      Francisco starts to take off his boots. Hector does the             *
      same. He can't believe his luck. At this moment, he                 *
      loves Francisco. He makes nonsensical small talk,
      hopping around on one foot.
                                 HECTOR
                   They were made by Da Fosca,
                   weren't they?
      Francisco is giggling now.

                                 FRANCISCO
                   The best bootmaker in Goa... pray
                   for my soul in Lisbon, Hector...
                   and pray for your own...

      Francisco is laughing, but Hector doesn't get the joke.
                                                                          *

128   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                             128
      A different forest. A wilderness of giant pines, ranging
      through the mountains for hundred of miles. It is late              *
      in the year. There is one human sound in the cold still-            *
      ness, a voice singing.
      BOBBY, the owner of the voice, has a pack on his back.              *
      He is making his way up a steep slope to an area of flat
      ground. He stops singing, looks around, and calls out               *
      in a powerful voice.                                                *
                                 BOBBY
                   They've gone... long gone!

      Bobby looks around the abandoned camp, the dead fires,              *
      cleared areas for tents.

      Up the slope and INTO VIEW comes his companion, leading
      a laden pack horse. It is Hector.

                                  HECTOR
                   How long?

                                 BOBBY
                   They've been gone a week, at
                   least.
                                  HECTOR
                   Damn them...
                                 BOBBY
                   We're ten days late...

      They look at each other.      They are in trouble, and now
      they know it.
                                 BOBBY
                   Cheer up. Have a look around.
                   I'll start on a fire...


129   EXT. CAMPSITE - DAY                                           129
      Hector has scoured the campsite.      He holds up a canteen
      he has found.

                                 HECTOR
                   It's Sandy's... whiskey...
                                 BOBBY
                   Well done, my lad!
      Hector walks to the fire, pleased with     himself. Bobby
      unfolds his fist and looks at what he     has found, an
      Indian arrowhead with a few inches of     broken shaft. He
      folds his hand over it again, keeping     his secret.
      Behind them, nailed to a tree, is a plaque their
      companions have left. It reads, "Pennsylvania Boundary
      Expedition 1761, Marker 152." Also on the plaque someone
      has written, "We left here, 20th October."


130   EXT. CAMP - NIGHT                                             130
      Hector and Bobby sit by the fire with their supper.      They
      are both anxious, but pretend not to be.

                   Even if we lose their track, we'll
                   still hit the river... we can't
                   miss that.
                                 HECTOR
                   It's too high for Indians?

                                 BOBBY
                   Much too high. You won't find an
                   Indian up here. We just have to
                   keep our heads... no panic.
                                 HECTOR
                   If you did find an Indian, what
                   would he be?

                                 BOBBY
                   You wouldn't... but he might be a
                   Delaware if you did.
                                 HECTOR
                   We keep working?

                                 BOBBY
                   Why not. We can log the peaks on
                   the far side, just a couple of
                   sightings a day... keep us busy...

      Their forced tone of matter-of-factness only serves to
      heighten the growing feeling of doom.
                                 HECTOR
                   You think we'll get out?
                                 BOBBY
                   If we keep our heads.   I wish I
                   had some tobacco.

131   EXT. CAMP - ANOTHER ANGLE - NIGHT                        131

      Hector is lying awake, watching Bobby's sleeping form on
      the ground at the other side of the dying fire. Behind
      Bobby is a wolf, sniffing and edging his way closer to
      them. Hector isn't anxious. He knows the wolf will soon
      become aware of them and move off. He is worried about
      something else. From under the pack that makes his
      pillow he pulls a piece of broken arrow, a shaft and some
      feathers, the other end of Bobby's find. He looks at it,
      then looks back to Bobby and the wolf.

                                                            109.

132   EXT. CAMP - MORNING                                        132
      In the morning Hector and Bobby are taking readings from
      the instruments they have hung on a large tree, main-
      taining the disciplines of their work. It gives some
      shape and meaning to their predicament.
                              BOBBY
                Barometer... twenty-eight and
                three-eighths... temperature...                        *
                low... thirty-four... high...
                forty-two and a half... time...

      Hector writes it in the log book. Bobby goes to the              *
      horse and takes a brass chronometer from a box strapped
      to the saddle. Hector takes out a smaller chronometer
      from his own pack. They compare readings. There is a
      difference of some four or five minutes in the time.

                              BOBBY
                It's getting worse... you're
                nearly five minutes fast now...
                              HECTOR
                I'm not fast... you're slowing
                down.
      They obviously have this tiff every morning.
                              HECTOR
                What's the point of having two
                chronometers when you don't take
                the average?
                              BOBBY
                Exactly... you should throw yours
                away.
                              HECTOR
                You're unscientific, Bobby... at
                heart...
      Hector writes in the book.   He speaks pointedly.

                              HECTOR
                Seven twenty-five...

      Bobby mocks him with a laugh.                                    *

133   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          133

      Bobby is leading the horse and Hector walks on ahead.            *
      The going is easy through the ferns and grasses. Bobby           *
      for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing
      loudly.

                   I see her in the dewy flowers
                   I see her sweet and fair...
      His voice rings sharply around the forest. Hector far
      ahead turns around, taken by surprise. Bobby has
      frightened himself too. He eyes the forest all around
      as the echo of his voice fades. Chastened, he begins
      to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath.
                                 BOBBY
                   There's not a bonny bird that sings
                   But minds me o' my Jean...

134   EXT. CLEARING - DAY                                        134

      Hector and Bobby have stopped at a point of bare rock
      looking out across the broad valley.
      They are building a pile of stones, a cairn. They work
      quietly, methodically. The only sounds are of their
      breathing and the CLICK-CLACK of the stones. We feel the
      echoes of our many previous Hectors and their piles of
      stones, built for this or that purpose. Our doomed
      surveyors are acting out the same ritual, this time in
      the name of science.
      They finish the cairn and erect their heavy tripod over
      it, and dangle a plumb line from the tripod. Bobby
      scratches the center point on the top stone of the cairn.
      They are establishing a survey point. They talk as they
      work.

      When they anchor their   tripod, the cold hard sound of
      their CHISELS STRIKING   ROCK ECHOES all through the forest.
      It unnerves them. They    stop hammering and listen to the
      ECHO BOUNCING down the   valley.
                                 HECTOR
                   Sure this is a good idea.

                                 BOBBY
                   Let's get out of here.

      They hastily dismantle the equipment and load up the
      horse, in an atmosphere of controlled panic.

135   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          135

      They are travelling together now, on either side of the
      horse's nose, finding comfort in the closeness of each
      other. They stop for Bobby to consult his compass.

      He indicates a slight change of direction, and they move
      off again. Still they don't talk. We can feel their
      anxiety breeding in the silence. Why don't they talk?
      They proceed in this weighty silence, but even the CRIES
      of the BIRDS now seem to mock them.

      The route takes them downhill. The slopes are more dense
      with undergrowth now and the going isn't so easy. Some-
      times they are reduced to an undignified scramble, hanging
      onto the bulk of the horse between them. They no longer
      look much like conquerors of the wilderness.

      They are on the valley floor now. The trees are more
      openly spaced and the grass is richer. They are moving
      quickly but they have a hard time keeping the horse on
      the trot. It hasn't seen grass this good in weeks.

137   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                            137

      They are moving more slowly, the ground is rockier and
      the trees are thickening. They take the easy way up the
      hillside, a natural path made by deer or bear.
      It is difficult to know who is more shaken by their
      encounter, the Indian or Hector and Bobby.
      The INDIAN is sitting behind a tree as they pass, dozing
      or deep in reverie. They almost pass without noticing
      him, but Hector gives a turn of his head and there is the
      Indian four feet from him. At the same instant the Indian
      comes to his senses and sits bolt upright. The encounter
      is high comedy but full of terror for all of them.

      The Indian stands up.       Hector absurdly greets him.
                                   HECTOR
                   Hi!   Hello!
      The Indian backs off from them, holding his hands up and
      smiling crazily, as if to say, "Don't mind me, boys, I'm
      just leaving..." Hector and Bobby are equally silly in
      their response.
                                 HECTOR
                   Hey, come back... we're just
                   moving through... don't
                   apologize... we all got a fright...
                   goodbye...
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                112.         *

      The Indian is in full retreat now, waving his hands about
      apologetically, but making good distance from them.
      Suddenly, he is gone. It has happened so quickly that
      Hector and Bobby scarcely believe it has happened. Then
      they realize that in their fright they have let go of the
      horse. It has headed back down to the tastier pastures
      in the valley. They see it disappearing into the trees
      below them.
                                 BOBBY
                   That was stupid...

                                 HECTOR
                   Did you see him?

                                 BOBBY
                   Sure I saw him.
                                 HECTOR
                   Was he a Delaware?
                                 BOBBY
                   How the fuck should I know? He
                   was an Indian... and Indians don't
                   come in ones...
                                 HECTOR
                   Yeah... I think he was an Indian
                   too... What about the horse?
                                 BOBBY
                   I'm not going back down there.
                                 HECTOR
                   Don't panic, Bobby...
                                BOBBY
                   Why not?
      He runs off into the forest.        Then he turns and shouts to
      Hector.

                                BOBBY
                   Come on!

      Hector follows him, a mad race through the forest.

138   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                             138

      Hector and Bobby are sitting on a rock, gathering their
      wits. It is odd how they talk so matter-of-factly.
                                 HECTOR
                   What did you see?

                   Same as you.

                                 HECTOR
                   An Indian... with long hair...

                                 BOBBY
                   That's it... kind of short...
                                 HECTOR
                   Yeah... he was't tall...

                                 BOBBY
                   That's the one.

      Hector scans the hills above them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Let's get a bit further up.
      They move off.     Bobby looks at Hector's backpack.
                                 BOBBY
                   What've you got in there?
                                 HECTOR
                   Some food, the logbooks, my
                   letters, a candle...

                                  BOBBY
                   A gun?
                                  HECTOR
                   No.


139   EXT. CAMP - DAY                                        139

      They have stopped to make camp. It is late afternoon,
      the sky just darkening, sharp shadows on the far peaks, a
      purple glow in the air.

                                 BOBBY
                   We won't have a fire tonight. We
                   should make a shelter though, in
                   case it snows.

                                 HECTOR
                   What about bears, without a fire?

      Bobby laughs quietly.

                                 BOBBY
                   Don't even think about bears, Hector.

                                                            114.       *

      They are making a round frame of bent branches and cover-
      ing it with foliage. Half-hidden in the undergrowth, it
      is big enough for two men to huddle in. Tonight they feel
      the most basic of urges, to curl up in a ball and hide.

141   INT. CAMP - NIGHT                                          141

      They are safe and snug in their hideaway. Hector has lit
      his candle. He is reading his letters, holding them close
      to his eyes in the dimness. He has the air of someone
      putting his affairs in order. Bobby is thinking aloud.
                              BOBBY
                Maybe he's lost too... on his
                own... must be Delaware... they
                were chased up here years ago...
                everybody thought they'd cleared
                off west... the other side of
                Ohio... they were an angry lot...
                no wonder... they used to farm on
                the coast.
      He looks up at Hector, and allows himself a small smile.
                              BOBBY
                Go on, read it out...
      Hector looks up.
                                 HECTOR
                What?     No... not tonight...
                              BOBBY
                I've had to listen to it every
                night since April... why not now?

      Hector gives in. He holds a scrap of paper close to the
      candle and reads.
                              HECTOR
                Dear, Father, I miss you. Three
                frogs are dead. Everybody misses
                you.  Bring me a bear's head and
                claws and a gun. School is good.
                Miss White has married a fireman.
                Come back soon. Do not worry
                about the frogs, they did not
                have names. Nathaniel.

      Hector looks up at Bobby.

                              HECTOR
                It's not so funny now as it was.

                   It wasn't funny then.

                                 HECTOR
                   If you knew him... if you could
                   picture him saying it... it would
                   be funnier.

                                 BOBBY
                   I had a father like you... nine
                   months on a whaler and then three
                   weeks at home telling us all how
                   much he missed us...
                                 HECTOR
                   I'm going home, for the winter...

      Bobby doesn't pursue his argument.    He tenses, then
      sniffs the air vigorously.
                                BOBBY
                   Smell it?
                                HECTOR
                   No.

                   Goddam it... smell it?

      Hector sniffs some more.
                                HECTOR
                   Tobacco?

      They whisper.
                                 BOBBY
                   Where the hell is it coming
                   from?
      He puts his head out of the shelter.

                                 BOBBY
                   I can't tell... a night like this
                   it could carry for miles...

      He huddles back inside the shelter.
                                 BOBBY
                   I wish I had a smoke.

      After a tense silence, Hector takes a small package from
      an inside pocket. He hands it to Bobby.

                                 HECTOR
                   I was saving it... you have it...

      It is a wedge of tobacco.      Bobby takes it.

                                 BOBBY
                   What do you mean, you were saving
                   it? You know the rules... no
                   hoarding, tobacco or food... you've
                   listened to me for a month, day and
                   night... wanting a smoke...

                   I have to wait until your birthday

      There is a brooding silence.

      Hector is neatly turning the tables on Bobby, who now
      appears churlish, childish.

                                 BOBBY
                   No... I'll have it in the morning.

                                 HECTOR
                   Come on... tell me... who would
                   you rather be sitting here with...
                   have a think...

      Bobby does, and then breaks into a smile.
                                   BOBBY
                   Daniel Boone?

      Hector smiles, too.
                                 HECTOR
                   Yeah. He would be a help... but
                   after Daniel Boone...
                                 BOBBY
                   I can't think of anyone else... but
                   you're impossible to like sometimes.
      Suddenly Bobby grows shy of their growing intimacy.
                                 BOBBY
                   We should sleep. We've got a lot
                   of running to do in the morning.
      But Hector has other plans.          He is in control of their
      friendship now.
                                 HECTOR
                   No we're not... we're going to
                   talk... all night...
      Bobby yields to this with the softest, most vulnerable
      smile we have yet seen on his face.

                                 HECTOR
                   So... where do you want to start?

      Bobby is silent, but still smiles his acquiescent smile.
      Hector reads the silence well.
                                 HECTOR
                   I know where you want to start...

      Bobby is still silent.
                                   HECTOR
                   Alicia...

      Bobby's smile breaks into a boyish laugh.

                                 BOBBY
                   Well... what about Alicia?
                                  HECTOR
                   I'm sorry...

                                 BOBBY
                   No... I'm sorry...

                                 HECTOR
                   What do you mean, you're sorry...
                   I'm the one that has to apologize...

      Bobby is mischievous now.

                                 BOBBY
                   Oh no you're not...
      It will be a worthwhile night for both of them.


142   EXT. FOREST - DAWN                                          142
      It is a glorious dawn. Bobby sits looking out on the
      valley, smoking his pipe. Behind him Hector is busy
      writing in his log book.

                                 BOBBY
                   Isn't it a beautiful day?
      Hector finishes his writing, tears out the page from his
      book. He offers it to Bobby.
                                 HECTOR
                   I've said who we are and where
                   we're headed. Want to sign it,
                   write anything?
                                  BOBBY
                   No.
                                 HECTOR
                   The peak we logged yesterday...
                   I've named it Nathanial Mountain.
                   After my boy... is that fine with
                   you?
                                 BOBBY
                   I was going to call it Tobacco
                   Mountain... or Mount Alicia... but
                   Nathaniel's fine...
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                           119.         *

      Hector smiles. He puts the paper in a small leather
      pouch, puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter,
      and starts to build a small pile of protective stones
      on top of it.
      Bobby stands, and turns to watch him.

                                 BOBBY
                   Let's get away from here.
                                   HECTOR
                   North?
                                   BOBBY
                   Yeah.    Keep the sun on our backs.

      Bobby walks off with great clouds of tobacco smoke
      billowing defiantly around him, as if to challenge
      their night-time tormentor.
      Hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little
      memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with Bobby.


143   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          143
      Hector and Bobby look vulnerable as they walk through
      the open forest with their meager packs on their backs.

                                 BOBBY
                   We can move quicker without the
                   horse... we just have to keep
                   moving... we have to get away from
                   here.
      Behind them they don't see the figure moving from the
      cover of one tree to another, and then another figure
      following the first. They move like ghosts.

144   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                          144

      Bobby is a few steps ahead of Hector. He dips down
      over a rise, and instantly returns. He throws himself
      and Hector to the ground. Hector tries to struggle free.

                                   HECTOR
                   What's wrong?
                                  BOBBY
                   Quiet.   They're on the other side...

      Hector ducks lower, hugging the ground. Bobby is
      already sliding up the slope to look over the rise.
      Hector follows him.
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                                                             120.

      On the other side, they see the women and children of
      a small group of Indians at the edge of a stream. The
      women are washing clothes, the children are splashing and
      playing. We are close enough to hear their laughter.
                                 BOBBY
                   We're right in the middle of them...

                                 HECTOR
                   Does it have to be bad?   They might
                   be friendly...

                                 BOBBY
                   They were chased here... They should
                   be on the coast growing corn...

      Bobby turns to Hector to make his point. That is when he
      sees the first of the figures, just the ghost of a shadow
      moving from tree to rock. His eyes flick across the
      forest behind them. He sees another figure caught in
      the act of seeking cover, looking absurdly embarrassed
      for the fleeting moment that we see it. Then Bobby
      sees another. Are they teasing them? It looks so much
      like a game children would play.
                                   BOBBY
                   Oh-oh...                                               *
                                   HECTOR

                                 BOBBY
                   They're behind us. They must
                   think we're stalking the women...
      Hector looks and sees nothing. Fifty Indians hold their
      breath. The forest seems empty. But Hector looks at
      Bobby. He is grey-faced, a man who is looking at death.
      Hector knows they are doomed.
                                 BOBBY
                   Do you want to run?
                                 HECTOR
                   I'll do what you do.
                                                                          *
      They leap to their feet and run. There is only one
      way to go, over the rise, through the women and children
      and across the stream. To the watching Indians it looks
      like a direct attack on their families. From behind
      trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase. A
      tragedy of misunderstanding.

      Hector and Bobby scatter the women and children and
      splash across the stream, burning all their energy in               *
      this mad life-or-death race. Although their families
      are safe, the Indians keep up the chase, the moment of
      confusion compounded in action. They lope easily after
      them, waiting for the white men to tire. There are no               *
      whoops or shouts. They follow Hector and Bobby into the
      trees, spreading out on either side, shaping the human
      net that will soon engulf them.
      It is a menacing spectacle. Death is near.        Hector
      and Bobby stay close together as they run.
                                 BOBBY
                   When they catch up... fight...
                   it'll be quicker... fight like
                   hell...
                                 HECTOR
                   They're not going to catch us.
                   We're going home.
      Hector stretches out an arm to Bobby.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hold my hand, Bobby...
      They hold hands and run.

      A war party of media people surround Hector as he exits
      a Yellow Cab. He forces his way through the yelling
      crowd of REPORTERS and camera crews. Hector is trying
      to make his way into a crumbling apartment building in
      Queens. Policemen help Hector through the barrage of                *
      shouted questions.

      Hector enters the building. The media mob immediately
      switch off their energy. They light cigarettes, fiddle              *
      with cameras, stare into space, as if someone has
      shouted "Cut."

146   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         146

      Hector climbs to the fourth floor.     A POLICEMAN goes with
      him.

      Two paramedics come up the stairs behind them, carrying a
      stretcher. The Policeman stops.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   You guys are downstairs... third
                   floor... thirty-eight...
      The paramedics turn around and head back down the stairs.
      Hector looks at the Policeman curiously.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   You're forty-eight.

      They continue climbing.

      Hector and the Policeman squeeze past a cluster of people
      at the door and enter the apartment.

                   This is Troup!
      A DETECTIVE is with another man who looks like a city

                   I might have to close the place

                                   HECTOR
                   Where is she?
      The Detective and Hector walk down the hall. They stop
      at the door of the bathroom. Hector looks inside. There
      is a large ragged hole in the floor. At the far side of
      it the toilet unit dangles at a dangerous angle into the
      hole, held only by its plumbing. Firemen are working to
      secure it and what is left of the floor with metal props
      and hydraulic jacks. Lying on the floor below,
      surrounded by rubble, and being attended by the
      paramedics, is an old lady, MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS. She
      tries to sit up when she sees Hector peering at her over
      the rim of the hole. She looks angry.
                                 MR. PHILIPPOPOLIS
                   I phoned you Monday... I told you
                   the floor was making noises...
                                 HECTOR
                   Not me, Mrs. Philippopolis... my

                   to him... How are you feeling?
      Hector says this clearly, for the benefit of the
      Detective and Mr. Santiago. The Detecitve is unimpressed.

                                 DETECTIVE
                   Come back from there, Troup, the

      As if in response, Mrs. Philippopolis shouts up to
      Hector as she sees him leaving the bathroom above her.

                   sue you... you're a lousy landlord...
                   you should be ashamed... to let old
                   people live like this... I phoned
                   you Monday... I have a witness!
                   I was dancing with a prince on my
                   eighteenth birthday, and now look at
                   me... you have me falling down a
                   toilet!


148   INT. BUILDING - DAY                                         148
      Hector retreats into the hallway. Takes out his mobile
      phone and dials, while watching the ominous Mr. Santiago
      making copius notes in his book. Hector gets connected.

                                 HECTOR
                   Boris... why did you do this to
                   me? Get down here now... they
                   want all kinds of certificates...
                   They won't let me leave the
                   building... I have my kids tonight,
                   I haven't seen them in four years...
                   I did tell you, I've been talking
                   about it all week... how come they
                   phoned me, this isn't my building?
                   What? Don't tell me anymore... I
                   want you here, now... and on your
                   knee... I'll phone the lawyer...
                   but you move. My weekend's ruined
                   before it's started.

      Hector quickly dials another number.

                   Anna... thank God... you have to
                   help me... I'm still in Queens...                      *
                   I've got cops here and everything                      *
                   ... I need your car... I don't have
                   time to pick up the rental now...
                   they won't let me leave the
                   building... you come down here...
                   and put my bag in the car... no..                      *
                   I have to pick the kids up by six,
                   otherwise I fuck up her weekend
                   too... she'll kill me... this is
                   an emergency... what can I say?
                   Please... right... okay...

      He finishes the call just as Santiago approaches, waving
      his notebook now full of incriminating notes.
                                 SANTIAGO
                   It looks like water rotted the
                   floor... You have any plumbing
                   maintenance records?
                                 HECTOR
                   At the office... I might have some
                   bills... it's not my building.                         *
      Santiago is talking almost to himself now, absorbed in the
      mundane mechanics of Hector's building.
                                 SANTIAGO
                   It's a weird one... I don't know
                   how water could sit in there for
                   so long without somebody noticing
                   ... you didn't use water-resistent
                   paint on the ceilings did you?

      Hector shakes his head wearily.
                                 HECTOR
                   I don't really know...

                                 SANTIAGO
                   You're going to have to check out                      *
                   the whole building... you know
                   that, don't you?

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I do it Monday?

                                 SANTIAGO
                   Good joke... it'll take you a
                   month.

      Hector is already dialing another number as Santiago
      wanders off in search of further fascinating discoveries.

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I speak with Leonard, please...
                   Mr. Deutsch? My name is Hector
                   Troup, Borlonski and Troup, Real
                   Estate...
      There is a moment's pause.

                                 HECTOR
                   Leonard... it's Hector... Borlonski
                   and Troup... yes... listen, we've
                   had a domestic accident at our
                   Eighth Street building... a floor                     *
                   ... and an old lady... she did
                   mention the word sue, but it might
                   have been hysterics... what I need
                   to know is what certificates you
                   have on file for the building... I                    *
                   know it's Friday... just do one                       *
                   thing... let me know if the
                   insurance is current... I need to
                   know that... I'm on my mobile...
                   anything you have... before five
                   ... thank you...
      During the call Hector has walked   down the hall and back
      to the hole in the floor. He sees    Mrs. Philippopolis,
      now strapped in a stretcher, being   carried out of the
      room below. At the sight of him,    she tries to sit up,
      straining on her straps.

                                 MRS. PHILIPPOPOLIS
                   My son's downstairs... when he
                   sees me like this he'll kill you...
                   go on... jump through the hole...
                   see what it feels like! Break both
                   legs!

      Hector is almost tempted to do what she says.

149   INT. BUILDING - ANOTHER ANGLE - DAY                          149

      Hector is following the paramedics as they negotiate
      Mrs. Philippopolis down the three flights of stairs.
      He is on the phone again. This time to his former wife.

                   I'll be on the way in thirty
                   minutes at the outside... I can't
                   say... Queens to New Jersey, on

                   away from problems... as soon as
                   I get the car... I'll be there...
      All the while Mrs. Philippopolis issues a non-stop                    *
      torrent of Greek expletives -- calmly and in a considered             *
      tone, but obviously obscene. Hector is shocked.                       *

      On a street Hector stands with a Policeman watching                   *
      Mrs. Philippopolis being loaded into the ambulance. Her
      SON is with her. When she is safely inside he walks
      towards Hector. Fortunately he is of modest build, and
      a head shorter than Hector, and he seems to be saving
      his wrath for the Courthouse.
                                 SON
                   Mr. Troup, I'm George
                   Philippopolis.
      They shake hands.
                                 HECTOR
                   I'm sorry about your mother...

                   Well... it's happened... you want
                   to travel with us, or do you have
                   a car?

                   her family with her now... Any
                   other Friday but this one.

      The Son addresses the Policeman.

                                 SON
                   He's not coming to the hospital...

      The Policeman looks at Hector.
                                 POLICEMAN
                   That could look bad...

      The cop is enjoying his role as straight man to these
      two. Hector takes out his diary.
                                 HECTOR
                   Look, George... here's what I can
                   do... I'll visit her on Tuesday,
                   I'll organize some flowers...
                   lots...                                                  *

                   who's gonna pay? It's your
                   building that fell down...

      He nods his head to the Policeman.
                                 HECTOR
                   They won't let me leave here...
      The Policeman this time backs him up.

                                  POLICEMAN
                   That's true.

      The Son backs off to the waiting ambulance reluctantly.

                   Deutsch is checking the

                   a thing... it might   help if you

                   I'm sorry, Hector... I   just put
                   your name on the lousy   forms... I
                   didn't plan this... I   just
                   borrowed your name on   the titles.
      Hector doesn't let up on his anger.

                                 HECTOR
                   I told you to stop doing that...

                   you remember that?
                   Boris Borlonski!

      Boris is conciliatory.

                   Hector... forgive me... I'll take
                   care of it... don't let it spoil
                   your weekend... four years, huh?
                   You make the most of it... and
                   don't worry, you'll walk away

      relationship, despite Boris's pranks.

                   to get out of this business... I
                   thought I had...
                                 BORIS
                   Go on... have a great weekend...
                   I'll talk to you on Monday... we'll
                   straighten everything out...
                                 HECTOR
                   This is the worst it's been.
                                 BORIS
                   Everything can be fixed... always.

      Then Hector's girl friend ANNA arrives in her car. It is
      a bright pink station wagon, highly decorated with flower
      motifs and slogans like "ANNA'S ARRANGEMENTS," and "FRESH
      OR DRY, WE'LL PLEASE THE EYE." Anna is a florist.
      Hector brightens when he sees her. Everything is falling
      into place. All he has to do now is cross two rivers
      and Manhatan Island in under an hour, in Anna's pink car.
      He runs to meet her.
                                 ANNA
                   Get in... you can dropp me at the
                   shop.
      Hector gets into the car, smiling broadly.


152   INT. CAR - DAY                                                152
      Anna drives skilfully through the busy Friday streets.

                                 HECTOR
                   You bring my bag?
                                 ANNA
                   Yeah. Your camera's in there too.
                   Take some photographs of the
                   kids...

                                  HECTOR
                   Sure.   Thanks.
                                 ANNA
                   Nervous?

                                 HECTOR
                   Not much... just like I'm being
                   executed...
                                 ANNA
                   Well you deserve to suffer.

      Our Hectors have been hearing this for centuries, but at
      least Anna smiles when she says it.
                                 ANNA
                   Don't worry... this is the
                   beginning of something... not the
                   end... you can start being a
                   father again.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'm glad you talked me into it.
                                 ANNA
                   I didn't do much... you were
                   ready...
                                 HECTOR
                   You're right... you're absolutely
                   right... I was ready... I am
                   ready, for everything... I'm
                   fixing all that shit with Boris...
                   I told him... it can't go on...
                   I want my freedom.
      Anna is looking at him amusedly, nodding her head with
      every earnest pronouncement that he makes.

                                 HECTOR
                   ... and the kids... that'll work
                   out... we can have them over
                   sometimes... Yeah?
                                 ANNA
                   Sure... that was the plan... when
                   we have the space...
                                 HECTOR
                   Right, when we have the space...
                   when we get the bigger apartment...
                   together...
                                 ANNA
                   There you go... you said it...
                   the bigger apartment together...

      Hector is pleased with himself.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                   Yeah... I said it, didn't I?

                                 ANNA
                   You're a man of decision,
                   Hector...

      Hector is high on his optimism now, and cheeky with it.
                                 HECTOR
                   Yes I am... Together... I said it
                   ... and get out of my car at the
                   corner here... I don't have the
                   time to go 'round the block.

      Anna pulls into the curb. Hector leans over to embrace
      her before she has stopped the car.
                                 HECTOR
                   Thanks... for the car...
                   everything...
                                 ANNA
                   Do the best you can with them,
                   Hector... and one more thing...
                   deliver these...
      She indicates a massive bouquet of flowers wrapped in
      cellophane, taking up the whole of the luggage space in
      the car.
                                  HECTOR
                   What?   Anna, I can't...

                                 ANNA
                   Here's the address... just two
                   blocks before the bridge... a
                   five minute detour. It's a
                   golden wedding... you have to...
      She looks him straight in the eye.

                                 ANNA
                   We have to help each other...

      Hector accepts this.

                                 ANNA
                   Oh, you'll need gas too... Go to
                   it, Hector...

      She kisses him quickly, but lovingly.

                   don't suffer alone...
      Hector watches Anna stride, in her business-like way,
      around the corner OUT OF SIGHT. He is almost home.


153   INT./EXT. CAR - DAY                                         153
      A trip from Queens to New Jersey at five o'clock on
      a Friday afternoon is going to look like a dream sequence
      whatever you do with it, and that's fine.
      Hector's trip to his children has more meaning for us
      than a simple journey from A to B. We will be aware of
      our other Hectors, and the journeys home that they did
      or didn't manage to make. This car trip will pull the
      threads together.
      And after so many images of the natural world, a world
      little altered by man, the PANORAMIC SHOTS of New York in
      all its mad glory will place our Hector in a new dimen-
      sion. If there is a breathtaking moment in this film,
      when everything comes together, when all the pieces fit,
      then it will be somewhere around here that it happens.
      Six thousand years ago we left Hector on a beach, aching
      for his family. If the traffic allows, tonight in New
      Jersey Hector will complete his journey.
      We will GO WITH Hector OVER the bridge, ACROSS the
      avenues of Manhattan and THROUGH the tunnel. His PHONE
      RINGS ONCE.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hello... Leonard, hello... yes...
                   we're insured... thank God... yes
                   now I know God's a lawyer...
                   thanks...
      On the outskirts of Jersey City he finds the suburban
      street he is looking for. If the last crosslight holds
      on green then he might even make it on time.
      Hector stops the car outside Janet's house and lets out
      a sigh of relief.

154   EXT. HOUSE - EVENING                                        154

      Hector's former wife, JANET, and her new husband, DONALD,
      come out of the house as Hector walks up to the door.
      Donald is carrying luggage and heads straight for their
      car in the driveway.

                                 DONALD
                   Hi, Hector.

      He starts loading up the car.       Janet talks to Hector.
                                 JANET
                   You made it. The kids are just
                   coming. They're not over the
                   moon about going to the beach
                   house. I ought to warn you.

                                 HECTOR
                   Why didn't you say? I could have
                   fixed up something else. I
                   thought it would be a good place
                   to get to know them again...

                                 JANET
                   Well, I figured you should be                            *
                   allowed to make your own mistakes.
                   It's only for a couple of nights,
                   they can take it... and you'll
                   learn... Check into a hotel if
                   it gets too much... they like
                   hotels.
      She shouts into the house.
                                 JANET
                   Come on, you two... your father's
                   ready to go...
      She hands Hector a piece of paper.

                                 JANET
                   This is where we'll be, if
                   anything crops up... thanks for
                   the break...
      Hector gets a little scared about what he has taken on.

                                 HECTOR
                   Maybe this is a bit sudden for
                   them... Maybe I should have come
                   over a couple of nights and got
                   to know them...

      Janet doesn't let him off the hook.
                                 JANET
                   By Monday, you'll know them...

      Then the children come out of the house, BETSY, who is
      about thirteen, and TOM, who is eleven.

                                 JANET
                   Here he is, the invisible dad.

      She turns to Hector.
                                 JANET
                   That's what they call you.

      Hector is daunted by how grown up they are, not any
      more the little kids in the photograph in his wallet.

                                HECTOR
                   Hi.
      They hardly lift their heads to him.

                                BETSY
                   Hi.
                                TOM
                   Hi.
      Janet takes control of the farewells.

                                 JANET
                   You three have a good weekend.
                   If it's too miserable at the
                   house your father said he'll
                   take you to a hotel.
      Hector nods his head obediently. He always did with
      Janet. The children let their mother pat them and follow
      Hector to his car, eyes to the ground.

                                 JANET
                   Good luck, Hector.

      Donald shouts from behind the wheel of his car, where he
      has been hiding.
                                 DONALD
                   See you Monday, Hector.
      The kids load themselves into the back of Hector's car.

      Betsy notices the huge arrangement of flowers, wrapped
      in cellophane and red ribbon. It seems to have grown
      even larger than before.
                                 BETSY
                   Are those for mom?

      Hector looks at the flowers.       His face contorts in guilt
      and anxiety.

                   No... I can't face it, not just
                   now...
      He looks at the kids.

                                   HECTOR
                   Let's go.

      They are driving on the freeway. It is dusk. Hector is
      on the telephone again. He can't let go of business.
                                 HECTOR
                   Excuse me, kids... I have to

      He gets connected.

                   phone you at home, did Boris call
                   you? The insurance is fine? Good
                   ... but she could claim negligence
                   ... oh, she's got a lawyer
                   already? That's a bad omen...
      Betsy and Tom are listening in the back seat, eager for
      clues about this virtual stranger in front of them.
                                 HECTOR
                   Is there anything we can do right
                   now... make her an offer... Sure,
                   with the insurance company... sure...
                   you're right... me, too... I have
                   the kids in the car with me right
                   now... sorry to bother you...

                                                                137.

      Hector throws the phone onto the passenger seat, lets out
      a sigh, and catches sight of the kids in the mirror.
      Their perplexed expressions make them look younger than
      they are, and vulnerable. Hector's heart aches for them.
      He smiles and puts on an act of brightness.

                                 HECTOR
                   That's it! The last call... the
                   weekend starts right now... we
                   have things to do... look out for
                   a Safeway... we need some
                   supplies... and gas... oh my God,
                   gas... soon...
      They return his look with blank expressions.        He picks up
      the phone and offers it to them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Want to make any calls?    Betsy?
      She shakes her head.
                                   HECTOR
                   Tom?
                                 TOM
                   No... and it's Thomas...
                                 HECTOR
                   But we called you Tom... that's
                   what it says on your birth
                   certificate...
                                   THOMAS (TOM)
                   I changed it.
      Hector wisely lets it go.

                                 HECTOR
                   Right... it's your name... you                            *
                   can do that... Safeway... keep your                       *

156   INT. SAFEWAY - NIGHT                                           156

      Hector is pushing a cart around a large Safeway. The
      place is almost deserted. Betsy and Thomas are tagging
      along.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

                                                               138.

      For every four items Hector puts in his cart Betsy
      removes three and returns them to the shelf. Hector
      notices and puts up with it for a while. But when Betsy
      returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he
      makes a stand. He turns to face her.

                                 HECTOR
                   What's wrong with that? It's a
                   kitchen roll... why can't I pick
                   a kitchen roll?

      Betsy is defiant.
                                 BETSY
                   It's bleached... and it isn't
                   recycled... you don't care...
                   you just buy junk...
      She picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from
      the shelf and throws it into the cart. Hector has the
      sense to back down.
                                 HECTOR
                   Good point, Betsy...
      Betsy keeps on the attack.
                                 BETSY
                   Everything you buy is junk... I
                   don't eat steak... and what's
                   this...
      She prods a packet of frozen hamburgers.

                                 BETSY
                   Ugh! Why don't you ask us what
                   we like... it'll save you money...
                   you buy junk, we won't eat it...
      A trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice.
      Hector warms to her.

                                   HECTOR
                   You're right.

      Hector pushes the cart to her.

                                 HECTOR
                   Well, get to it... I'll just tag
                   along...

      Betsy moves off with the cart.
                                 BETSY
                   I do it every week anyway.

      Thomas backs her up.

                                THOMAS
                   She does. She tells us what to
                   eat. We let her.

      Hector follows them up the aisle.

                                 HECTOR
                   Can I just keep a couple of those
                   steaks? We can't live on chicken.                   *

157   EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT                                   157

      Hector is filling up the car in a gas station close to
      the Safeway. An attractive woman is filling her car in
      the next line. Her eyes and Hector's meet. For some
      reason they exchange the smallest smile. For a few
      brief moments they are talking without words as their
      tanks fill. The ten billionth romance in the history of
      the planet sparks into life and fizzles out again in the
      twinkling of an eye. By the time their credit cards are
      back in their pockets their love is a memory. From the
      back of the car the kids have watched it all.
      Betsy gives Hector a withering look of disapproval as he
      climbs back into the car.


158   INT./EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                      158
      Back on the road, it is later. The kids have fallen
      asleep. Hector relaxes. He watches them in their sleep,
      searching for some traces of the little children that
      have haunted his thoughts for so many years, the tots
      he abandoned.

159   EXT. HOLIDAY HOUSE - NIGHT                                 159

      The car pulls up at the holiday house. Hector gets out.
      It is dark, but we can hear the sound of the SEA and
      there is sand underfoot. Hector walks to the house and
      unlocks the door. He puts on a couple of exterior lights.
      He carries Thomas, still sleeping, from the car and into
      the house. Betsy follows him, still half-asleep, groaning
      fussily. She talks through her yawns.
                                 BETSY
                   Are you going to bring the flowers
                   in?
                                 HECTOR
                   Don't mention the flowers.

                                                            140.       *

160   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         160
      Later, Hector can't sleep. It has been too eventful a
      day. He sits bleary-eyed watching a late-night TV SHOW.
      A man sits cross-legged on a studio floor and is talking
      to a phone-in viewer. The TV man has five small stones
      which he regularly scatters on the floor.

                              TV MAN (V.O.)
                This is good, Tony, the stones
                are talking to me already... now
                here's something... travel...
                movement... Tony, are you planning
                a move... travel... anything?
                              TONY (V.O.)
                Yes I am... I've been thinking
                about a move to California...

                              TV MAN (V.O.)
                The big one, eh, Tony? These
                stones are really talking here...
                what are you planning for yourself
                in California?
                              TONY (V.O.)
                I'm hoping for an acting career,
                Mel...
                              TV MAN (V.O.)
                Tony, these stones really like
                what you're planning... there is
                no doubt in my mind about that...
                now listen... you have to be
                specific... these stones really
                want to tell you something, be it
                love, money or the purpose of your
                life... but I want a specific
                question from you... think about
                it... what do you want to know...
                love... or your income level next
                year? Be as specific as you
                can, Tony...

      Perhaps this might have enthralled one of our earlier
      Hectors, but our modern one is simply restless. He
      stands up and leaves the room.


161   INT. HOUSE - NIGHT                                         161
      Next door, he watches the kids sleeping in their little
      holiday beds. Hector watches them. We've seen our
      Hectors do this before, and we feel the echo. But as
      he turns to leave the room Hector gets a fright.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                               141.         *

      Betsy starts talking loudly. At first Hector thinks she
      is awake, giving him into trouble, but she is fast asleep.

                                 BETSY
                   Get me the books... all the books...
                   all of the books... no, no, no...
                   not the pancakes... not the
                   pancakes... no...
      She changes in an instant from a bossy adolescent to a
      tearful, crumpled little girl. She sobs pitifully.

                                 BETSY
                   ... not the pancakes...

      Hector is a confusion of feelings: frightened,
      fascinated, impotent. How can he help her? How could he
      possibly unravel the secret of the pancakes, what comfort
      could he offer his stranger daughter if he did? It is
      a spooky, mystical moment for Hector, more mystical than
      the mumbo-jumbo still issuing from the TV next door.
                                 TV WOMAN (V.O.)
                   ... find your true cosmic partner
                   first time around... every weekday
                   morning at three here on the Psychic
                   Network... Lucinda's Horoscope Dating
                   Show... remember there is an answer,
                   and there is a special partner out
                   there for you...
      Hector moves quietly out of the room, Betsy's sobs having
      subsided. Just as he is closing the door he gets
      another surprise, this time from the sleeping Thomas.
                                 THOMAS
                   ... don't let the oil run out...
                   yes you did... watch the oil...
                   why... why?
      Hector closes the bedroom door.     He is one spooked, moved
      human being.

162   INT. HOUSE - MORNING                                          162

      In the morning, they are making breakfast in the kitchen.
      The kids are having juice and cereal. Hector is
      scrambling some eggs.

                                 HECTOR
                   How about some eggs?
      They shake their heads.

                                 HECTOR
                   You don't eat eggs?

                                 BETSY
                   How many have you got in there?

                                  HECTOR
                   Three.   Is that all right?
                                 BETSY
                   For a week, maybe.

      Hector does a little probing.
                                 HECTOR
                   How about pancakes, Betsy... d'you
                   like pancakes?
                                 BETSY
                   Not much... why?
                                 HECTOR
                   I just wondered. Pancakes don't
                   mean much to you?
                                 BETSY
                   They don't mean a thing.     Why?
                                 HECTOR
                   Nothing.
      The mystery of Betsy's pancake dream is evidently lost in
      infinity. Hector changes the subject.

                                 HECTOR
                   I thought we could walk into town
                   this morning. I saw the Funfair
                   when we came through last night.
                                 THOMAS
                   We don't go to Funfairs.

                                 HECTOR
                   Let's take the walk anyway.

                                 THOMAS
                   I brought some books.   I want to
                   stay home and read.
      Hector is determined to make it work.

                                  HECTOR
                   No.   We're taking a walk.

                                                            143.

163   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                         163
      They are preparing to leave the house.   Thomas is still
      reluctant to go.

                              THOMAS
                It's going to rain... we should
                stay.

                              HECTOR
                Here's an umbrella... and there
                must be some old coats in here...
                and shoes... I only have these
                I'm wearing...
                              THOMAS
                Donald has some shoes...

      Thomas is already in the cupboard under the stairs.   He
      emerges with a pair of sturdy walking shoes.
                              HECTOR
                I don't know if I want to wear
                Donald's shoes.
                              THOMAS
                Why not?
      Hector declines to explain the complex   reasons that he
      might have for not wanting to wear the   shoes of his
      children's replacement father. He sits    down on the            *
      stairs to put them on. Then something    on the wall
      catches his eye.
                               HECTOR
                Wow.   Look at this.
      The kids' heights have been marked on the wall on some
      long-ago holiday. The dates are beside them.

                              HECTOR
                Six years ago. Look at that...
                What's this?

      He points to a mark and a date lower down on the wall.
                              THOMAS
                That was the flood. The sea came
                right up. Donald says it's the
                icecap melting. It's going to get
                worse. That's why Mom's selling
                the place.

                   It comes up every year?

                                   BETSY

164   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                               164
      They are on the beach, walking in the direction of town.
      Hector strides ahead in a show of enthusiasm, although
      awkward in Donald's big shoes. The kids trail behind.
      He calls back to them.
                                 HECTOR
                   Where are the birds?    Is it the
                   wrong time of year?
                                 BETSY
                   They don't come over so much.
                   The shellfish have gone... that's
                   what...
                                 HECTOR
                   That's what Donald says?
                                 BETSY
                   Yes... and it happens to be true.

      Hector looks at the sky.       He speaks quietly to himself.
                                 HECTOR
                   Please don't rain... please...


165   EXT. FUNFAIR - DAY                                             165

      The light DRIZZLE now falling is keeping away what few                *
      fun-seekers there are left in town. The Funfair is not
      much fun. It is the end of the season. Hector and the                 *
      kids are a sorry sight parading the empty alleys. The
      kids seem to glory in the misery of it all, getting back
      at Hector for four years of neglect. Heavy-hearted,
      Hector still tries to make a go of it.

                                 HECTOR
                   Let's have a ride...
      He has stopped at some dated space rockets.

                                 BETSY
                   The seats are wet.
      Hector triumphs. He pulls a wad of kitchen roll from
      his pocket and starts to wipe the seats.
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                              145.

                                 HECTOR
                   Kitchen roll, unbleached,
                   re-cycled, biodegradable... dry
                   seats...
      Betsy has the grace to smile as the three of them climb
      aboard the rockets.

      As the attendant releases the brakes and cranks them up
      into the drizzle, 'round and 'round, Hector knows that he
      has to do something to break the awful distance between
      him and his kids. He looks at them. They sit grimly in
      their rockets, one in front of him and one behind. Their
      faces are set in expressions of what? Boredom?
      Resignation? Patience? Expectancy? Then he realizes
      what is going on. They are waiting for him to open up to
      them, talk to them seriously, explain himself. He looks
      at Betsy's face and sees in it the years of his absence,
      her stoicism, her patience, her courage. It moves him.
      He leans over to her.
                                 HECTOR
                   This is ridiculous. Let's go
                   somewhere and talk.
      Betsy smiles her small patient smile.
                                 BETSY
                   All right, if you want to...
      Hector looks to Thomas. Thomas vigorously nods his
      agreement. Hector is happier. He looks down on the
      decrepit fairground.

                                 HECTOR
                   How do we land these things?


166   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY                                       166
      The only place the small town has to offer is a deserted
      coffee shop on the shorefront. Hector, Betsy and Thomas
      sit at a corner table, beyond them through the window is
      the beach and the ocean.

                                 HECTOR
                   Sure you won't have a pancake,                          *
                   Betsy?                                                  *
      Betsy gets impatient.                                                *

                                BETSY                                      *
                   No!                                                     *

                   Okay, first question?                                     *

      The kids are ready for this.        There is no coyness now.
                                 THOMAS
                   Where have you been?

                                 BETSY
                   What he means is why did you stay
                   away?

      Hector begins like a story-teller embarking on a long
      saga.

                                 HECTOR
                   Well, that's a fair question...
                   your mother and I got divorced...
                   you're big enough to remember...
                   she must have told you all that?
                                 BETSY
                   Sure she has... but lots of people
                   get divorced... that doesn't mean
                   they disappear...
                                 HECTOR
                   You're right... what can I tell
                   you... I went kind of crazy after
                   that, for a good while... I came
                   around a few times... remember?
                                 THOMAS
                   Not really.
                                 HECTOR
                   Well, it wasn't easy... everything
                   with her and Donald happened
                   pretty quickly. I missed you both
                   really badly... but for a while I
                   thought I should stay away, until
                   your mother got settled... no,
                   that's not really true... I missed
                   you... but I was kind of crazy at
                   the same time... your mother and I
                   married young... I wasn't used to
                   the freedom... it went to my head
                   ... then you moved to New Jersey.

                   bus...
                                 HECTOR
                   You're right, you're right. I
                   don't have too many excuses for
                   the first year... the second year
                   is easier... I was in jail.
      Hector is pleased with this.       A solid excuse.

                                THOMAS
                   What for?

                                 HECTOR
                   We were doing government work,
                   big contracts... there were some
                   temptations... my boss asked me
                   to shuffle a few papers... there
                   was a lot of money in it... I had
                   to testify against him... it was
                   like killing somebody.

      Hector thinks about this, remembering the pain. For us
      there is the echo of the real killing that was done long
      ago.
                                 BETSY
                   Thomas wanted to visit you in
                   jail, but Mom wouldn't let him.                        *
      Hector looks at Thomas.

                                HECTOR
                   You did?

      Thomas nods proudly.
                                 HECTOR
                   Well I appreciate that... but I'm
                   glad your mother didn't let you.
                   I'll tell you all about it some
                   day.  It was no fun. One year
                   and eight months.

                                 THOMAS
                   We didn't even know when you got
                   out.

                   Yes. We rent apartments... but
                   we want to get into commercial
                   property... people are a
                   nuisance... does that sound bad?
      Betsy shrugs her shoulders.

      Hector carries on with his story.

                   Just recently I've been feeling

      They have almost exhausted themselves in this first bout

167   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                              167
      Betsy and Hector are sitting on the sea wall, watching
      Thomas play on the beach. The sun is emerging.

                                 BETSY
                   I have to ask you something else.

                                HECTOR
                   Go on.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                                              150.

                                 BETSY
                   Why did you leave just two days
                   before my swimming test?
      Hector is moved by the depth of her memory, her pain.

                                 HECTOR
                   I didn't leave because it was two
                   days before your test... it was
                   just what your mother and I
                   decided... I taught you how to
                   swim... we went to the pool twice
                   a week... why would I leave?
                                 BETSY
                   I know... that's what I mean...
                   why did you leave just then?
      Hector looks at Betsy. She is beginning to cry silently.
      He puts a tentative arm around her shoulder.
                                 HECTOR
                   Oh, God, Betsy. I'm sorry.

      Betsy is still crying.
                                 BETSY
                   It doesn't matter.

                                 HECTOR
                   How did you do, in the test?
                                BETSY
                   I passed.
      Hector leaves his limp arm on her shoulder. It is too                *
      soon for gestures of emotion. After a long moment she
      speaks.
                                 BETSY
                   I'm a life-saver now.

      Hector doesn't make the obvious comment. His emotions
      are full. He hides his feelings in a gruff call to
      Thomas.

                                 HECTOR
                   Hey, Thomas! We're going home...
                   we're having a barbecue... Betsy
                   said she'll even let me eat a
                   steak!

                                 BETSY                                     *
                   Hurry up, Tom!                                          *

                                                          151.       *

      Thomas breaks off from his play and runs towards them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Don't call him Tom, he doesn't
                   like it.

                                  BETSY
                   I'm allowed.
      Somehow Hector is touched by this.

                                 HECTOR
                   Your mother said it, when we
                   split up... don't lose the
                   children... didn't mean much at
                   the time. But she was right.

                                 BETSY
                   Who said I'd let you eat a steak?
      There is a silence.      Then Hector speaks.
                                   HECTOR
                   Betsy.    On Monday will you come
                   with me   when I take the flowers
                   back to   Anna? I can't face her
                   alone.    She wants to meet you
                   anyway.

                                  BETSY
                   Sure.
                                 HECTOR
                   You'll be there, right beside me?
                                 BETSY
                   I'd have to take the morning off
                   school.
                                  HECTOR
                   Is that bad?

                                 BETSY
                   No, that could be good...

      Betsy and Hector are quite close now.

                                 HECTOR
                   Just tell them you were with your
                   invisible dad.

                                                             152.        *

168   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                             168
      Hector and Betsy are walking on the shore.     Thomas tags
      along behind them.

                              BETSY
                What's she like? How did you
                meet her?

                              HECTOR
                The funny thing is I fell in love
                with her before I ever saw her...
                I smelled her... It was the day I
                got out of jail... I was on the
                train and she was sitting behind
                me... it was just this incredible
                perfume... remember I'd been
                inside for nearly two years with
                four hundred sweating males...
                She got off the train and I
                followed her... I couldn't help
                it... that's how good she is...
                she listened to a bum who followed
                her off a train...
      Betsy looks at him kindly.
                              HECTOR
                ... but she's still going to kill
                me on Monday...

      They share a laugh.   Betsy looks out to the ocean.
                              BETSY
                I think I'll paint the sunset
                tonight.
                              HECTOR
                It's just like a big pancake
                up there, isn't it?
      Betsy doesn't take the bait.   There is a silence.

                              HECTOR
                I remember when you two were tiny..
                I used to watch you sleeping... it
                was like now... I felt close to you,
                could touch you... but you weren't
                there... you were gone... dreamland
                ... just when I was closest to you,
                you weren't there... I felt it last
                night, too.

                              BETSY
                That's what it's like... you
                should know that.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'm not smart about things like
                   that, usually.
                                 BETSY
                   Don't be so tough on yourself.
                   You seem to want to be... you
                   don't have to...
                                  HECTOR
                   No?

                                 BETSY
                   No... we can do that...

      She smiles. Hector is out of his depth with this
      daughter of his.
                                 HECTOR
                   Is that a joke?
                                 BETSY
                   No, I mean it... look out for
                   yourself...
      Hector looks at her in wonderment. One of those moments
      when another human being stands before you and is an
      utter mystery.

                                  HECTOR
                   Who are you?   Who's inside
                   there?
                                 BETSY
                   You'll never know.
      Future generations of women are going to be just as
      unknowable to our Hectors as past ones were. Betsy
      moves off briskly along the beach. Hector trails
      after her, hooked.


169   EXT. BOAT - DAY                                              169
      Betsy and Thomas are in a small fragile rowboat, some
      distance from the shore. They are watching Hector who
      is collecting a pile of large stones on the beach.
      Another Hector and another pile of stones. This one
      is making a fire for the barbecue. These human rituals
      never stop.

                                 BETSY
                   I thought he was taller.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                   Well, it's been a while... you're
                   bigger.
                                 BETSY
                   I suppose so. He's getting fat,
                   too. I bet I could beat him at
                   the breast-stroke now.

170   EXT. BEACH - DAY                                              170

      Hector turns from his work. Out at sea the kids look
      small and vulnerable. Hector is more anxious than he
      should be, out of practice at fatherhood. He calls to
      them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Come on in, kids... that boat
                   doesn't look too safe...
      They call back to him.
                                 BETSY
                   We're fine!
      Hector tries to relax, but he doesn't have the
      confidence yet, or something. He is edgy.

                                 HECTOR
                   I've just found you... I don't
                   want to lose you. What would I
                   tell your mother... come on in...

      He walks down to the water. The kids reluctantly pull
      on the oars and bring the little boat in. A few feet
      from the beach they hit some sand. The boat sticks.
      Hector wades out in his shoes so far. Then he calls
      to Thomas.
                                 HECTOR
                   Throw me the rope, Thomas, I'll
                   pull you in.
      Thomas throws the mooring rope to Hector. It isn't
      attached to the boat. Hector ends up with all of the
      rope in his hands. He stands there, and they all laugh.
                                 HECTOR
                   This is one useless piece of
                   rope, Thomas...

      Just for a moment we have the image of our     Hector
      standing on the shoreline with a length of     rope. An
      image with an echo from six thousand years     ago. But
      this time Hector is laughing, and his kids     are safe.

                                                            155.         *

171   EXT. BEACH - SUNSET                                          171
      At the very moment of sunset Betsy is trying to capture
      it in a watercolor sketch. She has set up an easel on
      the beach. It's like action painting. She works
      frantically on the picture, racing the sun as it dips
      into the ocean. Tough little Betsy can even lose
      patience with the sun.

                              BETSY
                Why does it always go so fast...?
      Thomas is laughing at her. He has seen    her attempt this
      before. Hector has other concerns. He     is trying to
      light his barbecue. Match after match    disappears into
      his elaborate stone structure, only to   fizzle out.

      The sun finally vanishes, and Betsy goes limp at her
      easel. The sun has won the race again. She and Thomas
      watch Hector trying to light the fire. After a while
      he is conscious of their amused attention on him, then
      he becomes a little self-conscious.
                              HECTOR
                I used to know how to do this...

      They laugh a little.
                              HECTOR
                I did... I used to be really
                good at this...
      He wafts and blows ineffectually at a flicker of flame.
      There's not much of the caveman about him now.


172   EXT. BEACH - DUSK                                            172
      It is a calm dusk. Hector is turning the meat on the
      barbecue. He is in a splendid frame of mind.
                              HECTOR
                Ah... smell it... the smell of
                civilization... scorched meat...
      Hector serves the chicken onto their plates. He sits
      down beside them with his steak, and a glass of wine.
      He watches Thomas attack his chicken, and smiles.

                              HECTOR
                I'd forgotten that... how you
                eat... dedicated... like it's
                your religion!

                              THOMAS
                Things I like.

                   You used to hum to yourself too,
                   when you ate... like everything
                   was fine with the world.
      Thomas tries it out, eating and humming. It feels good
      to him. His head nods with the chewing and the tune.

                                 THOMAS
                   Hey, so I did... I'd forgotten
                   about that...

      The early stars are appearing in the sky. Hector lifts
      his eyes to a bright point low on the horizon.

                                 HECTOR
                   There she is... old Mercury...

                   No... Mercury doesn't rise 'til
                   after midnight... that's Jupiter...
      Hector is impressed by his son.

                                 HECTOR
                   I'd forgotten... we used to watch                        *
                   the stars... you could tell me the                       *
                   names of all the planets... you                          *
                   could recite them like a poem...
                   remember... at the tiny window
                   upstairs in the old house?
                                THOMAS
                   No.
                                 HECTOR
                   Oh well, not to worry. I'm glad
                   you still like astronomy though.
                                 THOMAS
                   I'm not into star-gazing so much
                   ... we're working on computer
                   modelling... we're trying to make
                   a biosphere...

                                HECTOR
                   Uh-huh?
                                 THOMAS
                   A self-sustaining life system...
                   for inter-stellar travel. But we
                   always get a methane build up, it
                   doesn't matter what we do...

                   This is at school?

                                 THOMAS
                   Yeah. We're making such a mess of
                   the world, one day we're going to
                   have to take off for somewhere
                   else...
                                 HECTOR
                   Sounds like Donald said that...

      Hector realizes how far his kids have travelled from
      him. He looks at them.

                                 HECTOR
                   Well, I'm glad you two are thinking
                   about the old planet. I'm proud
                   of you. Look how beautiful
                   everything is. Sometimes I think
                   it's people that make it all
                   wrong... we walk around with all
                   our problems...

      Betsy chimes in.
                                 BETSY
                   I don't know. If it wasn't for
                   us there'd be nobody around to
                   see it all.
      Hector stands to fetch another baked potato from the fire.
      We see the three of them in a WIDE SHOT, the evening sky
      now pulsing with more and more points of light. Hector's
      voice and laughter carry to us.
                                 HECTOR
                   Don't worry, you two... I'll tell
                   you... it's just a big, black
                   sheet up there with holes in it
                   so the light comes through...
                   that's the truth... the very
                   latest...
      Hector has come to rest, and found peace at last, however
      temporary, here on the beach, beneath the same stars that
      our first Hector wailed at six thousand years ago.
      On Monday he will face the music. The kids will go
      back home, Mrs. Philippopolis will have to be dealt with,
      and the wilting three hundred dollar bouquet of flowers.
      In general, life will take over, on Monday. But at this
      moment of calm on the beach, let's leave him while he's
      ahead.

      Their voices ring out playfully across the expanse of
      darkening beach and light-laden sky.

                                 BETSY
                   Wait a minute... I know... the

                   thing... stars and everything...
                   is sitting on the skin of a bubble
                   of milk in a bowl of cornflakes...
                   and somebody's just about to eat

      Perhaps that's just about as close as Hector and his                *
      tribe of humans will ever come to working it all out.
      But they try.                                                       *

			 BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

		   A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



	INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
	sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
	opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.


									CUT TO:


	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


				 LOTTE
		    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
		    Hatch was out of his pen. Good
		    morning.


	Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

				 CRAIG
		    Morning.

				 LOTTE
		    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
		    coming in first thing.

				 CRAIG
		    Enjoy.

				 LOTTE
		    Craig, listen, honey, I've been
		    thinking... maybe you'd feel better
		    if you got, you know, a job or
		    something.

				 CRAIG
		    We've been over this. Nobody's
		    looking for a puppeteer in today's
		    wintry economic climate.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, you know, maybe something else
		    until this whole puppet thing turns
		    around.

				 CRAIG
			    (bitterly)
		    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
		    job.

				 LOTTE
			    (sighs)
		    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
			    (beat)
		    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
		    a favor?

				 CRAIG
		    What?

				 LOTTE
		    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
		    to be a little under the weather this
		    morning.

				 CRAIG
		    Which one is Elijah again?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. Okay.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING

	The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
	A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
	The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
	version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
	wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
	above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
	His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
	a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
	puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
	would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
	the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
	puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
	brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
	device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
	collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
	its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
	around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
	off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.


				 TV ANNOUNCER
		    The crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest
		    puppeteer in the history of the 
		    world, performs "The Belle of
		    Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily
		    Dickinson puppet, directed by the
		    inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

	Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

				 CRAIG
		    Gimmicky bastard.

	Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
	female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs 
	his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

									CUT TO:

	Craig. in sport coat and tie, studies the business listings

	Another man comes and waits next to him. The doors open,
	and Craig and the other man get in.

									CUT TO:

		    No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with

				 LESTER
		    She's not my secretary. She's what
		    they call an executive liaison, and
		    I'm not banging her, if that's what
		    youre implying.

				 CRAIG
		    Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply

		    Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

				 CRAIG
		    No.

				 LESTER
		    Pity, it tells it like it is.
		    That's why the eastern, read Jewish,

		    Hello. Wendy.

				 WENDY
		    Don, I was wondering, do you know
		    why our workplace has such low
		    ceilings?

				 DON
		    It's an interesting story, Wendy.
		    Many years ago in the late 1800's,
		    James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
		    looking to invest in the future of
		    our great country, came to this town
		    and decided to erect an office
		    building.

									CUT TO:

	OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING.

				 DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)
		    He would call this building the
		    Mertin-Flemmer Building, after
		    himself and someone else, who, local
		    legend has it, was named Flemmer.

		    One day. Captain Mertin received an
		    unexpected visitor.

	There is a knock at the door.

				 MERTIN
		    Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

	A tiny woman enters.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin?

				 MERTIN
		    What want ye, girl child?

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
		    but rather an adult lady of miniature
		    proportions.

				 MERTIN
			    (taken aback)
		    I see. Well, it is not my fault that
		    thou art tiny. So if it is charity
		    yer after, then be gone with ye,
		    ye foul demon.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not asking for alms, but rather
		    the ear of a kind man with a noble
		    heart.

				 MERTIN
			    (sighs)
		    Aye. Speak then if ye must.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin, surely I am a
		    God-fearing Christian woman like
		    yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
		    are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
		    lady, Captain. after all, who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness?
		    So I am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist.
		    Why cannot there be a place for me
		    to work safe and comfortable?

	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

				 MERTIN
		    Woman, your story moves me like n
		    other. Me own sister was tiny and
		    then died. Therefore, I shall make
		    ye me wife. And I shall build a
		    floor in my building, between the
		    7th and 8th, which will be scaled
		    down, so from now on there shall
		    be at least one place on God's green
		    Earth that you and your accursed
		    kind can live in peace...

	Lotte is combing Elijah. Craig enters.

				 CRAIG
		    Hi.

				 LOTTE
		    Hi.

				 CRAIG
			    (nervous, talking too much)
		    Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just
		    wouldn't let me go. Were supposed
		    to have dinner with him on Friday.
		    I can get us out of it if you want.
		    He's really amazing, this insane old
		    lech. It's actually sort of amusing
		    when you get past just how disgusting
		    it is.

	There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah.
	Finally:

				 LOTTE
		    Did you eat?

				 CRAIG
		    Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I
		    didn't call. It was just, you know,
		    hard to get away.

				 LOTTE
		    I was worried.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. How was your evening?

				 LOTTE
		    Tom-Tom's puncture wound is
		    infected.

				 CRAIG
		    The ferret?

				 LOTTE
		    The iguana.

				 CRAIG
		    Right.

				 LOTTE
		    I dressed the wound. Then I've
		    just been feeding everyone, putting
		    everyone to bed.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. You want a beer?

				 LOTTE
		    No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

				 CRAIG
		    All right. I'll be in my workshop
		    for a little while. I'll be in in
		    a little while. I need to unwind a
		    little.
			    (beat)
		    I'll be in soon. A little while.

				 LOTTE
		    'kay.

	Lotte exits.

	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

	Craig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets
	sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a
	pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice.

				 CRAIG
			    (as Maxine, fascinated)
		    Tell me, Craig, why do you love
		    puppeteering?
			    (as Craig)
		    Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
		    Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
		    someone else for a little while.
		    Being inside another skin. Moving
		    differently, thinking differently,
		    feeling differently.
			    (as Maxine)
		    Interesting. Would you like to be
		    inside my skin, Craig? Think what I
		    think? Feel what I feel?
			    (as Craig)
		    More than anything. Maxine.
			    (as Maxine)
		    It's good in here, Craig. Better
		    than your wildest dreams.

	The puppets kiss.

		    Hi.

				 MAXINE
		    You're not someone I could get
		    interested in. Craig. You play
		    with dolls.

				 CRAIG
			    (rehearsed)
		    Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea
		    of being inside someone else,
		    feeling what they feel, seeing
		    what they see...

				 MAXINE
		    Yikes.

				 CRAIG
		    Please, let me explain.

	Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty
	office.

	Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door.

				 CRAIG
		    It's just, and I've never done
		    this before, Maxine, but it's just
		    that I feel something for you. I've
		    never felt this before for anyone,
		    not even my wife. My future is with
		    you, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    You might want to check those tarot
		    cards one more time.

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts
	his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he
	notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across
	it.

				 CRAIG
		    Another evil secret of the 7 1/2
		    floor.

	Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a
	dark and wet membranous tunnel inside.

				 CRAIG
		    Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love
		    this.

	Craig lets go of the door and it slams shut.

		    never, never use it while bathing in

				 CRAIG
		    Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was

				 LESTER
		    Ah. yes, the little door.

				 WENDY
		    Well, Don, I peeked in here, even

		    Isn't it cute? It's almost like a

		    Don't you want to know what happened

		    No.

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    This is important!

				 MAXINE
			    (looking at his hand on her arm)
		    It better be.

	Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    There's a tiny door in that empty
		    office. It's a portal, Maxine. It
		    takes you inside John Malkovich.
		    You see the world through John
		    Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
		    fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
		    a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
		    Turnpike.

				 MAXINE
		    Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
		    John Malkovich?

				 CRAIG
		    He's an actor. One of the great
		    American actors of the 20th century.

				 MAXINE
		    What's he been in?

				 CRAIG
		    Lots of things. He's very well
		    respected. That jewel thief movie,
		    for example. The point is that this
		    is a very odd thing, supernatural,
		    for lack of a better word. It raises
		    all sorts of philosophical questions
		    about the nature of self, about the
		    existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
		    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
		    right, is duality an illusion? Do
		    you see what a can of worms this
		    portal is? I don't think I can go
		    on living my life as I have lived
		    it. There's only one thing to do.
		    Let's get married right away.

				 MAXINE
		    Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

				 CRAIG
		    Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

				 MAXINE
		    Good. We'll sell tickets.

				 CRAIG
		    Tickets to Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

				 CRAIG
		    But there's something profound here,
		    Maxine, we can't exploit it.

				 MAXINE
		    Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
		    to offer a partnership to you, but
		    this way it's more money for me.

				 CRAIG
		    You wanted to be partners with me?

				 MAXINE
			    (bored)
		    Sure. It'd be fun.

				 CRAIG
			    (pleased)
		    Really?
			    (then:)
		    But, Maxine, can of worms! End of
		    the world! Illusory nature of
		    existence!

				 MAXINE
		    I'll protect you, Dollface.

	Maxine reaches over and squeezes his lips affectionately
	between her thumb and forefinger.

		    you and, well, speaking to you
		    now has gotten me sort of excited
		    and...

				 LOTTE (0.S.)
			    (turned on)
		    Oh, I like this.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Listen, this is not amusing. Please
		    don't call here any...

				 MAXINE (0.S.) (giggling)
		    Ooh, such authority! NY nipples are
		    at attention, General Malkovich, sir.
		    So I'll be at Bernardo's tonight at
		    eight. Please, please meet me there.
		    I just adored you in that jewel thief
		    movie...

	Malkovich hangs up the phone.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    My God!
			    (attempting thought control) 
		    Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
		    her there. Meet her there. Meet her
		    there...

	Malkovich goes back to his script.

				 LOTTE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		    Meet her there. Meet her there. Meet
		    her there...

	Malkovich picks up a pen and writes: Bernardo's 8:00.

	EXT. DITCH - MORNING

	Craig waits. Lotte pops into the ditch. She's wet and slimy.

				 CRAIG
		    How was it?

				 LOTTE
		    I have to go back tonight. At eight
		    Exactly.

				 CRAIG
		    Why?

				 LOTTE
		    Don't crowd me, Craig.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BERNARDO'S - NIGHT

	Malkovich's POV. It's a busy Italian restaurant. Malkovich
	looks around, checks his watch: 8:03. A guy walks up to him.

				 GUY
		    Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes.

				 GUY
		    Wow. You were really great in that
		    movie where you played that retard.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Thank you very much.

				 GUY
		    I just wanted to tell you that. And
		    say thank you. I have a cousin that's
		    a retard, so, as you can imagine, it
		    means a lot to me to see retards
		    portrayed on the silver screen so
		    compassionately.

	The guy walks away. Malkovich scans the room. Maxine enters
	the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her
	out of the crowd. She looks around.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    Maxine!

	Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.

				 MAXINE
		    Hi. I'm so glad you decided to
		    come. I'm Maxine.

	Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes
	her hand.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm John. I didn't think I was going
		    to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
		    I have to admit I was a bit intrigued
		    by your voice.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    God, she's beautiful. The way she's
		    looking at me. At him. At us.

				 MAXINE
		    And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,
		    my voice is probably the least
		    intriguing thing about me.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    I've never been looked at like this
		    by a woman.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Can I get you a drink?

				 MAXINE
		    Whatever you're having.

									CUT TO:

				INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S CAR - NIGHT

	Craig drives. Lotte is soaking wet. She stares out the
	window.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it? What was he doing?

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
		    around his apartment. I think he must
		    be a lonely man.

				 CRAIG
		    You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
		    too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
		    You shouldn't be so quick to assume
		    that switching bodies would be the
		    answer to all your problems.

				 LOTTE
		    You're right. You know I was thinking
		    that we should have Maxine over for
		    dinner. Since you two are partners
		    and all. It might be a nice gesture.

				 CRAIG
		    I don't know. There's some tension
		    between us. I'd hate to expose you to
		    that.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.
		    Well smoke a joint.
			    (dreamily)
		    Tensions will melt away.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

	Craig, Lotte, and Maxine are seated at the table and eating
	lasagna. Lotte eyes Maxine. Craig eyes Maxine. There is an
	awkward silence.

				 LOTTE
			    (to Maxine)
		    Did you know that Eskimos have not
		    one, but fifty words for snow. It's
		    because they have so much of it.

				 CRAIG
		    After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

				 MAXINE
		    Ah.

				 LOTTE
		    After that I'll introduce you to my
		    favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an
		    ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood
		    trauma. But we're getting to the
		    bottom of it.
			    (whispers)
		    Psychotherapy.

	There is another silence.

				 MAXINE
			    (to no one in particular) 
		    The way I see it, the world is divide
		    into those go after what they want
		    and those who don't. The passionate
		    ones, the ones who go after what they
		    want, may not get what they want, but
		    they remain vital, in touch with
		    themselves, and when they lie on
		    their deathbeds, they have few
		    regrets. The ones who don't go
		    after what they want... well, who
		    gives a shit about them anyway?

	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

				 CRAIG
		    You?

	Lotte looks away.

				 MAXINE
		    Craig, I just don't find you
		    attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
		    with you, but only when you're in
		    Malkovich. When I looked into his
		    eyes last night, I could feel you
		    peering out. Behind the stubble and
		    the too-prominent brow and the male
		    pattern baldness, I sensed your
		    feminine longing peering out, and
		    it just slew me.

				 CRAIG
			    (disgusted)
		    My God.

	Lotte strokes Maxine's face. Craig clears dishes from the
	table.

				 MAXINE
			    (to Lotte, removing her hand)
		    Only to John, sweetie. I'm sorry. 
			    (gets up)
		    Thanks for a wonderful dinner.
			    (walks past kitchen. to Craig)

	It is deadly silent. Craig and Maxine sit at their desks.
	The wall clock ticks. Craig whistles tunelessly, every

	Maxine. Eventually there is a knock at the door.

				 CRAIG
			    (a little too urgently)
		    Come in!

	Erroll, a sad, fat young man enters meekly.

				 ERROLL
		    Hello, I'm here about the ad.

				 CRAIG
		    Please, have a seat.

	Erroll sits in a chair in front of Craig's desk. He
	glances nervously over at Maxine.

				 ERROLL
		    When you say, I can be somebody
		    else, what do you mean exactly?

				 CRAIG
		    Exactly that. We can put you inside 
		    someone else's body for fifteen minutes.

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, this is just the medical
		    breakthrough I've been waiting for.
		    Are their any side effects? Please
		    say no! Please say no!

				 MAXINE
		    No.

				 ERROLL
		    Long term psychic or physiological
		    repercussions?

				 MAXINE
		    No. Don't be an ass.

				 ERROLL
		    Can I be anyone I want?

				 MAXINE
		    You can be John Malkovich.

				 ERROLL
		    Well that's perfect. My second
		    choice. Ah, this is wonderful.
		    Too good to be true! You see, I'm
		    a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh,
		    I've tried all the diets, my friends.
		    Lived for a year on nothing but

	enormous bear hug.

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, thank you! Thank you! 
		    Thousand times, thank you!

				 CRAIG
			    (gasping for air)
		    Tell your friends.

				 ERROLL
		    Oh, I will, and I have many,

				 CRAIG
		    This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!

				 MAXINE
		    So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.

	Craig unlocks the door. Lester steps in, closes the door
	behind him, locks it.

				 LESTER
		    You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.
			    (nods to Maxine)
		    Ma'am

				 CRAIG
		    Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're
		    talking about.

				 LESTER
		    There are rules, boy, procedures,
		    etiquette. This is not a toy. I've
		    been waiting seventy years to utilize
		    this room, grooming myself, quietly
		    setting the stage, performing
		    ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all
		    his motion pictures again and again.
		    Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping

				 CRAIG
		    You're insane.

				 LESTER
		    I am not alone. There are others. We

				 LOTTE
		    I'm getting rid of the animals. I've

		    Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen
		    the passionate side of sweet Maxine
		    before, or her actual tits for that
		    matter. If only, I've been thinking
		    to myself, if only I could actually
		    feel what Malkovich feels, rather
		    than just see what he sees... And
		    then, dare I say it, if only I could
		    control his arms, his legs, his
		    pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll never happen, fuckface.

				 CRAIG
		    Ah, but you're forgetting one thing,
		    Lambchop.

				 LOTTE
		    What's that?

				 CRAIG
		    I'm a puppeteer.

	Craig picks up the phone and dials. He smiles as he
	holds the receiver up to Lotte's face.

	INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Malkovich and Maxine are having sex on Maxine's couch.

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte, this is so good...

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
			    (tense, commanding)
		    Move right hand across her left breast
		    now. Move right hand across her left
		    breast now. Move right hand across her
		    left breast now.

	Malkovich clumsily, awkwardly moves his hand across Maxine's
	breast.

				 CRAIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		    Holy shit, yes!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Holy shit, yes!

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
		    Holy shit! He said what I said!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Holy shit! He said what I said!

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte? Is that you?

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
		    Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
			    (scared)
		    What the fuck is going on? I'm not

		    Oh, Lotte...

	Maxine kisses Malkovich hard on the lips. There is a

	A panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Something was making me talk. Some
		    Goddamn thing was making me move. I
		    gotta get out of here.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
		    for me taking hold.

				 MALKOVICH
		    No, Dollface, I know what my passion
		    taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

	He leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs
	contentedly.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	A wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound
	and gagged.

				 CRAIG
		    I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
		    across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
		    I made him talk. And, oh, there was
		    the beginning of sensation in the
		    fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
		    matter of practice before Malkovich
		    becomes nothing more than another
		    puppet hanging next to my worktable.
		    Coffee?

									CUT TO:

	Malkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand.
	Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's like nothing I've ever felt

				 KEVIN BACON
		    I'm sure you're not going crazy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Kevin, I'm telling you... it was
		    like nothing I've...

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
		    Were you stoned?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes, but you see, someone else was
		    talking through my mouth.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You were stoned. Case closed. End
		    of story. How hot is this babe?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I think it might've been this Lotte
		    woman talking through me. Maxine
		    likes to call me Lotte.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
		    to channel some dead lesbian lover.
		    Let me know when you're done with her.
		    This is my type of chick.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm done with her now. Tonight really
		    creeped me out.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You're crazy to let go of a chick who
		    calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
		    friend.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I don't know anything about her. What
		    if she's some sort of witch or
		    something?

				 KEVIN BACON
		    All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian
		    Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy.
		    Ha ha ha.

		    The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against

	distance.

									CUT TO:

	INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING

	The elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and
	a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is
	Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor.
	He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat
	people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door.
	Maxine sees "J.M. Inc." stenciled on the office door. He
	turns to the first fat man and line.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Excuse me, what type of service does
		    this company provide?

				 FAT MAN
		    You get to be John Malkovich for
		    fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (quietly flipped)
		    I see.

				 FAT MAN
		    No cutting, by the way.

	Malkovich pounds on the door.

				 FAT MAN (CONT'D)
		    No cutting!

	Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating
	him. Craig steps out of the office.

				 CRAIG
		    Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
		    Everybody gets a chance to be...

	The fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap
	have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.

				 FAT MAN
		    It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.
		    Malkovich! I hope me and my
		    associates from Overeaters Anonymous

		    What the fuck is going on?

				 CRAIG
		    Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig
		    Schwartz. I can explain. We operate
		    a little business her that...
		    simulates, for our clientele, the
		    experience of... being you, actually.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Simulates?

				 CRAIG
		    Sure, after a fashion.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try.

				 CRAIG
		    You? Why I'm sure it would pale in
		    comparison to the actual experience.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try!

				 MAXINE
		    Let him try.

				 CRAIG
		    Of course, right this way, Mr.
		    Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

	Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (repulsed by the slime)
		    Jesus.

	Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.

				 CRAIG
		    What happens when a man climbs
		    through his own portal?

									CUT TO:

	PSYCHEDELIC MONTAGE

	We see Malkovich hurtling through different environments.
	It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored
	lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet
	clown paintings.

									CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's
	wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is
	also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the
	restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes.
	Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the
	table looks at him seductively, winks and talks.

				 GIRL MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
		    Malkovich...

	Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches,
	pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders.

	Malkovich looks down at the menu. Every item is "Malkovich."
	He screams:

				 MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich!

	The waiter jots it down on his pad.

				 WAITER MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich.

	Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for
	the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich
	is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a
	'40's style big band of Malkoviches.

	Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting
	there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World
	in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is
	huddled and shivering and soaking wet.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it?

				 MALKOVICH
		    That... was... no... simulation.

				 CRAIG
		    I know. I'm sorry...

				 MALKOVICH
		    I have been to the dark side. I have
		    seen a world that no man should ever
		    see.

				 CRAIG
		    Really? For most people it's a rather
		    pleasant experience. What exactly did
		    you...

				 MALKOVICH
		    This portal is mine and must be sealed
		    up forever. For the love of God.

				 CRAIG
		    With all respect, sir, I discovered
		    that portal. Its my livelihood.

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
		    you in court!

	Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.

				 CRAIG
			    (calling after him)
		    And who's to say I won't be seeing
		    what you're seeing... in court?

	Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.

				 MOTORIST
		    Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!

	Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car
	and hits him on the head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants.
	He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She
	looks haggard.

				 LOTTE
		    Once this was a relationship based
		    on love. Now you have me in a cage
		    with a monkey and a gun to my head.

				 CRAIG
		    Things change. Anyway, you gave up your
		    claim to that love the first time you
		    stuck your dick in Maxine.

				 LOTTE
		    You fell in love with her first.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah but I didn't do anything about
		    it. Out of respect for our marriage.

				 LOTTE
		    You didn't do anything about it out
		    of respect for the fact that she
		    wouldn't let you near her with a ten
		    foot pole, which is, by the way,
		    about nine feet, nine inches off
		    the mark anyway.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what
		    have I become? My wife in a cage
		    with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
		    Betrayal in my heart.

				 LOTTE
		    Maybe this is what you've always
		    been, Craig, you just never faced
		    it before.

				 CRAIG
		    Perhaps you're right. I can't let
		    you go though. Too much has happened.
		    You're my ace in the hole.

				 LOTTE
		    I need a shower.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm
		    some kind of monster. I'm the guy
		    you read about in the paper and go,
		    "he's some kind of monster."

				 LOTTE
		    You're not a monster, Craig. Just
		    a confused man.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you so much.

	She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

				 LOTTE
		    We have to meet.

				 MAXINE
		    One hour.

	Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.

				 CRAIG
		    I'll tell you all about it when I
		    get home.

	Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands
	Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly
	watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow.
	Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into
	his eyes.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

	It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed
	out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa."
	The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
	watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
	suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
	chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
	them up. The safari men laugh.

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Well, there monkeys ain't going
		    nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
		    brews 'fore the boss comes back...

	The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
	from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
	of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.

				 CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Son, untie your mother and me!
		    Quickly! Before the great bald
		    chimp-men return.

	A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
	struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
	speaks.

				 CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Hurry, Elijah!

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Why you little bastard!

	Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the
	ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He
	works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her
	mouth.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!

	Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks
	the cage, and dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me
		    in John the last three times. Craig's
		    had me locked up in the apartment. He
		    made me call you at gunpoint. It's
		    been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
			    (beat, calmly)
		    Really? Well, you know, he's quite
		    good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
		    a session with Malkovich I have to
		    attend. I'll speak with you soon.

				 LOTTE
		    But Maxine, I thought it was me you
		    loved.

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    I thought so too, doll. I guess we
		    were mistaken.

	Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Hello, Dr. Lester?

									CUT TO:

	INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands
	there, dressed in an evening gown.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Come on in.

				 MAXINE
		    I can explain about the portal,
		    darling.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
		    just let you up here to tell you
		    that, and to tell you that I'm taking
		    you and Schwartz to court.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh shut up.
			    (beat)
		    Craig, darling are you in there?

	Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,
	puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be
	against him will.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes. How did you know it was me?

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte called me.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Oh, so the bitch escaped.

				 MAXINE
		    Apparently you can control this
		    Malkovich fellow now.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm getting better all the time.

				 MAXINE
		    I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
		    kitchen table, then make him eat an
		    omelette off of it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich)
		    No... damn... you...
			    (as Craig)
		    Oh shut up, you overrated sack of

	Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind
	while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig)
	laughs wildly.

	Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi

		    You know I think it pays to leave
		    juice-making to the trained
		    professionals. You look terrible,

				 LOTTE
		    Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
		    Lester.

				 LESTER
		    Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
		    inform you that I find that highly
		    arousing.

				 LOTTE
		    No, you don't understand. I've been
		    inside Malkovich when I'm with
		    Maxine...

				 LESTER
			    (slaps Lotte furiously)
		    What?! That is not allowed. My God,
		    you are supposed to be one of us.
		    You know you must never partake of
		    Malkovich by yourself!

				 LOTTE
		    No, I didn't know that.

				 LESTER
		    Oh, didn't anyone show you the

				 LOTTE
		    No.

	TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH

	A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black
	and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.

				 LESTER ON FILM
		    Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
		    As you may already know, today a
		    baby was born into this sad world.

	We see a shot of a newborn.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    His name is John Horatio Hannibal
		    Malkovich. And we are the keepers
		    of the door to his soul. One day,
		    when his brain is big enough, we
		    will all journey into his head and
		    live there for all eternity. Following
		    the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
		    we will build the ultimate communist
		    community, one body and hundreds,
		    maybe thousands, of brains inside
		    working together to form a super
		    human intellect capable of curing
		    disease, stopping all war, and
		    ruling the world with a benevolent
		    fist. We will take a wife, a woman
		    of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
		    is, as yet, still an infant herself.

	We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
	her hair.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
		    DeMent.

				 LOTTE
		    Does Floris know that she's the
		    chosen?

				 LESTER
		    Well, I tried to explain it to her,
		    but...

	Lester points to his ear and shrugs.

	Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
	relaxed.

				 MAXINE
		    You still there, sweets?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
		    on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
		    it's all in the wrists.

				 MAXINE
		    Wow.
			    (little girl pout)
		    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

				 MALKOVICH
		    You mean with Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    I'd love to see your work.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (pleased)
		    Really? Yeah. Okay.

	Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    I'll do something I call "Craig's
		    Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

	Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
	did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
	complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
	He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

				 MAXINE
			    (moved)
		    That was incredible. You're brilliant!

				 MALKOVICH
		    You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
		    with dolls.

				 MAXINE
		    You're right, my darling, it's
		    so much more. It's playing with
		    people!

	Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

				 MAXINE
		    Stay in him forever?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, screaming)
		    No!
			    (as Craig, calmly)
		    But how will we make a living,
		    my love, if our clientele doesn't
		    have access to our product?

				 MAXINE
		    Well, we'll have all the money in
		    Malkovich's bank account, plus he
		    still gets acting work occasionally.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, breaking through)
		    No! Please!
			    (as Craig, to Malkovich)
		    Shut up, will you? We're trying to
		    think here.
			    (to Maxine)
		    It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
		    I like that about it.

				 MAXINE
		    No one would ever have to know its
		    not him.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (an idea)
		    Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
		    What if we presented Malkovich as the
		    world's most complicated puppet and
		    me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
		    enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
		    with the Great Mantini!

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

									CUT TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - NIGHT

	The worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.

				 LOTTE
		    I have sinned, unwittingly, against

		    truly sorry.

				 MAN #2
		    W-w-what's it like on the inside?

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.

				 MAN #2
		    Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say
		    it's time.

				 LESTER
		    Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're
		    all prepared, and perhaps this
		    Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand
		    a bit. We will enter the portal
		    tonight!

	Everyone cheers.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal
	with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the
	office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops
	just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (Craig to Malkovich)
		    Shut up!
			    (to Maxine)
		    Sorry, dear, I lost control for
		    a minute.

				 MAXINE
			    (kissing him)
		    It's okay, my sweet.

	They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
	of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
	open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
	in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

				 LESTER
		    Aaaahhhh, the portal!

				 LOTTE
			    (to Malkovich)
		    You bastard!

	Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds
	her back.

				 LESTER
		    No! Don't harm the vessel!

				 LOTTE
		    It's Craig in there, I can tell.

				 LESTER
		    I understand, but we must protect

		    Please, Craig, please step aside
		    and allow us to have what is
		    rightfully ours.

				 CRAIG
		    Squatter's rights, Lester.

	Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
	through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
	triumphantly over at Lotte.

				 MAXINE
		    Now excuse us, we have an
		    entertainment legend to create.

				 LESTER
			    (to the cult members)
		    Clear the way for them, my friends.
		    They will be dealt with in due time.

	The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
	exit.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Now, let's see what we can do to
		    salvage this portal... for the sake
		    of all that is good.

	The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
	begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
	Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
	skin on the rough gray surface.

	INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

	A slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.

				 AGENT
		    Of course, send him right in. Don't
		    ever keep him waiting again. Do you
		    understand?

	Malkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out
	his hand.

				 AGENT (CONT'D)
		    John! Great to see you! Sorry about
		    the cunt at reception.

				 MALKOVICH
		    This is my fiancee Maxine.

	The agent shakes Maxine's hand.

				 AGENT
		    Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about
		    the cunt at reception. Please have a

	Malkovich and Maxine sit.

				 AGENT (CONT'D)
		    Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

				 MAXINE
		    No thanks.

				 AGENT
			    (into phone)
		    Teresa, get me a chicken soup.
			    (to Malkovich and Maxine)
		    Chicken soup?

	Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads "no."

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'll get right to the point, Larry.
		    I'm a puppet now...

				 AGENT
		    Okay.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm being controlled by the world's
		    greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...

				 AGENT
			    (no clue)
		    Oh yeah, he's good.

				 MALKOVICH
		    ... and I want to show off his skills
		    by performing a one-puppet
		    extravaganza in Reno.

				 MAXINE
		    Vegas.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Vegas. Can you arrange that?

				 AGENT
		    Sure, sure. Just let me make a
		    couple of calls.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY

	The cult members are still there, now with picks 
	shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is
	excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2
	emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.

				 MAN #2
		    That's the last of it, boss.

	Lester peers through the door.

				 LESTER
		    Well, let's see what we've got
		    here.

	Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind
	him.

									CUT TO:

	INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS

	Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a
	flash of light.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BUNKER - DAY

	The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.
	There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester
	views the scene through somebody's POV.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, where am I? This seems so
		    familiar.

	The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
		    Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

				 DIRECTOR
		    Cut!

	We look over to see a director and camera crew.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    Oh, I'm just the actor in that
		    Twilight Zone episode.

	There is a popping sound.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. DITCH - DAY

	Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
	waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
	shakes his head "no."

									CUT TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY

	The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.
	Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at
	the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.

				 LESTER
		    Thank you all for your efforts,
		    but I'm afraid we can no longer get
		    into Malkovich through the portal.

				 LOTTE
			    (panicky)
		    Why not? I need to get in there!

				 LESTER
		    I'm not certain, my dear, but I
		    believe your husband has somehow
		    psychically diverted the route.

				 LOTTE
		    That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
		    of him in the name of the order, Son
		    of Malkovich.

				 LESTER
		    I'm afraid that no physical harm
		    must come to him as long as he
		    inhabits the vessel.

				 MAN #3
			    (raises hand)
		    Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
		    build another portal to Malkovich,
		    like around back, and sneak in that
		    way?

				 MAN #4
		    Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
		    a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

				 LESTER
		    Actually, my friends, I suppose its
		    time I told you, I'm Captain James
		    Mertin.

	The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
	some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
	a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    You see, Lester is an anagram for
		    Mertin.

	Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
	tense now.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    It used to work, I'm sure of it.

	Several members check their watches.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

	L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
	from the board to face the congregation.

				 MAN #3
		    How can this be? I thought you were
		    only one hundred and five years old.
		    Mertin would have to be...

				 LESTER
			    (chuckles amiably)
		    I'm two hundred and five, truth be
		    told.

				 WOMAN #1
			    (flirtatiously)
		    You don't look a day over one
		    hundred and five, Captain. What's
		    your secret?

				 LESTER
		    Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
		    That, and a deal with the Devil.

	There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

				 MAN #2
		    So what exactly are you saying? Are
		    we in cahoots with the Dark Master
		    here?

				 LESTER
		    Surprise.

	The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
		    into Malkovich, we still get to rule
		    the world, just like I told you. The 
		    only difference is that we rule in the
		    name of evil, instead of good.

	People stop in their tracks.

				 MAN #3
		    That's the only difference?

				 LESTER
		    Absolutely.

	The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    So anyway...

	Lotte stands.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
		    not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
		    of you.

	Lotte heads for the door.

				 LESTER
		    My dear, let me assure you that when
		    we attain power, it will be much more
		    pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
		    than for those outside.

	Lotte stops and turns.

				 LOTTE
		    I'll take my chances.

	She exits.

				 LESTER
		    Anybody else?

				 WOMAN #1
		    Do we get to wear a crown?

				 LESTER
		    But of course.

				 WOMAN #1
		    Count me in.

				 LESTER
		    Good. I think its time to beckon
		    Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
		    out of this pickle.

									FLIP TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER

	Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and
	blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch
	him.

				 FLEMMER
		    Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
		    I didn't anticipate this.

				 LESTER
		    And as I said, sir, we can't very
		    well exert physical persuasion upon
		    the sacred vessel Malkovich.

				 FLEMMER
		    Right, Lester. I heard you the first
		    time. I'm not a dummy.

				 LESTER
		    Didn't mean to imply that you were,
		    sir.

				 FLEMMER
		    Look, I'm going back to my house
		    to ponder this. So stay calm and
		    keep track of Schwartz's comings
		    and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose
		    of Schwartz's wife, will you?
			    (to cultists)
		    Nice to meet you all.

	The cult members ad-lib "same here, sir."

	Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly
	sobbing. The caged animals watch her.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
		    not human. People are treacherous
		    and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
		    my heart to two of them and I almost
		    lost my soul to another. And I'm no
		    better. Look at the way I keep you,
		    locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
		    Well, I've been in a cage too, my
		    friends. Literally and figuratively.
		    So tonight I set you free.

	Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks
	all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their
	cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until
	she is alone.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Good-bye, friends.

	A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still
	there and holding her hand. She smiles.

		    Hello, friend

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted

	Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.
	The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.

		    They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,
		    I know too much. I should get the

	Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.
	Then he leads her by the hand out the window.

		    back the greatest puppeteer the
		    world has ever seen.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
		    me hard today.

	Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.

				 MAXINE
		    Doesn't he know how important

				 MALKOVICH

									CUT TO:

	INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT

	The house is filling with formally dressed audience members.
	The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among
	them. The lights go down.

				 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		    Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
		    great privilege of the Luxor hotel
		    and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
		    and his magical puppet John
		    Malkovich.

	The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

				 LESTER
		    Blasphemous bastard.

	Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
	nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
			    (grudgingly)
		    Pretty good though.

	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
	Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
	with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
	him.

				 USHER
		    Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
		    you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
		    there's not an empty seat in the
		    entire house.

				 MANTINI
			    (not taking his eyes from the stage)
		    Make one empty.

				 USHER
		    Y-y-y-es sir.

	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
	performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
	Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

				 LESTER
		    Not too shabby.

	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
	juggling chainsaws.

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

	At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich
	a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the
	cultists get up.

									CUT TO:

	INT. SEWER - NIGHT

	Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up
	against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of
	her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying
	supplies:  food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket
	and sits down next to her.

				 LOTTE
		    They're going to take over the
		    world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
		    But, then, evil already reigns,
		    doesn't it? So what difference
		    does it make if John Malkovich
		    is wearing the fucking crown while
		    it's reigning?

	Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is
	returning.

									CUT TO:

	INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	It's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.
	Looks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls

	head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.

				 FLEMMER
		    It's open.

	The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.

				 LESTER
		    It's just me, boss. I brought
		    croissants.

	Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.

				 FLEMMER
		    Have a seat. I wracking my brain

				 FLEMMER
			    (impressed)
		    Vegas? What'd you think?

				 LESTER
		    The kid's got talent. You've never
		    seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
		    had him up there singing and dancing.
		    Impressions.

				 FLEMMER
		    Impressions? Those are hard.

				 LESTER
		    Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
		    we can't kill him.

				 FLEMMER
		    I suppose I could come to him in a
		    dream. I don't know. That's the best
		    I can think of right now.

				 LESTER
		    A scary dream?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
		    dream.

				 LESTER
			    (noncommittally)
		    I like that.

									CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is
	surrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking
	champagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing
	table, brushing her hair.

				 MALKOVICH
		    They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz
		    is fantastic!"  The New York Times.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
		    We're going to ride this straight to

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sleepy suddenly.

				 MAXINE
		    Busy day, my little fire chief. Why

		    meet you there in just...

	But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of
	his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts 
	blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HELL - NIGHT

	Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of
	flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.
	He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away
	from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking
	the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister
	grin.

				 CRAIG
		    Who are you?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh.

				 FLEMMER
		    Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

				 CRAIG
		    Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.

									CUT TO:

		    Bad dream, darling?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I've got to leave Malkovich.

				 MAXINE
		    You've got to be kidding.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I just had the most horrifying
		    nightmare. The devil was in it.

	Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased
	with himself.

				 MAXINE
		    Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
		    can't back out because of some
		    stupid dream.

				 FLEMMER
			    (to himself)
		    Shit.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Honey, we can be happy and poor
		    together.

				 MAXINE
			    (laughs derisively)
		    Perhaps you'll want to consult that
		    Ouija board again.

	There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
		    Yeah what?!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Derek Mantini!

	Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
	Maxine give each other the once over.

				 MANTINI
			    (still eyeing Maxine)
		    Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Did you see the reviews?

				 MANTINI
		    Yeah, I saw them

				 MALKOVICH
		    Because if you missed any, I just
		    happen to have copies here you can
		    take with you when you leave now.

				 MAXINE
		    I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
		    with Malkovich.

				 MANTINI
		    Very impressive. I could use a
		    producer with your vision. And
		    other outstanding attributes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    She's not available.

				 MANTINI
		    We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MAXINE
		    Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MANTINI
		    I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
		    more importantly, mine. Here's my
		    proposal: There's only room in this
		    world for one "World's Greatest
		    Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow
		    the puppet-going public to crown
		    their king.

				 MALKOVICH
		    How do we do that?

				 MANTINI
		    A friendly competition, if you will.
		    Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
		    Truman puppet appear opposite each
		    other in a play. Not some Vegas
		    Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
		    that requires actual acting. The
		    audience decides who is more deserving
		    of the title. The losing puppeteer
		    bows out graciously. Goes back to
		    obscurity as a file clerk.

				 MALKOVICH
		    What's the play?

				 MANTINI
		    Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Never heard of it.

				 MANTINI
		    Broadway's finest three hours. It's
		    about the suppression of the
		    individual. Conformity as God in
		    modern society.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing but acting to hide behind,
		    buddy-boy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
		    with the National Puppet Company's
		    production of "Long Day's Journey
		    Into Night."

				 MANTINI
		    Great then.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Is there dancing?

				 MANTINI
		    No.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Who needs dancing?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, for God's sake, I just watered

				 FLEMMER

				 LESTER
		    The Great Mantini?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course

				 LESTER
		    Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I
		    saw him do "Tru" with his sixty
		    foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

				 FLEMMER
		    But I think I have another plan.

				 LESTER
			    (snippy)
		    Do tell. I love a good plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Why are you being like this?

	Lester shrugs.

				 LESTER
		    I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
		    the plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
		    leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
		    needs it, I help Mantini's performance
		    a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
		    show.

				 LESTER
		    Can you do that? I mean, do you know
		    anything about puppetry?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
		    handle it.

				 LESTER
		    I was just asking. No disrespect
		    intended.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. Let's drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
		    doubting you, it's just that I know
		    puppetry is a skill that takes a long
		    time to acquire.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen
		    table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a

	stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.
	Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the
	flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman
	and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Do you dream often?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Do you?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    It's my job to ask the questions.
		    Yours to answer them.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Says who?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Says me. Do you dream often?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Do you?

	We see the audience fidgeting in their seats, coughing.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The dialogue drones on as Maxine watches coolly from the
	wings. She drags on a cigarette. Mr. Flemmer, dressed as
	a stagehand, stands behind Maxine. He also watches the
	actors, with an occasional sideways glance at Maxine.

				 MAXINE
			    (without turning around)
		    Keep your eyes in your pants, old
		    timer.

	INT. THE BROADHURST LOBBY - A BIT LATER

	It's intermission. The lobby is crowded. Maxine moves
	through the crowd listening to snippets of conversation.
	Flemmer, now in a tuxedo, moves about also. First couple:

				 THEATERGOER #1
		    That Truman puppet is downright
		    boring as the psychiatrist.

				 THEATERGOER #2
		    It's a wooden performance, really.
		    Get it? Wooden?

	Second couple:

				 THEATERGOER #3
		    What's with the Malkovich puppet?
		    He was much better in Vegas when he
		    played the piano with his feet.

				 THEATERGOER #4
		    I hate it when they try to stretch.
		    It's like Woody Allen.

	Third couple:

				 THEATERGOER #5
		    They both stink! I'm going across the
		    street to second act Miss Saigon.

									CUT TO:

	INT. DRESSING ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

	Malkovich watches himself in his dressing table mirror.
	Maxine enters, flops herself down on the couch and lights
	up a cigarette.

				 MAXINE
		    You'd better turn on the pyrotechnics,
		    lover, 'cause right now you're running
		    neck and neck with the dead president.
		    And you're both in last place.

	Malkovich continues to watch himself in the mirror, nods his
	head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CATWALK ABOVE STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Mantini leans against a rail and smokes a cigarette. Charles
	Nelson Reilly, in a tuxedo, confers with him in hushed tones.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    You're doing beautifully, my boy. I
		    wept at the speech about your wife.

	Flemmer materializes behind Mantini

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    What the hell? Nyong-nyong!

	Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break
	for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in
	mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,
	too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls
	for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his
	pocket.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT

	We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace
	as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to
	be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his
	movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's
	as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    I can hear the creature's voice. It's
		    calling me out of the black cave of
		    the Psyche. I shove in my dim little
		    torch, and there he stands -- waiting
		    for me. He raises his matted head. He
		    opens his great, square teeth and says
			    (mocking)
		    'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --
		    ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really
		    imagine you can account for Me?
		    Totally, infallibly, inevitably
		    account for Me? ... Poor Dr. Dysart!'

	Malkovich watches impressed and a little scared by this
	bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and
	sees a silent, rapt crowd.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - A BIT LATER

	Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm.
	During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to
	upstage him, nodding his head, looking thoughtful, raising
	his ten foot eyebrows in surprise...

				 MALKOVICH
		    Eyes! ... White eyes -- never closed!
		    Eyes like flames -- coming -- coming!
		    ... God seest! ... God seest! ... NO!

									CUT TO:

	EXT. NEW YORK STREET - CONTINUOUS

	A man hole cover is pushed off. Lotte climbs out onto the
	street. She is dirty but determined.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL

	Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic
	convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the
	bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking
	it. Truman speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
		    Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
		    Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
		    Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
		    In. Out .. In ... Out ...

	Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the
	focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the
	crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.

				 AUDIENCE MEMBER
			    (to his wife)
		    That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
		    actor.

				 FLEMMER
			    (blood boiling)
		    Bastard is stealing my thunder.

	Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,
	swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he
	talks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
		    delivered from madness. What then?
		    He'll feel himself acceptable! What
		    then?

	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
		    erase the welts cut into his body by
		    flying manes.

	The audience "ooohs" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his
	clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from "Swan
	Lake." The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,
	now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and
	flying around the auditorium as he speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
		    will be quite safe. You'll save your
		    pennies every week, till you can
		    change that scooter into a car...

	The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,
	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr.
	Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.
	Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just
	raised from the dead.

				 ACTUAL TRUMAN
		    Where am I? Aren't I dead?
			    (possessed)
		    Vote for Mantini!

	Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant
	puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a
	standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the
	catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Malkovich walks past Maxine. She doesn't even look at him.
	Thunderous applause is heard in the background.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Good-bye, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    Whatever.

	Malkovich drops limply to the floor. He lifts his head.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (weak but relieved)
		    I'm back! My nightmare is over.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CATWALK - CONTINUOUS

	Flemmer watches Malkovich from above. He pulls out a
	walkie-talkie.

				 FLEMMER
			    (into walkie-talkie)
		    Okay, now!

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

	Lester is surrounded by all the Malkovichians. He holds
	the walkie-talkie, has just received word. He nods, and
	the Malkovichians crawl in single file into the portal,
	while shrieking a war cry.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

	Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.
	Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then
	by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with
	each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting
	out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich
	is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war
	cry and runs out onto the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.
	Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the
	audience.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (now sounding like fifty voices)
		    I am your earthly king! Kneel before
		    me!

	The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to
	their knees.

				 CROWD
			    (like automatons)
		    Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

	Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in
	the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.

	Lotte appears in the back of the theater, an out-of-breath
	figure in shadows. It is too late. She runs from the
	theater.

	Maxine watches, somewhat amused. She turns and heads for

	FADE OUT

	FADE IN

	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

	CHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK

	Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
	everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets,
	the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
	carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
	talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
	lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
	street looks up.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (fifty voices)
		    Greetings, my lowly subjects.

				 FLORIS
		    Great things, my lonely subtext?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (rolls his eyes)
		    Boy, be careful what you wish for.
			    (to Floris)
		    Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
		    will you?

	Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
			    (to the people on the street)
		    I am bored. You will dance for your
		    king now.

	Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
	void of expression. Malkovich laughs.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    Faster! Faster, my little trained
		    monkeys!

	The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
	exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
	help, nobody dares.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
	tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
	in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:

	A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT

	This place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards,
	cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
	totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
	position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
	animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
	and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
	gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Must you take this terrible demon
		    on yourself, my love?

				 LOTTE
		    Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
		    Malkovich and destroy him from the
		    inside. If not me, who?

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    If there was any way I could go in
		    your place. But I'm only a monkey
		    and...

				 LOTTE
			    (puts finger to his lips)
		    Hush, sweetheart.

	Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
	on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
	embrace.

				 LOTTE
			    (to the animals)
		    I'll be with you always, my friends.
		    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
		    rejoin you with wings and a beak.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
		    and a halo.

	Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
	into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

				 PARROT
			    (softly)
		    Good-bye. Good-bye.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY

	A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
	is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
	the others, and enters the building.

									CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
	the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
	She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
	door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
	and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS

	Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
	is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
	turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

				 LOTTE
		    My God!

				 CRAIG
		    I'm so glad you're safe. You look
		    really wonderful.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm in love. For the first time.
		    It's funny, but when it happens to
		    you, there's no question.

				 CRAIG
		    He's a lucky man.
			    (beat)
		    Do I know him?

				 LOTTE
		    It's Elijah.

				 CRAIG
		    The iguana?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
		    I'm sure he's a better lover than I
		    ever was.

				 LOTTE
		    A better friend.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    I'm sorry for everything.

				 LOTTE
			    (pecking him on the cheek)
		    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
		    in an odd sort of way.

				 CRAIG
		    You came up here looking for the
		    portal?

				 LOTTE
		    Yeah. I was going to kill him from
		    the inside.

				 CRAIG
		    And yourself too in the process. God,
		    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
		    see that before?

				 LOTTE
		    You saw it once. Now you see it again.
		    That's life, isn't it? And you were
		    up here to try the same thing, weren't
		    you?

				 CRAIG
		    I suppose. But they got here first,
		    the lousy bastards. So now it's all
		    over, I guess.

				 LOTTE
		    I don't know. There's a small
		    community of us. We have a place they
		    don't know about. We're happy. We'll
		    keep trying to figure out a way. Come
		    stay with us. Join the struggle.

				 CRAIG
		    You'll have me, after all I've done
		    to you?

				 LOTTE
		    People make mistakes.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
		    I just want you to know that.

				 LOTTE
		    I know.

				 CRAIG
		    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
		    help things grow, to encourage life.
		    Do you and your friends need a farmer?

				 LOTTE
		    Sure. We could really use a farmer.
		    We'd be grateful for the help.
			    (beat)
		    Also, I think, you know, if you
		    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
		    puppet show every once in a while,
		    would do a lot to lift our spirits.
		    You know, if you wouldn't mind too
		    terribly.

	Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

	She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
	elevator.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you, Lotte.

	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
	it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
	We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

				 MANTINI
			    (in Craig's voice)
		    I can't wait to see where you and your
		    friends live, Lotte.

				 LOTTE (O.S.)
		    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

				 FLEMMER
		    One serpent, coming up.

	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
	tunnel.

	THE END
BEING JOHN MALKOVICH

		   A Screenplay by Charlie Kaufman



	INT. CHEERLESS ROOM - DAY

	The room is bare, dusty. A ceiling fan turns. The 
	wall clock ticks. Craig, 30 years old and small, sits at
	a collapsible card table. The only item on the table is a
	book. Craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. It's entitled
	"Sit." Craig opens the book. It reads: "sit sit sit sit
	sit..." over and over, page after page. Craig closes the
	book. He begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs.
	He looks at the book again. It is now entitled "Die."  He
	opens it up.  "die die die die die..."  A rooster crows.


									CUT TO:


	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S BEDROOM - MORNING

	Craig jolts awake. A rooster stands on Craig's chest,
	crowing. Lotte, also 30, in the middle of dressing for 
	work, hurries in and pulls the bird from Craig's chest.


				 LOTTE
		    Sorry, hon. I didn't know Orrin
		    Hatch was out of his pen. Good
		    morning.


	Lotte leans down and kisses Craig on the forehead.

				 CRAIG
		    Morning.

				 LOTTE
		    Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms
		    coming in first thing.

				 CRAIG
		    Enjoy.

				 LOTTE
		    Craig, listen, honey, I've been
		    thinking... maybe you'd feel better
		    if you got, you know, a job or
		    something.

				 CRAIG
		    We've been over this. Nobody's
		    looking for a puppeteer in today's
		    wintry economic climate.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, you know, maybe something else
		    until this whole puppet thing turns
		    around.

				 CRAIG
			    (bitterly)
		    The Great Mantini doesn't need a day
		    job.

				 LOTTE
			    (sighs)
		    Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.
			    (beat)
		    Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me
		    a favor?

				 CRAIG
		    What?

				 LOTTE
		    Would you check in on Elijah? He seems
		    to be a little under the weather this
		    morning.

				 CRAIG
		    Which one is Elijah again?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. Okay.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE' S GARAGE - MORNING

	The place is a mess. Vivaldi blasts through cheap speakers.
	A small marionette stage stands in the back of the garage.
	The stage is lit and on it is a finely sculpted puppet 
	version of Craig. The "Craig" puppet paces back and forth, 
	wringing its hands with incredible subtlety. We see Craig,
	above and behind the stage. He is manipulating the puppet.
	His fingers move fast and furious. The puppet breaks into
	a dance, a beautiful and intricate balletic piece. Soon the
	puppet is leaping and tumbling through space, moves that one
	would think impossible for a marionette. Sweat appears on
	the real Craigs brow. His fingers move like lightning. The
	puppet moves faster and faster. Sweat appears on the puppet's
	brow. We see that the sweat is being piped from a special
	device that the real Craig controls. The Craig puppet
	collapses on the floor of the stage. It puts its hands up to
	its face and weeps. Craig hangs the puppet, and comes down
	around the front of the stage. He is heaving. He switches
	off the music, picks up a beer and takes a swig.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	The room is filled with penned and unpenned animals of all
	kinds: snakes, lizards, birds, a dog, cats, etc. Craig sits
	on the couch and looks at the want ads, the TV is on in the 
	background. Elijah, the monkey, sits next to Craig holding
	his stomach and moaning weakly. On the TV, Derek Mantini is
	working a 60 foot high marionette from the top of a water tower.
	The assembled crowd is enthralled.


				 TV ANNOUNCER
		    The crowd is enthralled as Derek
		    Mantini, arguably the greatest
		    puppeteer in the history of the 
		    world, performs "The Belle of
		    Amherst" with his 60 foot Emily
		    Dickinson puppet, directed by the
		    inimitable Charles Nelson Reilly.

	Charles Nelson Reilly floats by in a hot air balloon.

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    Beautiful, beautiful! Nyong-nyong.

				 CRAIG
		    Gimmicky bastard.

	Craig switches off the TV. He comes across an ad for a
	female puppeteer to teach at a girls school. Craig rubs 
	his chin in thought, then stands with great determination.

	The man picks up a crowbar leaning in the corner. He
	watches the floor numbers light up in succession. After

	The elevator slams to a halt. The man pries open the doors
	with the crowbar. Revealed is a standard office building

	The number on the wall across from the elevator is 7 1/2.

	Lester flips an intercom switch.

				 LESTER
		    Security.

				 CRAIG
		    No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with
		    your secretary.

				 LESTER
		    She's not my secretary. She's what
		    they call an executive liaison, and
		    I'm not banging her, if that's what
		    youre implying.

				 CRAIG
		    Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply
		    misspoke.

				 LESTER
		    Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you
		    feel you can bring to LesterCorp?

				 CRAIG
		    Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.

				 LESTER

				 CRAIG
		    You don't have a speech impediment,
		    Dr. Lester.

				 LESTER
		    Flattery will get you everywhere,
		    my boy. But I'm afraid I have to
		    trust Floris on this one. You see,
		    she has her doctorate in speech
		    impedimentology from Case Western.
		    Perhaps you've read her memoirs,
		    "I can't understand a word any of
		    you are saying."

				 CRAIG
		    No.

				 LESTER
		    Pity, it tells it like it is.
		    That's why the eastern, read Jewish,
		    publishing establishment won't touch
		    it. That's a quote from the book
		    jacket. George Will, I think.
			    (beat)
		    I apologize if you can't understan
		    a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.

				 CRAIG
		    No. I understand perfectly.

				 LESTER
			    (choking up)
		    Thank you for being kind enough to

		    in my isolated tower of
		    indecipherable speech. You're hired.
		    Any questions?

				 CRAIG
		    Just one. Why is this floor so short?

				 LESTER
		    Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the

		    Hello. Wendy.

				 WENDY
		    Don, I was wondering, do you know
		    why our workplace has such low
		    ceilings?

				 DON
		    It's an interesting story, Wendy.
		    Many years ago in the late 1800's,
		    James Mertin, an Irish ship captain
		    looking to invest in the future of
		    our great country, came to this town
		    and decided to erect an office
		    building.

									CUT TO:

	OLD FOOTAGE OF CONSTRUCTION CREW WORKING.

				 DON (CONT'D) (V.0.)
		    He would call this building the
		    Mertin-Flemmer Building, after
		    himself and someone else, who, local
		    legend has it, was named Flemmer.

		    One day. Captain Mertin received an
		    unexpected visitor.

	There is a knock at the door.

				 MERTIN
		    Enter ye, if ye dare enter.

	A tiny woman enters.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin?

				 MERTIN
		    What want ye, girl child?

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not a child, Captain Mertin,
		    but rather an adult lady of miniature
		    proportions.

				 MERTIN
			    (taken aback)
		    I see. Well, it is not my fault that
		    thou art tiny. So if it is charity
		    yer after, then be gone with ye,
		    ye foul demon.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    I am not asking for alms, but rather
		    the ear of a kind man with a noble
		    heart.

				 MERTIN
			    (sighs)
		    Aye. Speak then if ye must.

				 TINY WOMAN
		    Captain Mertin, surely I am a
		    God-fearing Christian woman like
		    yourself, but alas, I am afraid that
		    the world was not built with me in
		    mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs
		    are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms
		    mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie
		    lady, Captain. after all, who would
		    marry a person of my diminutiveness?
		    So I am forced to work for my few
		    pennies a week as an optometrist.
		    Why cannot there be a place for me
		    to work safe and comfortable?

	Mertin wipes a tear from his eye.

				 MERTIN
		    Woman, your story moves me like n
		    other. Me own sister was tiny and
		    then died. Therefore, I shall make
		    ye me wife. And I shall build a
		    floor in my building, between the
		    7th and 8th, which will be scaled
		    down, so from now on there shall
		    be at least one place on God's green
		    Earth that you and your accursed
		    kind can live in peace...

		    I am dubious, but I don't welsh.
		    Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven
		    o'clock. You're late, I walk. So
		    help me, if I find out you cheated.

				 CRAIG

	Craig walks down the hall. A tiny smile flits across
	Maxine's face.

	INT. JUICY JUICE BAR - EVENING

	Lester and Craig sit at a table. There are several emptied
	glasses of carrot juice in front of Lester. Craig nurses
	one glass, and keeps checking his watch.

				 LESTER
		    Imagine a room full of women.
		    Nubile, blonde, wet with desire,
		    Schwartz. A harem, if you will.
		    Me in leather. A harness, if you
		    like. I am the object of this
		    desire, and all eyes are on me as
		    I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am
		    the love god, Eros. I intoxicate
		    you. My spunk is to you manna from
		    heaven...

				 CRAIG
			    (standing)
		    Dr. Lester, it's been really
		    fascinating, but I'm afraid I have
		    to get home to my wife now.

				 LESTER
		    Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her,
		    Craig.

				 CRAIG
		    Yessir.

				 LESTER
		    Shall we say dinner on Friday.
		    Just the two of us?
			    (afterthought)
		    You can come too if you like,
		    Schwartz.

				 CRAIG
			    (checking watch)
		    That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta
		    run.

	Craig hurries to the door. Lester downs Craig's juice,
	signals the waiter for more.

									CUT TO:

	INT. THE STUCK PIG - NIGHT

	Maxine sits at the bar, watching her watch. Craig rushes
	into the room, frantic, out of breath. He spots Maxine and
	plops himself next to her.

				 CRAIG
		    Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine,
		    Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    Just.

				 CRAIG
		    Buy you a drink, Maxine?

				 MAXINE
		    You married?

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. But enough about me.

	Maxine laughs. The bartender approaches.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    What'll you have?

				 MAXINE
			    (to bartender)
		    The usual, Barry.

				 CRAIG
			    (to bartender)
		    I'll have, like, a beer. Like a
		    Budweiser, or something.

	The bartender walks away.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    I like you. I don't know what it
		    is exactly.

				 MAXINE
		    My tits?

				 CRAIG
		    No, no, it's your energy or your
		    attitude or the way you carry
		    yourself or...

				 MAXINE
		    Christ, you're not a fag are you?
		    Because I don't want to be wasting
		    my time.

	The drinks arrive. Maxine's is in an enormous fishbowl of
	a glass. It's bright blue, with fruit and marshmallows
	swimming in it. Paper umbrellas stick out of it, an
	plastic monkeys hang from the rim.

				 CRAIG
		    That's the usual?

				 MAXINE
		    Dont let the girly shit fool you.
		    It'd blow your shorts off.

	Maxine downs it like a shot of whiskey. She pushes the
	empty glass to the bartender.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
		    Set me up again, Barry.

	The bartender walks away with the empty glass.

				 CRAIG
		    Im not a homosexual. I just like
		    women for more than their bodies.
		    I guess you could say I'm the new
		    American male.

				 MAXINE
		    You're a fag or a liar.

				 CRAIG
			    (backpedaling)
		    I mean, I am really attracted to
		    you.

				 MAXINE
			    (mocking)
		    I mean, I am really attracted to
		    you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can
		    share recipes, if you like, Darlene.

	Maxine gets up.

				 CRAIG
			    (at a loss)
		    No, wait! I like your tits.
			    (beat)
		    I love your tits. I want to fuck
		    you.

				 MAXINE
			    (sitting)
		    Good. Now we're getting somewhere.
			    (beat)
		    Not a chance.

	Maxine's second drink comes. She downs it, pushes the
	glass toward the bartender.

				 MAXINE (CONTD)
		    So, tell me about yourself. If you
		    can get your mind out of the gutter
		    long enough, dog-boy.

				 CRAIG
		    Well, I'm a puppeteer...

	The bartender comes back with Maxine's drink.

		    Hi.

				 LOTTE
		    Hi.

				 CRAIG
			    (nervous, talking too much)
		    Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just
		    wouldn't let me go. Were supposed
		    to have dinner with him on Friday.
		    I can get us out of it if you want.
		    He's really amazing, this insane old
		    lech. It's actually sort of amusing
		    when you get past just how disgusting
		    it is.

	There is a silence. Lotte continues to comb out Elijah.
	Finally:

				 LOTTE
		    Did you eat?

				 CRAIG
		    Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I
		    didn't call. It was just, you know,
		    hard to get away.

				 LOTTE
		    I was worried.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. How was your evening?

				 LOTTE
		    Tom-Tom's puncture wound is
		    infected.

				 CRAIG
		    The ferret?

				 LOTTE
		    The iguana.

				 CRAIG
		    Right.

				 LOTTE
		    I dressed the wound. Then I've
		    just been feeding everyone, putting
		    everyone to bed.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah. You want a beer?

				 LOTTE
		    No thanks. I'm going to turn in.

				 CRAIG
		    All right. I'll be in my workshop
		    for a little while. I'll be in in
		    a little while. I need to unwind a
		    little.
			    (beat)
		    I'll be in soon. A little while.

				 LOTTE
		    'kay.

	Lotte exits.

	INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

	Craig works the Craig and Maxine puppets. The puppets
	sit on the edge of the small stage and chat. Craig does a
	pretty fair impersonation of Maxine's voice.

				 CRAIG
			    (as Maxine, fascinated)
		    Tell me, Craig, why do you love
		    puppeteering?
			    (as Craig)
		    Well, Maxine, I'm not sure exactly.
		    Perhaps it's the idea of becoming
		    someone else for a little while.
		    Being inside another skin. Moving
		    differently, thinking differently,
		    feeling differently.
			    (as Maxine)
		    Interesting. Would you like to be
		    inside my skin, Craig? Think what I
		    think? Feel what I feel?
			    (as Craig)
		    More than anything. Maxine.
			    (as Maxine)
		    It's good in here, Craig. Better
		    than your wildest dreams.

		    Hi.

				 MAXINE
		    You're not someone I could get
		    interested in. Craig. You play
		    with dolls.

				 CRAIG
			    (rehearsed)
		    Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea
		    of being inside someone else,
		    feeling what they feel, seeing
		    what they see...

				 MAXINE
		    Yikes.

				 CRAIG
		    Please, let me explain.

	Craig grabs Maxine's hand and drags her into an empty
	office.

									CUT TO:

	INT. EMPTY OFFICE - DAY

	Craig pulls Maxine in closes the door.

				 CRAIG
		    It's just, and I've never done
		    this before, Maxine, but it's just
		    that I feel something for you. I've
		    never felt this before for anyone,
		    not even my wife. My future is with
		    you, Maxine.

				 MAXINE
		    You might want to check those tarot
		    cards one more time.

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig sits on a box. He puts
	his head in his hands and sighs. Across the room he
	notices a very small door with a two by four nailed across
	it.

				 CRAIG
		    Another evil secret of the 7 1/2
		    floor.

	Craig pries the two-by-four off and opens the door. It's a
	dark and wet membranous tunnel inside.

				 CRAIG
		    Holy shit. Maxine is gonna love

		    never, never use it while bathing in

				 CRAIG
		    Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was

				 LESTER
		    Ah. yes, the little door.

	Maxine heads for the door. Craig grabs her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    This is important!

				 MAXINE
			    (looking at his hand on her arm)
		    It better be.

	Craig sits Maxine down in a chair, lets go of her arm.

				 CRAIG
		    There's a tiny door in that empty
		    office. It's a portal, Maxine. It
		    takes you inside John Malkovich.
		    You see the world through John
		    Malkovich's eyes, then, after about
		    fifteen minutes, you're spit out into
		    a ditch on the side of The New Jersey
		    Turnpike.

				 MAXINE
		    Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is
		    John Malkovich?

				 CRAIG
		    He's an actor. One of the great
		    American actors of the 20th century.

				 MAXINE
		    What's he been in?

				 CRAIG
		    Lots of things. He's very well
		    respected. That jewel thief movie,
		    for example. The point is that this
		    is a very odd thing, supernatural,
		    for lack of a better word. It raises
		    all sorts of philosophical questions
		    about the nature of self, about the
		    existence of the soul. Am I me? Is
		    Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha
		    right, is duality an illusion? Do
		    you see what a can of worms this
		    portal is? I don't think I can go
		    on living my life as I have lived
		    it. There's only one thing to do.
		    Let's get married right away.

				 MAXINE
		    Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?

				 CRAIG
		    Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.

				 MAXINE
		    Good. We'll sell tickets.

				 CRAIG
		    Tickets to Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.

				 CRAIG
		    But there's something profound here,
		    Maxine, we can't exploit it.

				 MAXINE
		    Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going
		    to offer a partnership to you, but
		    this way it's more money for me.

				 CRAIG
		    You wanted to be partners with me?

				 MAXINE
			    (bored)
		    Sure. It'd be fun.

				 CRAIG
			    (pleased)
		    Really?
			    (then:)
		    But, Maxine, can of worms! End of
		    the world! Illusory nature of
		    existence!

				 MAXINE
		    I'll protect you, Dollface.

				 LOTTE
		    Fuck pets. Is this your partner?

		    Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes.

				 CRAIG

		    Why aren't you at work?

				 LOTTE
		    I've been going over and over my

			    (beat)
		    I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't
		    that the craziest thing?

				 CRAIG
		    What, are you nuts? That's Oprah
		    talking.

				 LOTTE
		    Everything felt right for the first
		    time. I need to go back to make sure,
		    then if the feeling is still there.
		    I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman
		    about sexual reassignment surgery.

				 CRAIG
		    This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an

		    something, do it right.

				 CRAIG (cont'd)
			    (beat)
		    It's just the thrill of seeing through

		    How'd you get this number?

				 MAXINE (0.S.)
		    It's just that I fantasize about

		    Oh, I like this.

				 GUY
		    Excuse me, are you John Malkovich?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes.

				 GUY
		    Wow. You were really great in that
		    movie where you played that retard.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Thank you very much.

				 GUY
		    I just wanted to tell you that. And
		    say thank you. I have a cousin that's
		    a retard, so, as you can imagine, it
		    means a lot to me to see retards
		    portrayed on the silver screen so
		    compassionately.

	The guy walks away. Malkovich scans the room. Maxine enters
	the restaurant. We see her, but Malkovich doesn't single her
	out of the crowd. She looks around.

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    Maxine!

	Maxine spots Malkovich. and heads over. He focuses on her.

				 MAXINE
		    Hi. I'm so glad you decided to

	Maxine holds out her hand. She is charming. Malkovich takes
	her hand.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm John. I didn't think I was going
		    to come, but I felt oddly compelled.
		    I have to admit I was a bit intrigued

				 LOTTE (V.O.)
		    God, she's beautiful. The way she's
		    looking at me. At him. At us.

				 MAXINE
		    And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich,

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging
		    around his apartment. I think he must
		    be a lonely man.

				 CRAIG
		    You see, men can feel unfulfilled,
		    too. I'm glad you're realizing that.
		    You shouldn't be so quick to assume
		    that switching bodies would be the
		    answer to all your problems.

				 LOTTE
		    You're right. You know I was thinking
		    that we should have Maxine over for
		    dinner. Since you two are partners
		    and all. It might be a nice gesture.

				 CRAIG
		    I don't know. There's some tension
		    between us. I'd hate to expose you to
		    that.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna.

		    Did you know that Eskimos have not

		    because they have so much of it.

				 CRAIG
		    After dinner I'll show you my puppets.

				 MAXINE
		    Ah.

				 LOTTE
		    After that I'll introduce you to my

	There is another silence.

				 MAXINE
			    (to no one in particular) 
		    The way I see it, the world is divide
		    into those go after what they want
		    and those who don't. The passionate
		    ones, the ones who go after what they
		    want, may not get what they want, but
		    they remain vital, in touch with
		    themselves, and when they lie on
		    their deathbeds, they have few
		    regrets. The ones who don't go
		    after what they want... well, who
		    gives a shit about them anyway?

	Maxine laughs. There is another silence. Suddenly, at the
	same moment, both Craig and Lotte lunge for Maxine and
	start kissing her passionately about the face and neck.
	They stop just as suddenly and look at each other.

				 CRAIG
		    You?

	Lotte looks away.

				 MAXINE
		    Craig, I just don't find you
		    attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten
		    with you, but only when you're in
		    Malkovich. When I looked into his
		    eyes last night, I could feel you
		    peering out. Behind the stubble and
		    the too-prominent brow and the male
		    pattern baldness, I sensed your
		    feminine longing peering out, and
		    it just slew me.

				 CRAIG

				 LESTER
		    Thank you, Floris.

				 FLORIS (O.S.)
			    (intercom voice)
		    Think, Jew florist?

				 LESTER
			    (pressing line 2)
		    Good morning, Lotte!

				 LOTTE (O.S.)
		    Dr. Lester, everything's falling
		    apart.

	Craig is at the counter buying a pistol.

	INT. JUICY-JUICE JUICE BAR - MORNING

	Lester and Lotte sit at a table. They both have really
	large glasses of carrot juice in front of them.

				 LOTTE
		    I blew it, Dr. Lester.

				 LESTER
		    You followed your heart, my child,
		    and that is not necessarily a bad
		    thing.

				 LOTTE
		    But now we've lost access to Craig.

				 LESTER
			    (laughs)
		    My child, I don't think its a great
		    mystery what Craig's up to.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

	Craig stands still and tense, with gun in hand. We hear
	the front door unlock. Lotte enters. She does not see
	Craig. He grabs her from behind as she passes. Lotte
	screams. Craig holds the gun to her head.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed
		    to cherish me forever. Now you hold
		    a gun to my head?

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.

				 LOTTE
		    Suck my dick!

				 CRAIG
			    (slapping her)
		    Shut up!

	Lotte is stunned. She feels the muzzle against her forehead.
	She shuts up. Keeping the gun trained on Lotte, Craig
	dials the phone. He hands the receiver to her. He holds his
	ear to the receiver also.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    Tell her you need to see her.

				 LOTTE
			    (to Craig)
		    You bastard.

	Craig cocks the pistol.

				 MAXINE (V.O.)
		    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else
		    can be.

				 LOTTE
			    (looking at Craig)
		    I have to see you.

				 MAXINE (V.O.)
		    Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's
		    business hours. I need to keep the
		    membranous tunnel open for paying
		    customers.

				 CRAIG
			    (sotto)
		    Tell her, what the hell, close
		    early today, live dangerously.

				 LOTTE
		    What the hell, darling. Close early
		    today, live dangerously.

				 MAXINE (V.O.)
		    Oooh, doll. I love this new
		    devil-may-care side of you. Alrighty,
		    I'll track down Lover-boy, and I'll
		    see both of you in one hour.
		    Exactamundo.

	Maxine hangs up. Lotte hands the phone to Craig, who hangs
	it up. Craig opens up the big cage where Elijah is housed,
	and motions with the gun for Lotte to enter.

				 LOTTE
			    (screaming)
		    Help! He's locking me in a cage!

	Craig slaps Lotte hard. She looks at him, almost sadly.

				 NEIGHBOR
		    Shut up!

				 PARROT
		    Shut up!

				 CRAIG
		    Lesson number one:  Be careful what
		    you teach your parrot.

	Craig tapes Lotte's mouth, ties her hands and feet. Elijah
	watches him tie her. He becomes somewhat agitated, and
	holds his stomach.

	INT. BROADHURST THEATER - DAY

	Malkovich is rehearsing some business on stage. Maxine
	watches from the house. She anxiously checks her watch,
	then points to it so Malkovich can see.

		    Tommy, can I take fifteen?

									CUT TO:

	INT. MALKOVICH'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY

	Malkovich and Maxine are having sex on the make-up table,

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Lotte... Oh, sweetie...

	We now watch the scene from Malkovich's POV.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Maxine...

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
		    I can't believe it. This is too

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - DAY

	Craig is toweling himself off, hurriedly combing his
	hair. Maxine enters.

				 CRAIG
		    You're glowing again.

				 MAXINE
		    A girl has a right to glow if
		    she wants. It's in the fucking
		    constitution.

	Maxine sits. Craig smiles to himself.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING

	Craig is feeding the various caged animals. He puts two
	plates of food in Elijah's cage. Lotte is ungagged and
	unbound now. She eats as Craig slumps down next to the
	cage, gun in hand.

				 CRAIG
		    It was lovely being you being
		    Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen
		    the passionate side of sweet Maxine
		    before, or her actual tits for that
		    matter. If only, I've been thinking
		    to myself, if only I could actually
		    feel what Malkovich feels, rather
		    than just see what he sees... And
		    then, dare I say it, if only I could
		    control his arms, his legs, his
		    pelvis, and make them do my bidding.

				 LOTTE
		    It'll never happen, fuckface.

				 CRAIG
		    Ah, but you're forgetting one thing,
		    Lambchop.

				 LOTTE
		    What's that?

				 CRAIG
		    I'm a puppeteer.

	Craig picks up the phone and dials. He smiles as he
	holds the receiver up to Lotte's face.

	INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Malkovich and Maxine are having sex on Maxine's couch.

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte, this is so good...

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
			    (tense, commanding)
		    Move right hand across her left breast
		    now. Move right hand across her left
		    breast now. Move right hand across her
		    left breast now.

	Malkovich clumsily, awkwardly moves his hand across Maxine's
	breast.

				 CRAIG (V.O.) (CONT'D)
		    Holy shit, yes!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Holy shit, yes!

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
		    Holy shit! He said what I said!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Holy shit! He said what I said!

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte? Is that you?

				 CRAIG (V.O.)
		    Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
			    (scared)
		    What the fuck is going on? I'm not
		    talking. This is not me!

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Lotte...

	Maxine kisses Malkovich hard on the lips. There is a
	sucking sound.

	EXT. DITCH - NIGHT

	There is a pop and Craig lands in the ditch.

									CUT TO:

	INT. MAXINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A panicked Malkovich is pulling on his clothes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Something was making me talk. Some
		    Goddamn thing was making me move. I
		    gotta get out of here.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion
		    for me taking hold.

				 MALKOVICH
		    No, Dollface, I know what my passion
		    taking hold feels like. I gotta go.

	He leaves. Maxine falls back on the couch and sighs
	contentedly.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

	A wet, mess Craig sits next to Lotte's cage. Lotte is bound
	and gagged.

				 CRAIG
		    I did it, sweetie. I moved his arm
		    across your girlfriend's glorious tit.
		    I made him talk. And, oh, there was
		    the beginning of sensation in the
		    fingertips. Ummmm-mmmm! It's just a
		    matter of practice before Malkovich
		    becomes nothing more than another
		    puppet hanging next to my worktable.
		    Coffee?

									CUT TO:

	INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Malkovich paces nervously, a glass of whisky in his hand.
	Kevin Bacon sits on the couch and fiddles with a Rubic's
	Cube.

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's like nothing I've ever felt
		    before. I think I'm going crazy.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    I'm sure you're not going crazy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Kevin, I'm telling you... it was
		    like nothing I've...

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Yeah yeah yeah. Yadda yadda yadda.
		    Were you stoned?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes, but you see, someone else was
		    talking through my mouth.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You were stoned. Case closed. End
		    of story. How hot is this babe?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I think it might've been this Lotte
		    woman talking through me. Maxine
		    likes to call me Lotte.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you
		    to channel some dead lesbian lover.
		    Let me know when you're done with her.
		    This is my type of chick.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm done with her now. Tonight really
		    creeped me out.

				 KEVIN BACON
		    You're crazy to let go of a chick who
		    calls you Lotte. I tell you that as a
		    friend.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I don't know anything about her. What
		    if she's some sort of witch or
		    something?

				 KEVIN BACON
		    All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian
		    Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy.
		    Ha ha ha.

		    The truth is for suckers, Johnny-Boy.

	EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING

	Malkovich, in a baseball cap and sunglasses, leans against
	the wall. After a moment, Maxine emerges from the building
	and walks down the block. Malkovich follows at a safe
	distance.

									CUT TO:

	INT. 7 1/2 FLOOR - MORNING

	The elevator doors are pried open. It's packed. Maxine and
	a few other people climb out. The last to emerge is
	Malkovich. He is astounded by the dimensions of the floor.
	He turns the corner and sees the long line of crouching fat
	people. Maxine goes into the office and closes the door.
	Maxine sees "J.M. Inc." stenciled on the office door. He
	turns to the first fat man and line.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Excuse me, what type of service does
		    this company provide?

				 FAT MAN
		    You get to be John Malkovich for
		    fifteen minutes. Two hundred clams.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (quietly flipped)
		    I see.

				 FAT MAN
		    No cutting, by the way.

	Malkovich pounds on the door.

				 FAT MAN (CONT'D)
		    No cutting!

	Several fat people jump on Malkovich, and start beating
	him. Craig steps out of the office.

				 CRAIG
		    Hey! Break it up! Break it up!
		    Everybody gets a chance to be...

	The fat people climb off Malkovich. His glasses and cap
	have been knocked off and everyone recognizes him.

				 FAT MAN
		    It's him! Oh, we're so sorry Mr.
		    Malkovich! I hope me and my
		    associates from Overeaters Anonymous
		    didn't hurt you too terribly.

				 MAXINE
		    Darling!

				 MALKOVICH
		    What the fuck is going on?

				 CRAIG
		    Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig
		    Schwartz. I can explain. We operate
		    a little business her that...
		    simulates, for our clientele, the
		    experience of... being you, actually.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Simulates?

				 CRAIG
		    Sure, after a fashion.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try.

				 CRAIG
		    You? Why I'm sure it would pale in
		    comparison to the actual experience.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Let me try!

				 MAXINE
		    Let him try.

				 CRAIG
		    Of course, right this way, Mr.
		    Malkovich. Compliments of the house.

	Craig ushers Malkovich to the portal door, opens it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (repulsed by the slime)
		    Jesus.

	Malkovich climbs in. The door closes.

				 CRAIG
		    What happens when a man climbs
		    through his own portal?

	INT. MEMBRANOUS TUNNEL - DAY

	Malkovich crawls through. It's murky. He's tense. Suddenly
	there is a slurping sound.

									CUT TO:

	PSYCHEDELIC MONTAGE

	We see Malkovich hurtling through different environments.
	It's scary: giant toads, swirling eddies of garish, colored
	lights, naked old people pointing and laughing, black velvet
	clown paintings.

									CUT TO:

	INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Malkovich pops into a chair in a swakn night club. He's
	wearing a tuxedo. The woman across the table from him is
	also Malkovich, but in a gown. He looks around the
	restaurant. Everyone is Malkovich in different clothes.
	Malkovich is panicked. The girl Malkovich across the
	table looks at him seductively, winks and talks.

				 GIRL MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich
		    Malkovich...

	Malkovich looks confused. The Malkovich waiter approaches,
	pen and pad in hand, ready to take their orders.

				 WAITER MALKOVICH

	Malkovich looks down at the menu. Every item is "Malkovich."
	He screams:

				 MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich!

	The waiter jots it down on his pad.

				 WAITER MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich.

	Malkovich pushes himself away from the table and runs for
	the exit. He passes the stage where a girl singer Malkovich
	is singin sensuously into the microphone. She is backed by a
	'40's style big band of Malkoviches.

				 SINGING MALKOVICH
		    Malkovich Malkovich Malkovich

	Malkovich flies through the back door.

	EXT. DITCH - DAY

	Malkovich lands with a thud in the ditch. Craig is waiting
	there with his van. On its side is painted "See The World
	in Malk-O-Vision" followed by a phone number. Malkovich is
	huddled and shivering and soaking wet.

				 CRAIG
		    So how was it?

				 MALKOVICH
		    That... was... no... simulation.

				 CRAIG
		    I know. I'm sorry...

				 MALKOVICH
		    I have been to the dark side. I have
		    seen a world that no man should ever
		    see.

				 CRAIG
		    Really? For most people it's a rather
		    pleasant experience. What exactly did
		    you...

				 MALKOVICH
		    This portal is mine and must be sealed
		    up forever. For the love of God.

				 CRAIG
		    With all respect, sir, I discovered
		    that portal. Its my livelihood.

				 MALKOVICH
		    It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see
		    you in court!

	Malkovich trudges off along the shoulder of the turnpike.

				 CRAIG
			    (calling after him)
		    And who's to say I won't be seeing
		    what you're seeing... in court?

	Cars whiz by Malkovich. Someone yells from a passing car.

				 MOTORIST
		    Hey, Malkovich! Think fast!

	Malkovich looks up. A beer can comes flying out of the car
	and hits him on the head.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Craig is feeding the animals. His gun is stuck in his pants.
	He gets to Lotte's cage. She is bound but ungagged. She
	looks haggard.

				 LOTTE
		    Once this was a relationship based
		    on love. Now you have me in a cage
		    with a monkey and a gun to my head.

				 CRAIG
		    Things change. Anyway, you gave up your
		    claim to that love the first time you
		    stuck your dick in Maxine.

				 LOTTE
		    You fell in love with her first.

				 CRAIG
		    Yeah but I didn't do anything about
		    it. Out of respect for our marriage.

				 LOTTE
		    You didn't do anything about it out
		    of respect for the fact that she
		    wouldn't let you near her with a ten
		    foot pole, which is, by the way,
		    about nine feet, nine inches off
		    the mark anyway.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what
		    have I become? My wife in a cage
		    with a monkey. A gun in my hand.
		    Betrayal in my heart.

				 LOTTE
		    Maybe this is what you've always
		    been, Craig, you just never faced
		    it before.

				 CRAIG
		    Perhaps you're right. I can't let
		    you go though. Too much has happened.
		    You're my ace in the hole.

				 LOTTE
		    I need a shower.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm
		    some kind of monster. I'm the guy
		    you read about in the paper and go,
		    "he's some kind of monster."

				 LOTTE
		    You're not a monster, Craig. Just
		    a confused man.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you so much.

	She dials her phone, opens her cage, puts phone to her ear.

				 CRAIG (CONT'D)
		    But I gotta go now. I've got to go
		    be Johnny.

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...

				 LOTTE
		    We have to meet.

				 MAXINE
		    One hour.

	Craig hangs up, tapes Lotte's mouth.

				 CRAIG
		    I'll tell you all about it when I
		    get home.

	Craig exits. Lotte fiddles with the ropes on her hands
	Elijah, slumped in the corner of the cage, blankly
	watches her moving hands. Suddenly his eyes narrow.
	Something is going on in his brain. We move slowly into
	his eyes.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. JUNGLE - DAY

	It is a memory: blurry and overexposed, the color washed
	out. We see a weathered wooden sign which reads "Africa."
	The sound of running feet, huffing frantic breathing. We
	watch from up in a tree (Elijah's POV) as two men in safari
	suits chase a couple of chimps across the jungle floor. The
	chimps are screaming as the safari men tackle them and tie
	them up. The safari men laugh.

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Well, there monkeys ain't going
		    nowhere. Let's get us a couple a
		    brews 'fore the boss comes back...

	The safari men leave the chimps on the ground. We descend
	from the trees to the ground next to the bound chimps. One
	of the chimps looks at the camera. He grunts and squeals.

				 CHIMP ONE (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Son, untie your mother and me!
		    Quickly! Before the great bald
		    chimp-men return.

	A small pair of chimp hands enter into the frame and
	struggle to untie the ropes, but to no avail. Chimp two
	speaks.

				 CHIMP TWO (DUBBED VOICE)
		    Hurry, Elijah!

				 SAFARI MAN
		    Why you little bastard!

	Elijah is wrestled to the ground amidst much screaming.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Elijah shakes off the memory and looks determinedly at the
	ropes on Lotte's hands. He attempts to untie the knot. He
	works furiously and succeeds. Lotte pulls the tape from her
	mouth.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, Elijah, you are magnificent!

	Elijah beams and screams for ecstatic joy. Lotte unlocks
	the cage, and dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me
		    in John the last three times. Craig's
		    had me locked up in the apartment. He
		    made me call you at gunpoint. It's
		    been him! Oh, God, it's been him!

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
			    (beat, calmly)
		    Really? Well, you know, he's quite
		    good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have
		    a session with Malkovich I have to
		    attend. I'll speak with you soon.

				 LOTTE
		    But Maxine, I thought it was me you
		    loved.

				 MAXINE (O.S.)
		    I thought so too, doll. I guess we
		    were mistaken.

	Maxine hangs up. Lotte, visibly shaken, dials the phone.

				 LOTTE
		    Hello, Dr. Lester?

									CUT TO:

	INT. MALKOVICH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The doorbell rings. Malkovich answers it. Maxine stands

				 MALKOVICH
		    Come on in.

				 MAXINE
		    I can explain about the portal,
		    darling.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I
		    just let you up here to tell you
		    that, and to tell you that I'm taking
		    you and Schwartz to court.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh shut up.
			    (beat)
		    Craig, darling are you in there?

	Malkovich tenses up, then shakes his head in an awkward,
	puppet-like manner. When Malkovich speaks, it seems to be
	against him will.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yes. How did you know it was me?

				 MAXINE
		    Lotte called me.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Oh, so the bitch escaped.

				 MAXINE
		    Apparently you can control this
		    Malkovich fellow now.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm getting better all the time.

				 MAXINE
		    I'll say you are. Let's do it on his
		    kitchen table, then make him eat an
		    omelette off of it.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich)
		    No... damn... you...
			    (as Craig)
		    Oh shut up, you overrated sack of

	Malkovich begins undressing, and does a lewd bump and grind
	while looking mortified. Maxine giggles. Malkovich (Craig)
	laughs wildly.

	Lester's hand is in a bloody bandage. The juicer sits on hi
	desk. Lotte sits across from him looking nervous and
	hollow-eyed.

				 LESTER
		    You know I think it pays to leave
		    juice-making to the trained
		    professionals. You look terrible,
		    my dear.

				 LOTTE
		    Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr.
		    Lester.

				 LESTER
		    Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must
		    inform you that I find that highly
		    arousing.

				 LOTTE
		    No, you don't understand. I've been
		    inside Malkovich when I'm with
		    Maxine...

				 LESTER
			    (slaps Lotte furiously)
		    What?! That is not allowed. My God,
		    you are supposed to be one of us.
		    You know you must never partake of
		    Malkovich by yourself!

				 LOTTE
		    No, I didn't know that.

				 LESTER
		    Oh, didn't anyone show you the

				 LOTTE
		    No.

				 LESTER

	TITLE: SO YOU WANT TO BE JOHN MALKOVICH

	A much younger Lester addresses the camera in this black
	and white film, which seems to have been made in the 50's.

				 LESTER ON FILM
		    Welcome, my fellow Malkovichians.
		    As you may already know, today a
		    baby was born into this sad world.

	We see a shot of a newborn.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    His name is John Horatio Hannibal
		    Malkovich. And we are the keepers
		    of the door to his soul. One day,
		    when his brain is big enough, we
		    will all journey into his head and
		    live there for all eternity. Following
		    the teachings of our leader Karl Marx,
		    we will build the ultimate communist
		    community, one body and hundreds,
		    maybe thousands, of brains inside
		    working together to form a super
		    human intellect capable of curing
		    disease, stopping all war, and
		    ruling the world with a benevolent
		    fist. We will take a wife, a woman
		    of uncommon beauty and intellect, who
		    is, as yet, still an infant herself.

	We see a photo of another infant, this one with a ribbon in
	her hair.

				 LESTER ON FILM (CONT'D)
		    Her name is Floris Horatia Hannibella
		    DeMent.

				 LOTTE
		    Does Floris know that she's the
		    chosen?

				 LESTER
		    Well, I tried to explain it to her,
		    but...

	Lester points to his ear and shrugs.

	INT. MALKOVICH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

	Malkovich and Maxine lie naked on the bed, looking quite
	relaxed.

				 MAXINE
		    You still there, sweets?

				 MALKOVICH
		    Yeah. I've figured out how to hold
		    on as long as I want. Oddly enough,
		    it's all in the wrists.

				 MAXINE
		    Wow.
			    (little girl pout)
		    Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.

				 MALKOVICH
		    You mean with Malkovich?

				 MAXINE
		    I'd love to see your work.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (pleased)
		    Really? Yeah. Okay.

	Malkovich leans over and kisses her, then gets up.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    I'll do something I call "Craig's
		    Dance of Despair and Disillusionment."

	Malkovich performs the same dance that the Craig pupper
	did at the beginning of the film. It is exactly the same,
	complete with impossible somersaults and perspiring brow.
	He finishes by falling to his knees and weeping.

				 MAXINE
			    (moved)
		    That was incredible. You're brilliant!

				 MALKOVICH
		    You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing
		    with dolls.

				 MAXINE
		    You're right, my darling, it's
		    so much more. It's playing with
		    people!

	Malkovich kisses Maxine. She snuggles close to him.

				 MAXINE
		    Stay in him forever?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, screaming)
		    No!
			    (as Craig, calmly)
		    But how will we make a living,
		    my love, if our clientele doesn't
		    have access to our product?

				 MAXINE
		    Well, we'll have all the money in
		    Malkovich's bank account, plus he
		    still gets acting work occasionally.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (as Malkovich, breaking through)
		    No! Please!
			    (as Craig, to Malkovich)
		    Shut up, will you? We're trying to
		    think here.
			    (to Maxine)
		    It is sort of like being a puppeteer.
		    I like that about it.

				 MAXINE
		    No one would ever have to know its
		    not him.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (an idea)
		    Wait a minute! What if everybody knew?
		    What if we presented Malkovich as the
		    world's most complicated puppet and
		    me as the only puppeteer sophisticated
		    enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor
		    with the Great Mantini!

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - NIGHT

	The worshippers are assembled. Lotte stands before them.

				 LOTTE
		    I have sinned, unwittingly, against
		    the community. And for this I am
		    truly sorry.

				 MAN #2
		    W-w-what's it like on the inside?

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, it's glorious. It's indescribable.

				 MAN #2
		    Oooh, I wanna go. I wanna go. I say
		    it's time.

				 LESTER
		    Perhaps you're right, Terry. We're
		    all prepared, and perhaps this
		    Schwartz fellow is forcing our hand
		    a bit. We will enter the portal
		    tonight!

	Everyone cheers.

									CUT TO:

	INT. CRAIG AND MAXINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Maxine and Malkovich are furiously filling the portal
	with cement. Suddenly Malkovich stops and runs to the
	office door screaming a bloodcurdling scream. He stops
	just as suddenly, begins to strangle himself.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (Craig to Malkovich)
		    Shut up!
			    (to Maxine)
		    Sorry, dear, I lost control for
		    a minute.

				 MAXINE
			    (kissing him)
		    It's okay, my sweet.

	They go back to filling the portal. There is the sound
	of many shuffling feet in the hallway. The door flies
	open and the Malkovichians led by Lester and Lotte burst
	in. Malkovich and Maxine turn with a start.

				 LESTER
		    Aaaahhhh, the portal!

				 LOTTE
			    (to Malkovich)
		    You bastard!

	Lotte lunges for Malkovich. Lester grabs her arm, holds
	her back.

				 LESTER
		    No! Don't harm the vessel!

				 LOTTE
		    It's Craig in there, I can tell.

				 LESTER
		    I understand, but we must protect
		    the vessel at all costs.
			    (to Malkovich)
		    Please, Craig, please step aside
		    and allow us to have what is
		    rightfully ours.

				 CRAIG
		    Squatter's rights, Lester.

	Craig laughs somewhat maniacally. Maxine slips her arm
	through Craig's, joins him in his laughter, and glances
	triumphantly over at Lotte.

				 MAXINE
		    Now excuse us, we have an
		    entertainment legend to create.

				 LESTER
			    (to the cult members)
		    Clear the way for them, my friends.
		    They will be dealt with in due time.

	The Malkovichians grumble and let Malkovich and Maxine
	exit.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Now, let's see what we can do to
		    salvage this portal... for the sake
		    of all that is good.

	The Malkovichians converge on the sealed portal, and
	begin clawing desperately at the quick-drying cement.
	Fingers are scraped raw, and we see smears of blood and
	skin on the rough gray surface.

	INT. AGENT'S OFFICE - DAY

	A slick-looking agent answers a buzzing phone.

				 AGENT
		    Of course, send him right in. Don't
		    ever keep him waiting again. Do you
		    understand?

	Malkovich and Maxine enter. The agent stands, holds out
	his hand.

				 AGENT (CONT'D)
		    John! Great to see you! Sorry about
		    the cunt at reception.

				 MALKOVICH
		    This is my fiancee Maxine.

	The agent shakes Maxine's hand.

				 AGENT
		    Great to see you, Maxine. Sorry about
		    the cunt at reception. Please have a
		    seat.

	Malkovich and Maxine sit.

				 AGENT (CONT'D)
		    Can I get you anything? Coffee? Water?

				 MAXINE
		    No thanks.

				 AGENT
			    (into phone)
		    Teresa, get me a chicken soup.
			    (to Malkovich and Maxine)
		    Chicken soup?

	Maxine and Malkovich shake their heads "no."

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'll get right to the point, Larry.
		    I'm a puppet now...

				 AGENT
		    Okay.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm being controlled by the world's
		    greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...

				 AGENT
			    (no clue)
		    Oh yeah, he's good.

				 MALKOVICH
		    ... and I want to show off his skills
		    by performing a one-puppet
		    extravaganza in Reno.

				 MAXINE
		    Vegas.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Vegas. Can you arrange that?

				 AGENT
		    Sure, sure. Just let me make a

	The cult members are still there, now with picks 
	shovels. They are worn out and sweaty. The portal is
	excavated, but it seems ragged and destroyed. Man #2
	emerges from the hole, a rope tied around his waist.

				 MAN #2
		    That's the last of it, boss.

	Lester peers through the door.

				 LESTER
		    Well, let's see what we've got
		    here.

	Lester crawls into the tunnel, the door slams behind
	him.

									CUT TO:

	INT. PORTAL - CONTINUOUS

	Lester crawls through. There is a slurping sound and a
	flash of light.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BUNKER - DAY

	The scene is in black and white. Bombs are dropping.
	There is a blonde in forties clothes there. Lester
	views the scene through somebody's POV.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, where am I? This seems so
		    familiar.

	The person walks past a mirror. It's Hitler.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    My God, I'm Hitler in the bunker!
		    Aaaahhhh! Aaaah!

				 DIRECTOR
		    Cut!

	We look over to see a director and camera crew.

				 LESTER (V.O.)
		    Oh, I'm just the actor in that
		    Twilight Zone episode.

	There is a popping sound.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. DITCH - DAY

	Lester pops into the ditch. One of his cult members is
	waiting with a car, and looking hopeful. Lester sadly
	shakes his head "no."

									CUT TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - DAY

	The cult members mill about, drinking coffee, chatting.
	Lester enters with the cult member who picked him up at
	the ditch. All quiet down and look over at him.

				 LESTER
		    Thank you all for your efforts,
		    but I'm afraid we can no longer get
		    into Malkovich through the portal.

				 LOTTE
			    (panicky)
		    Why not? I need to get in there!

				 LESTER
		    I'm not certain, my dear, but I
		    believe your husband has somehow
		    psychically diverted the route.

				 LOTTE
		    That bastard! I'll gladly dispose
		    of him in the name of the order, Son
		    of Malkovich.

				 LESTER
		    I'm afraid that no physical harm
		    must come to him as long as he
		    inhabits the vessel.

				 MAN #3
			    (raises hand)
		    Oooh, I got an idea! What if we
		    build another portal to Malkovich,
		    like around back, and sneak in that
		    way?

				 MAN #4
		    Only Captain Mertin knew how to build
		    a portal, dummy, and he's dead!

				 LESTER
		    Actually, my friends, I suppose its
		    time I told you, I'm Captain James
		    Mertin.

	The members fall into a stunned silence. Lester takes
	some refrigerator magnets and spells out L-E-S-T-E-R on
	a board. He then rearranges them for a while.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    You see, Lester is an anagram for
		    Mertin.

	Lester continues to rearrange the letters, getting a little
	tense now.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    It used to work, I'm sure of it.

	Several members check their watches.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Oh, damn it to hell. Anyway, I am.

	L-E-S-T-E-R has been left as E-L R-E-S-T as Lester turns
	from the board to face the congregation.

				 MAN #3
		    How can this be? I thought you were
		    only one hundred and five years old.
		    Mertin would have to be...

				 LESTER
			    (chuckles amiably)
		    I'm two hundred and five, truth be
		    told.

				 WOMAN #1
			    (flirtatiously)
		    You don't look a day over one
		    hundred and five, Captain. What's
		    your secret?

				 LESTER
		    Lots of carrot juice, little lady.
		    That, and a deal with the Devil.

	There is a lot of murmuring in the room now.

				 MAN #2
		    So what exactly are you saying? Are
		    we in cahoots with the Dark Master
		    here?

				 LESTER
		    Surprise.

	The cultists get tense, start to leave en masse.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    Wait! It's not that bad! When we get
		    into Malkovich, we still get to rule
		    the world, just like I told you. The 
		    only difference is that we rule in the
		    name of evil, instead of good.

	People stop in their tracks.

				 MAN #3
		    That's the only difference?

				 LESTER
		    Absolutely.

	The cultists think about is, then shrug and stay put.

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
		    So anyway...

	Lotte stands.

				 LOTTE
		    Well, I for one, am resigning. I will
		    not serve evil. I am ashamed of all
		    of you.

	Lotte heads for the door.

				 LESTER
		    My dear, let me assure you that when
		    we attain power, it will be much more
		    pleasant for those inside Malkovich,
		    than for those outside.

	Lotte stops and turns.

				 LOTTE
		    I'll take my chances.

	She exits.

				 LESTER
		    Anybody else?

				 WOMAN #1
		    Do we get to wear a crown?

				 LESTER
		    But of course.

				 WOMAN #1
		    Count me in.

				 LESTER
		    Good. I think its time to beckon
		    Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us
		    out of this pickle.

									FLIP TO:

	INT. LESTER'S SHRINE ROOM - A BIT LATER

	Mr. Flemmer, a silver-haired gentleman in turtleneck and
	blazer, scratches his head. The cultists patiently watch
	him.

				 FLEMMER
		    Boy, this is a toughie. To be honest,
		    I didn't anticipate this.

				 LESTER
		    And as I said, sir, we can't very
		    well exert physical persuasion upon
		    the sacred vessel Malkovich.

				 FLEMMER
		    Right, Lester. I heard you the first
		    time. I'm not a dummy.

				 LESTER
		    Didn't mean to imply that you were,
		    sir.

				 FLEMMER
		    Look, I'm going back to my house
		    to ponder this. So stay calm and
		    keep track of Schwartz's comings
		    and goings. Oh, and somebody dispose
		    of Schwartz's wife, will you?
			    (to cultists)
		    Nice to meet you all.

	The cult members ad-lib "same here, sir."

	INT. CRAIG AND LOTTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Lotte site in the living room, in her pajamas, softly
	sobbing. The caged animals watch her.

				 LOTTE
		    Oh, my friends. Be thankful you're
		    not human. People are treacherous
		    and greedy and corrupt. I've lost
		    my heart to two of them and I almost
		    lost my soul to another. And I'm no
		    better. Look at the way I keep you,
		    locked in cages, for my own enjoyment.
		    Well, I've been in a cage too, my
		    friends. Literally and figuratively.
		    So tonight I set you free.

	Lotte opens the windows and the front door, then unlocks
	all the cages. The animals scurry and fly out of their
	cages, and out of the house. Lotte watches silently until
	she is alone.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Good-bye, friends.

	A hand reaches for hers. She looks down. Elijah is still
	there and holding her hand. She smiles.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Hello, friend

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

	We see the menagerie of animals on the otherwise deserted

	Lotte and Elijah see the dark figure coming up the steps.
	The buzzer rings. Lotte and Elijah jump.

				 LOTTE
		    They've come to kill me, Elijah. See,
		    I know too much. I should get the

	Elijah looks at her sweetly, a great sadness in his eyes.
	Then he leads her by the hand out the window.

		    onto that stage a nobody and
		    presto-change-o, you're coming
		    back the greatest puppeteer the
		    world has ever seen.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting
		    me hard today.

	Malkovich jerks a bit, gets it under control.

				 MAXINE
		    Doesn't he know how important
		    tonight is to us?

				 MALKOVICH
		    He's a selfish bastard.

									CUT TO:

	INT. LAS VEGAS THEATER - NIGHT

	The house is filling with formally dressed audience members.
	The cultists and Lester, also in tuxes and gowns, are among
	them. The lights go down.

				 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
		    Ladies and gentlemen, it is the
		    great privilege of the Luxor hotel
		    and Casino to present Craig Schwartz
		    and his magical puppet John
		    Malkovich.

	The orchestra starts up. The curtains part.

				 LESTER
		    Blasphemous bastard.

	Malkovich tap dances out onto the stage. He is amazingly
	nimble and the audience "oohs" and "aahs."

				 LESTER (CONT'D)
			    (grudgingly)
		    Pretty good though.

	Malkovich does an amazing triple somersault, lands on one
	knee and, with spread arms, begins singing: "Kiss Today
	Goodbye."  in a beautiful tenor. The orchestra catches up
	with him. The audience goes wild. A pretty-boy young man
	with a big tousle of black hair and a shiny, tight suit
	appears at the back of the house. An usher glances over at
	him.

				 USHER
		    Oh, Mr. Mantini! We weren't expecting
		    you tonight, sir. Um, I'm afraid
		    there's not an empty seat in the
		    entire house.

				 MANTINI
			    (not taking his eyes from the stage)
		    Make one empty.

				 USHER
		    Y-y-y-es sir.

	The usher looks nervously around for someone to boot.
	Martini waits in the back. On stage, Malkovich is now
	performing the "back of the car scene" from "On The
	Waterfront."  He alternates between the Marlon Brando part
	and the Rod Steiger part, moving back and forth from one
	stool to the another. He performs it magnificently. We see
	Lester in the audience wiping a small tear from his eye.

				 LESTER
		    Not too shabby.

	Mantini is now sitting in a good aisle seat next to a 
	beautiful woman. Her boyfriend is being hauled toward the
	exit by the usher. The beautiful woman watches, with some
	concern, as the boyfriend is taken away. Then she turns and
	smiles flirtatiously at Mantini. Mantini smiles back. On
	stage Malkovich is dressed in a ringmaster's outfit and
	juggling chainsaws.

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing more than a Goddamn clown.

	At this point the entire audience stands and gives Malkovich
	a spontaneous standing ovation. All except Mantini. Even the
	cultists get up.

									CUT TO:

	INT. SEWER - NIGHT

	Lotte sits sadly in the wet tunnel. She is scrunched-up
	against the damp cold. A small fire smolders in front of
	her. We hear footsteps approaching. It is Elijah, carrying
	supplies:  food and blankets. He covers her with a blanket
	and sits down next to her.

				 LOTTE
		    They're going to take over the
		    world, Elijah. Evil will reign.
		    But, then, evil already reigns,
		    doesn't it? So what difference
		    does it make if John Malkovich
		    is wearing the fucking crown while
		    it's reigning?

	Elijah sighs, then holds his stomach. The ulcer is
	returning.

									CUT TO:

	INT. FLEMMER'S APARTMENT - DAY

	It's a conservatively furnished upper westside apartment.
	Looks like it belongs to a Columbia professor. The walls
	are lined with books. Mr. Flemmer sits at his desk, his
	head in his hands, deep in thought. The doorbell rings.

				 FLEMMER
		    It's open.

	The door opens and Lester pokes his head in.

				 LESTER
		    It's just me, boss. I brought
		    croissants.

	Lester enters with a greasy white paper bag.

				 FLEMMER
		    Have a seat. I wracking my brain
		    over this Malkovich thing.

				 LESTER
		    We saw his show at the Luxor last
		    night.

				 FLEMMER
			    (impressed)
		    Vegas? What'd you think?

				 LESTER
		    The kid's got talent. You've never
		    seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz
		    had him up there singing and dancing.
		    Impressions.

				 FLEMMER
		    Impressions? Those are hard.

				 LESTER
		    Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad
		    we can't kill him.

				 FLEMMER
		    I suppose I could come to him in a
		    dream. I don't know. That's the best
		    I can think of right now.

				 LESTER
		    A scary dream?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, a sexy dream. Of course, a scary
		    dream.

				 LESTER
			    (noncommittally)
		    I like that.

									CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT

	Malkovich sits on the floor in silk pajamas. He is
	surrounded by newspaper clippings. He is drinking
	champagne from the bottle. Maxine is at a dressing
	table, brushing her hair.

				 MAXINE
		    Oh, darling. It's a dream come true.
		    We're going to ride this straight to

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sleepy suddenly.

				 MAXINE
		    Busy day, my little fire chief. Why
		    don't you climb into bed, and I'll
		    meet you there in just...

	But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of
	his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts 
	blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	INT. HELL - NIGHT

	Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of
	flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened.
	He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away
	from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking
	the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister
	grin.

				 CRAIG
		    Who are you?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh.

				 FLEMMER
		    Leave Malkovich. He is mine.

				 CRAIG
		    Okay. Sorry. I didn't know.

									CUT TO:

	INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS

	Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him.

				 MAXINE
		    Bad dream, darling?

				 MALKOVICH
		    I've got to leave Malkovich.

				 MAXINE
		    You've got to be kidding.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I just had the most horrifying
		    nightmare. The devil was in it.

	Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased
	with himself.

				 MAXINE
		    Malkovich is our meal ticket. You
		    can't back out because of some
		    stupid dream.

				 FLEMMER
			    (to himself)
		    Shit.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Honey, we can be happy and poor
		    together.

				 MAXINE
			    (laughs derisively)
		    Perhaps you'll want to consult that
		    Ouija board again.

	There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry.

				 MAXINE (CONT'D)
		    Yeah what?!

				 MALKOVICH
		    Derek Mantini!

	Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and
	Maxine give each other the once over.

				 MANTINI
			    (still eyeing Maxine)
		    Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Did you see the reviews?

				 MANTINI
		    Yeah, I saw them

				 MALKOVICH
		    Because if you missed any, I just
		    happen to have copies here you can
		    take with you when you leave now.

				 MAXINE
		    I'm Maxine. I produced the evening
		    with Malkovich.

				 MANTINI
		    Very impressive. I could use a
		    producer with your vision. And
		    other outstanding attributes.

				 MALKOVICH
		    She's not available.

				 MANTINI
		    We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MAXINE
		    Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see.

				 MANTINI
		    I won't waste your time Schwartz, or
		    more importantly, mine. Here's my
		    proposal: There's only room in this
		    world for one "World's Greatest
		    Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow
		    the puppet-going public to crown
		    their king.

				 MALKOVICH
		    How do we do that?

				 MANTINI
		    A friendly competition, if you will.
		    Your Malkovich puppet and my Harry S.
		    Truman puppet appear opposite each
		    other in a play. Not some Vegas
		    Burly-Q pyrotechnics, but a real play
		    that requires actual acting. The
		    audience decides who is more deserving
		    of the title. The losing puppeteer
		    bows out graciously. Goes back to
		    obscurity as a file clerk.

				 MALKOVICH
		    What's the play?

				 MANTINI
		    Say... "Equus"? It's got everything.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Never heard of it.

				 MANTINI
		    Broadway's finest three hours. It's
		    about the suppression of the
		    individual. Conformity as God in
		    modern society.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Sounds boring. Are there any songs?

				 MANTINI
		    Nothing but acting to hide behind,
		    buddy-boy.

				 MALKOVICH
		    I'm not afraid. I toured for a year
		    with the National Puppet Company's
		    production of "Long Day's Journey
		    Into Night."

				 MANTINI
		    Great then.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Is there dancing?

				 MANTINI
		    No.

				 MALKOVICH
		    Who needs dancing?

	Lester is watering Flemmer's plants. A key is heard in the

				 LESTER
		    How'd it go? Did you say the
		    philodendron gets water or no?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, for God's sake, I just watered
		    it yesterday.
			    (beat)
		    It almost went well. I gave a pretty
		    good dream, but circumstances arose.

				 LESTER
		    What kind of circumstances?

				 FLEMMER
		    Maxine says she'll leave him if he
		    leaves Malkovich, plus he's been
		    challenged to a puppet-duel by
		    Mantini.

				 LESTER
		    The Great Mantini?

				 FLEMMER
		    No, the Mediocre Mantini. Of course
		    the Great Mantini!

				 LESTER
		    Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I
		    saw him do "Tru" with his sixty
		    foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.

				 FLEMMER
		    But I think I have another plan.

				 LESTER
			    (snippy)
		    Do tell. I love a good plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Why are you being like this?

	Lester shrugs.

				 LESTER
		    I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me
		    the plan.

				 FLEMMER
		    Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will
		    leave Malkovich, right? So, if he
		    needs it, I help Mantini's performance
		    a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the
		    show.

				 LESTER
		    Can you do that? I mean, do you know
		    anything about puppetry?

				 FLEMMER
		    I am the Devil, Lester. I think I can
		    handle it.

				 LESTER
		    I was just asking. No disrespect
		    intended.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. Let's drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. I mean, it's not like I was
		    doubting you, it's just that I know
		    puppetry is a skill that takes a long
		    time to acquire.

				 FLEMMER
		    Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.

				 LESTER
		    Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen

	The house is packed. On stage is a minimalist set: wood
	planks and metal poles. Six guys in brown turtlenecks and
	stylized wire horse heads mill about. The 60 foot Harry S.
	Truman puppet is pacing, his strings extending up into the
	flyspace and out of sight. Malkovich sits on a bench. Truman
	and Malkovich both take stabs at British accents.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Do you dream often?

		    Do you?

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    It's my job to ask the questions.

		    That Truman puppet is downright

		    He was much better in Vegas when he

	Flemmer materializes behind Mantini

				 CHARLES NELSON REILLY
		    What the hell? Nyong-nyong!

	Mantini spins around to face Flemmer. Reilly makes a break
	for it. Flemmer points a finger and Reilly freezes in
	mid-strut. Flemmer then points a finger at Mantini, and he,
	too, freezes. Flemmer picks up the giant wooden controls
	for the marionette, and pulls a copy of the play from his

									CUT TO:

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - NIGHT

	We watch the second act in progress. The Truman puppet pace
	as he delivers a monologue. Somehow he doesn't even seem to
	be a puppet anymore, so subtle and graceful are his
	movements and the changes in his facial expressions. It's
	as if there's a giant actual Harry Truman on stage.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    I can hear the creature's voice. It's
		    calling me out of the black cave of
		    the Psyche. I shove in my dim little
		    torch, and there he stands -- waiting
		    for me. He raises his matted head. He
		    opens his great, square teeth and says
			    (mocking)
		    'Why? ... Why me? ... Why --
		    ultimately -- Me? ... Do you really
		    imagine you can account for Me?
		    Totally, infallibly, inevitably

	bravura performance. He glances out into the audience and
	sees a silent, rapt crowd.

	Malkovich is delivering a monologue. Acting up a storm.
	During Malkovich's speech, Truman repeatedly attempts to

	INT. BROADHURST STAGE - LATER STILL

	Malkovich is in convulsions on the floor. Big dramatic
	convulsions. Truman scoops him up, and places him on the
	bench. Malkovich continues with the convulsions, milking
	it. Truman speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    Here ... Here ... Sssh ... Sssh ...
		    Calm now ... Lie back. Just lie back!
		    Now breathe in deep. Very deep. In ...
		    Out ... In ... Out ... That's it ...
		    In. Out .. In ... Out ...

	Malkovich is breathing insanely now, trying to keep the
	focus on himself. Flemmer is in the catwalks, watching the
	crowd. The audience is watching Malkovich.

				 AUDIENCE MEMBER
			    (to his wife)
		    That Malkovich puppet is a damn fine
		    actor.

				 FLEMMER
			    (blood boiling)
		    Bastard is stealing my thunder.

	Malkovich and Truman on the stage. Truman is pacing,
	swirling, dancing, juggling enormous bowling pins as he
	talks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET
		    All right! I'll take it away! He'll be
		    delivered from madness. What then?
		    He'll feel himself acceptable! What
		    then?

	Malkovich has upPed his convulsions now. He watches Truman
	out of the corner of his eye while writhing tormentedly on
	the bench. He levitates. Spins in mid-air. Falls on all
	fours and does an uncanny impression of a yelping dog.
	Truman watches Malkovich, continues to speak. But now, when
	he talks, fire comes out of his mouth.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    I'll heal the rash on his body. I'll
		    erase the welts cut into his body by
		    flying manes.

	The audience "ooohs" at the flames. Malkovich rips off his
	clothes and convulses into the dying swan-bit from "Swan
	Lake." The audience applauds. Truman continues his speech,
	now transforming himself into an actual 60 foot swan and
	flying around the auditorium as he speaks.

				 HARRY S. TRUMAN PUPPET (CONT'D)
		    You won't gallop anymore, Alan. Horses
		    will be quite safe. You'll save your
		    pennies every week, till you can
		    change that scooter into a car...

	The audience watches the giant swan overhead, necks craned,
	in awe. Malkovich sighs. He is out of his league. He goes
	into a remarkable tap dance routine and sings "Mr.
	Bojangles", but nobody even looks at the stage. The giant
	swan bursts into flames, flies back onto the stage, burns
	to a crisp, then rises from his ashes as the actual Harry S.
	Truman. Truman looks confused and disoriented, as if just
	raised from the dead.

				 ACTUAL TRUMAN
		    Where am I? Aren't I dead?
			    (possessed)
		    Vote for Mantini!

	Truman grows and grows until he is again just a giant
	puppet. The audience bursts into applause, then delivers a
	standing ovation. Truman bows. Flemmer laughs wildly in the
	catwalks. Malkovich walks dejectedly from the stage.

									CUT TO:

	Maxine watches as Malkovich pulls himself up off the ground.
	Suddenly, he is again possessed, first by one person, then
	by two, then by three, his body jerking and pulsating with
	each new occupant. It's almost like popping corn, starting
	out slowly, then going faster and faster, until Malkovich
	is possessed by all fifty Malkovichians. He shrieks a war
	cry and runs out onto the stage.

									CUT TO:

	INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

	The Truman puppet now hangs limply from the catwalks.
	Malkovich hovers just above the stage and addresses the

		    me!

	The audience scoffs at first, but then are compelled to
	their knees.

				 CROWD

		    Hail Malkovich, king of the damned.

	Malkovich laughs, gives the thumbs up sign to Flemmer in
	the catwalks. Flemmer gives the thumbs up sign back.

	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - DAY

	CHYRON:  LATER THAT WEEK

	Something is wrong. It's a typical midtown street, but
	everything is painted gray:  the buildings, the streets,
	the sidewalks, the cars. People walk along the streets,
	carrying gray briefcases, wearing gray jumpsuits. Nobody
	talks, nobody smiles. Gray birds fly silently in the sky.
	There is no noise whatsoever. There are several movie
	theaters on the block. All marquees advertise John Malkovich
	movies. Around the corner comes Malkovich. He is floating
	about ten feet off the ground on an enormous, bright red,
	jeweled throne. He wears a gold crown and purple silk robe
	and smiles condescendingly, majestically. Floris sits on his
	lap. She is dressed in an orange satin gown. Nobody on the
	street looks up.

				 MALKOVICH
			    (fifty voices)
		    Greetings, my lowly subjects.

				 FLORIS
		    Great things, my lonely subtext?

				 MALKOVICH
			    (rolls his eyes)
		    Boy, be careful what you wish for.
			    (to Floris)
		    Never mind, dear. Just enjoy the ride,
		    will you?

	Floris shrugs, picks at her finger nails.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
			    (to the people on the street)
		    I am bored. You will dance for your
		    king now.

	Without pause the entire street of gray clad people breaks
	into a meticulously choreographed production number. Totally
	silent, totally joyless, but exquisitely executed. We see
	that Maxine is one of the anonymous dancers. Her face is
	void of expression. Malkovich laughs.

				 MALKOVICH (CONT'D)
		    Faster! Faster, my little trained
		    monkeys!

	The crowd dances faster and faster. Older people fall over,
	exhausted, clutching their hearts. Nobody stops dancing to
	help, nobody dares.

									CUT TO:

	EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

	Bird's eye view of the park. It's all painted gray. Every
	tree, every leaf. There's no sign of life. The camera moves
	in, through some gray trees and gray brush to:

	A LUSH GREEN OASIS CAMOUFLAGED ON THE TOP AND SIDES WITH GRAY PAINT

	This place is filled with life:  Colorful birds, lizards,
	cats, a rooster. All the animals are active, happy, but
	totally silent, as if they know the precariousness of their
	position. Lotte and Elijah sit among them. These are the
	animals that she freed earlier. Lotte and Elijah hold hands
	and look into each other's eyes. We see that they both wear
	gold bands. They are husband and wife. Elijah signs.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Must you take this terrible demon
		    on yourself, my love?

				 LOTTE
		    Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter
		    Malkovich and destroy him from the
		    inside. If not me, who?

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    If there was any way I could go in
		    your place. But I'm only a monkey
		    and...

				 LOTTE
			    (puts finger to his lips)
		    Hush, sweetheart.

	Lotte slips into a gray jumpsuit. She stuffs a homemade bomb
	on her pocket. She and Elijah kiss passionately, then
	embrace.

				 LOTTE
			    (to the animals)
		    I'll be with you always, my friends.
		    Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll
		    rejoin you with wings and a beak.

				 ELIJAH (SUBTITLES)
		    Wings and a halo, my darling. Wings
		    and a halo.

	Lotte turns quickly. This is too much to bear. She descends
	into a storm drain. The animals stop what they're doing.

				 PARROT
			    (softly)
		    Good-bye. Good-bye.

									DISSOLVE TO:

	EXT. MERTIN-FLEMMER BUILDING - DAY

	A man-hole cover lifts. Lotte pokes her head out. The coast
	is clear. She emerges. Assumes the dead-eyed expression of
	the others, and enters the building.

									CUT TO:

	INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

	Lotte watches the floors change. After seven, she presses
	the emergency stop button. The elevator jerks to a halt.
	She picks up the crow bar in the corner, pries open the
	door. The 7 1/2 floor is gone. Nothing is there but pipes
	and wires and beams. She climbs out onto the floor.

									CUT TO:

	INT. BETWEEN FLOORS - CONTINUOUS

	Lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. It
	is nowhere to be found. There is a noise behind her. She
	turns with a start. It's Craig, ragged and ill-shaven.

				 LOTTE
		    My God!

				 CRAIG
		    I'm so glad you're safe. You look
		    really wonderful.

				 LOTTE
		    I'm in love. For the first time.
		    It's funny, but when it happens to
		    you, there's no question.

				 CRAIG
		    He's a lucky man.
			    (beat)
		    Do I know him?

				 LOTTE
		    It's Elijah.

				 CRAIG
		    The iguana?

				 LOTTE
		    The monkey.

				 CRAIG
		    Oh, right. As long as you're happy.
		    I'm sure he's a better lover than I
		    ever was.

				 LOTTE
		    A better friend.

				 CRAIG
			    (beat)
		    I'm sorry for everything.

				 LOTTE
			    (pecking him on the cheek)
		    It's okay, Craig. It all worked out,
		    in an odd sort of way.

				 CRAIG
		    You came up here looking for the
		    portal?

				 LOTTE
		    Yeah. I was going to kill him from
		    the inside.

				 CRAIG
		    And yourself too in the process. God,
		    you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I
		    see that before?

				 LOTTE
		    You saw it once. Now you see it again.
		    That's life, isn't it? And you were
		    up here to try the same thing, weren't
		    you?

				 CRAIG
		    I suppose. But they got here first,
		    the lousy bastards. So now it's all
		    over, I guess.

				 LOTTE
		    I don't know. There's a small
		    community of us. We have a place they
		    don't know about. We're happy. We'll
		    keep trying to figure out a way. Come
		    stay with us. Join the struggle.

				 CRAIG
		    You'll have me, after all I've done
		    to you?

				 LOTTE
		    People make mistakes.

				 CRAIG
		    I'm through with puppets, Lotte.
		    I just want you to know that.

				 LOTTE
		    I know.

				 CRAIG
		    I'd like to be a farmer. I want to
		    help things grow, to encourage life.
		    Do you and your friends need a farmer?

				 LOTTE
		    Sure. We could really use a farmer.
		    We'd be grateful for the help.
			    (beat)
		    Also, I think, you know, if you
		    wouldn't mind too terribly, a little
		    puppet show every once in a while,
		    would do a lot to lift our spirits.
		    You know, if you wouldn't mind too
		    terribly.

	Craig's eyes well up with tears. Lotte looks at him sweetly.

				 LOTTE (CONT'D)
		    Oh honey. It's gonna be okay.

	She puts her arm around him and leads him toward the
	elevator.

				 CRAIG
		    I love you, Lotte.

	We come on very close to Craig's arm as he lifts it to put
	it around Lotte. We see a thin almost invisible filament.
	We follow it up, and discover that Craig is now a
	marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless
	Mantini in a gray jumpsuit.

				 MANTINI
			    (in Craig's voice)
		    I can't wait to see where you and your
		    friends live, Lotte.

				 LOTTE (O.S.)
		    It's beautiful, Craig, like Eden.

	Now we see filaments attached to Mantini's arms, and w
	follow them up to find that Flemmer is controlling Mantini.

				 FLEMMER
		    One serpent, coming up.

	Flemmer throws his head back and laughs. The camera moves
	into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough,
	looks exactly like the membranous John Malkovich portal
	tunnel.

Shelly's out, walking down the street, ten times a week!  I read it!  I 
said it!  I stole my momma's credit!  I'm cool!  I'm hot!  Sock me in 
the stomach three more times!

JOSH
Don't forget to call me after supper.

BILLY
Okay.

JOSH
Remember about Cynthia!

BILLY
Don't worry!  I'm as interested as you are.

SCENE 5

JOSH
So, will you tell me?

BILLY
You're in!

JOSH
What do you mean, I'm in?

BILLY
Cynthia Benson!

JOSH
What about her?

BILLY
You ready for this?  She doesn't like Barry anymore!

JOSH
So?

BILLY
So what do you mean so?!  That's it!  She's available!

MOM
Josh...?

JOSH
It doesn't mean...

MOM
Hey, it's after midnight.  Now say goodnight to Billy.

JOSH
Goodnight Billy.  I've gotta go.

BILLY
Goodnight Mrs. Baskin!  Sweet dreams.

SCENE 6

DAD
Are you sure you want to go on this thing, Son?

JOSH
Yeah!

MOM
Nah!  Nah!  I don't know about this one, Bob.  No, this looks too 
scary.

DAD
It's okay.

JOSH
Oh my gosh!

MOM
See, I told you he doesn't want to go on it.
DAD
Son, you know, you don't have to go on this thing if you don't feel 
like it.

JOSH
No!  No!  It's just that I...I want to go on it myself.

MOM
You do?

JOSH
Yeah.  I think it's something...yeah, I think it's something I should 
do.

DAD
Great!  Why don't we meet you at the ferris wheel.

JOSH
Half hour.

SCENE 7

CYNTHIA
Josh?

JOSH
Oh, hi!

CYNTHIA
Hi!  Have you been on this before?

JOSH
This?

CYNTHIA
Yeah.

JOSH
Yes.

CYNTHIA
Is it scary?

JOSH
Yes.

CYNTHIA
Are you here alone?

JOSH
Yes.

CYNTHIA
Look.  Aren't those your parents?

JOSH
Where?

MOM
Honey!

CYNTHIA
Right over there.

MOM
Smile!

JOSH
Why, yes.

DARIN
Hey, who's this?

CYNTHIA
This is Josh Baskin.

DARIN
How ya doin'?

CYNTHIA
This is Darin.  He drives.

MAN
Next!

DARIN
Go ahead.

MAN
Yo next!

DARIN
Go ahead!

MAN
Yo next!  Woah!  Read this sign.  You must be at least this big to ride 
this ride!

CYNTHIA
What?

MAN
Hey, I don't make the rules here.  Next!  Next!

CYNTHIA
Well, it's a stupid rule.

MAN
Look, why don't you try the kiddy ride?

SCENE 8

JOSH
Drop twenty-five cents here.  C'mon!  C'mon!  C'mon!  ...Neat!  ...Make 
my wish....I wish I were big....Your wish is granted.

SCENE 9

MOM
Josh!  Josh!  Josh!

JOSH

It's seven-thirty.  Are you up?  ...Come on Sleepy Head!  You're going 
to miss the bus and I can't drive you today! ...What does he do in his 
sleep?  ...Honey?  I put out some clean clothes.  Bring down your 
dungarees and stuff for the laundry, okay?

JOSH
Okay.

MOM
Are you getting a cold, Josh?

JOSH
No!  Fine!

MOM
He's got a cold.  Then Rachel's gonna get a cold and I'm gonna get a 
cold...

JOSH
Oh my God.

MOM
Breakfast is ready, Josh!

JOSH
Be right there!

MOM
Josh!  Hurry up!  Your eggs are getting cold!  ...Bring down Rachel 
with you, all right?

JOSH
Okay!

MOM
You want orange juice or...What about your breakfast?!

SCENE 10

MOM
Oh, you...don't!  Don't!

JOSH
I'm sorry! ...Mom, it's me.  It's Josh.  Mom, I'm a grown up!

MOM
Stop it!  Oh God!
JOSH
I made a wish last night...I turned into a grown up, Mom!  I made this 
wish on a machine...

MOM
Go away!  Go away!  Please!

JOSH
...and it turned me into a grown up!  It was last night at the 
carnival!  My birthday is November 3rd...I got a B on my history test!

MOM
Here's my purse!  You can have anything that's in it!  Go away!

JOSH
My, my, my baseball team is called the Dukes!  Uh, I made this for you!   
Who are you calling?  Ah!  I have a birthmark behind my left knee!

MOM
You bastard!  What did you do to my son?

JOSH
I am your son, Mom!

MOM
Where is my child?!  Where is my son?!  Police!

SCENE 11

COACH
Heads up!  Heads up out there!

BILLY
I'm open!  Here!  I'm open!

COACH
I want you to gather up these balls, go to the locker room and get on 
to your next class!  Wash shirts and shorts!  Billy.  Do us both a 
favor.  Put the balls in the equipment closet and you practice your lay 
up.

SCENE 12

JOSH
Billy.

BILLY
Yeah?  What?

JOSH
It's me.  It's Josh!

BILLY
Coach Burns!  Coach Burns!  Coach Burns!

JOSH
Wait a minute!  Shut up!  Shut up!  I'm your best friend, you've gotta 
believe me!  I'll prove it to you!  Billy, please!

BILLY
Help!  Help!

JOSH
God damn it Billy Kopecky!  Look, I know that I don't look like myself, 
okay!  But something really strange happened and I'm really scared and 
I need your help!  You're my best friend!  I can prove it to you!  
...Ooh!  The spades go, Down!  Down! Baby!  Down!  Down the roller 
coaster!  Sweet, sweet baby!  Sweet, sweet delectable!  Shimmy, shimmy 
cocoa pop!  Shimmy, shimmy rock!  Shimmy, shimmy cocoa pop!  Shimmy,

more times!

BILLY
Josh?  You look terrible.

JOSH
I know.
SCENE 13

POLICE
That's right.  We're at the scene right now.  Well, she's pretty upset 
and she's not making any sense at all.  There's no ransom note, no 
prints, there's no nothin.'  Tell you what, file a report and to be on 
the safe side...

KID#1
I bet he ran away.  Wish I could.

KID#2
Want me to pack your bags?

SCENE 14

BILLY
We go to the city, we lay low for a couple of days, find that Zoltar 
Machine, make your wish...you'll be home by Thursday!

JOSH
Well, I'm not supposed to go to New York without my folks!

BILLY
C'mon!  You'll be fine!  ...Here.

JOSH
Where did you get this?!

BILLY
From my Dad's top drawer!

JOSH
You stole it?!

BILLY
It's his emergency fund!

JOSH
Jesus Billy!

BILLY
Well what do you call this?!

SCENE 15

WOMAN
You lookin' for some fun tonight sweet thing?

JOSH
No, thank you.

MAN
Hey man, can you spare some change?

JOSH
No, not really.

BILLY
Hey, this looks okay.

JOSH
No it doesn't.

BILLY
Saint James, Josh, it's religious.

SCENE 16

BILLY
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

MAN
Burp!

JOSH
Uh, we would like a hotel room, please.

MAN
$17.50 a night for the room, $10.00 deposit for the sheets....You go 
straight to the top of the stairs.  It's the last door on the right.  
Next to the bathroom.  Wait a second, I'll show you.

SCENE 17

BILLY
It smells bad.

JOSH
Shh!

MAN
Have a pleasant stay....Hey Angel!  Get out of that bathroom now!

JOSH
I don't want to stay here by myself.

BILLY
I can't help it Josh.  I've gotta be home by ten.  Look, I'll cut 
classes tomorrow and we'll find that Zoltar thing before you know it, 
okay?  It's just one night.  All right?

JOSH
All right.

BILLY
Good.

JOSH
What if I can't sleep?

BILLY
It's probably better if you don't.  See you in the morning.

JOSH
Well, you mean like what time?

BILLY
8:30.  I'd use the chain if I were you.

JOSH
Mom...Mom....

SCENE 18

JOSH
I told you, it's not a video game.

BILLY
Well, what is it?

JOSH
Well, it's not a video game.

BILLY
This one's got a number on it.  Does yours?

JOSH
No.  Oh wait, here's one.

MAN
Hey, what are doing?  What are doing?

JOSH
Do you have Zoltar?

MAN
No.  I told you, I looked back in the back.  I've got Powerhouse, I've 
got ...

JOSH
We really need Zoltar.

MAN
Well, I haven't got it.

SCENE 19

BILLY
This is it.

JOSH
They aren't going to have it.

BILLY
They'll have it.

MAN
Can I help you?

JOSH
Yes.  We would like a list of all carnivals and fairs.

BILLY
And arcades.

JOSH
Yeah.

MAN
Carnivals and fairs...Try Consumer Affairs, down the hall, room 111.

JOSH
Thank you.

SCENE 20

WOMAN
Fill this out in triplicate.  $5.00 filing charge.

BILLY
See.

WOMAN
One month to process.  You get in six weeks.

JOSH
Six weeks?

WOMAN
Sometimes longer, but, you could get lucky....Next please!

SCENE 21

JOSH
I'm gonna be thirty years old for the rest of my life.

BILLY
Would you come on.  We'll figure something out.  By the way, you may be 
older than that!

JOSH
So now what?

BILLY
I'll come and see you everyday after school.

JOSH
How?

BILLY
I'll tell them I made the basketball team.

JOSH
I won't have anything to do.

BILLY
You can get a job.

JOSH
I can't get a job.

BILLY
Why?  It can't be any different than school.  What are you good at?

JOSH
I don't know.  Making spit balls?

SCENE 22

BILLY
How about a delivery man?

JOSH
I don't know how drive.
BILLY
Oh yeah, right...Cardiological technician, civil engineer...

JOSH
You gonna eat your cherry?

BILLY
Go ahead....Clerical transcriber...

JOSH
Billy?

BILLY
Yeah....Gross.  God, that's gross!

JOSH
Hey, go on to the next column.

BILLY
Collection agent, company clerk, computer operator, construction 
engineer...

JOSH
Computer operator?  Computer operator, read that one.

BILLY
Josh, would you quit with your stupid computers!

JOSH
Just read it!

BILLY
Macmillan Toys...toys!

JOSH
Toys!

SCENE 23

WOMAN
Macmillan Toys, may I help you?

BILLY
Okay, what's next?  There.

JOSH
Previous employment.

BILLY
Your paper route.

JOSH
I can't put that.

BILLY
Paper route circulation?

JOSH
Yeah!

BILLY
What's he got?  Hey, don't worry about it.

JOSH
Social Security number?

BILLY
32-17-25.

JOSH
What is that?

BILLY
My locker combination.

JOSH
Great!

WOMAN
Mr. Baskin.  Mr. Baskin?

JOSH
Yes.  Yes.

WOMAN
The Personnel Director will see you now....Uh, you son can wait out 
here.

JOSH
Yeah, okay.  Son, you should sit down and don't give the lady any 
trouble now.

BILLY
Sure Dad!  ...Don't forget--look him in the eye!

SCENE 24

MAN
Couple of numbers missing on your Social Security.

JOSH
Oh, uh twelve.

MAN
One two.  Says here you've got four years experience.

JOSH
Yes.

MAN
All on computers?

JOSH
Yes.

MAN
Where did you go to school?

JOSH
It was called George Washington.

MAN
Oh, G.W.  My brother-in-law got his doctorate there.  Did you pledge?

JOSH
Yes.  Every morning.

SUSAN
It happened again!  David, the girl is absolutely useless!  You've got 
to get me someone who knows what she is doing!  Excuse me.  I'm not 
getting any of my mail, nothing has been filed!  Ever since she got 
engaged, my life has been a disaster!  

MAN
You know, she came so highly recommended.

SUSAN
She spent the last three months writing down her married name.  Mrs. 
Judy Hicks.  Mrs. Donald Hicks.  Mrs. Judy Mitchleson Hicks.  Sometimes 
with a hyphen, sometimes without a hyphen.  Sometimes she spells the 
hyphen!

MAN
Well, I really don't know where I can put her.

SUSAN
Put her on unemployment!

MAN
When can you start?

JOSH
Soon.

SCENE 25

MAN
I thought we'd start you out with preschoolers.  Should take you a few 
days.  Give you a chance to find your way around.  Do you smoke?

JOSH
Well, uh, just once, but...

MAN
Only on breaks in the coffee room....Most of that is pretty straight 
forward stuff.  If you have any questions, come to me.  Good luck.

JOSH
Bye!

SCENE 26

SCOTT
Psst!  Psst!  Hey!  Hey!  I'm Scott Brennan.

JOSH
Uh, I'm Josh Baskin.

SCOTT
Listen, what are you trying to do?  Get us all fired?

JOSH
Huh?

SCOTT
You've gotta slow down.  Pace yourself.  Slowly!  Slowly!

JOSH
Sorry.  Today's my first day.

SCOTT
I know!

JOSH
So how long have you worked here?

SCOTT
Five years.  Work stinks but the fringe benefits are great!  See that 
girl over there in the red?  Say hi to her and she'll be yours.  She'll 
wrap her legs around you so tight you'll be begging for mercy!

JOSH
Well, I'll stay away from her then!

SCOTT
Excuse me.  Yeah Brennan.  I gave it to you yesterday!  Oh, here it is.  
I don't have time to xerox it.  Let the new guy do it.

SCENE 27

MR. M
That's total bullshit Paul!

PAUL
Look sir, the favorability rate is...

MR. M
Come on!  Let's not lie to ourselves!  If a kid likes a toy it sells.  
That's all!

SUSAN
But every bit of research and focus testing...

MR. M
It works with research, it works with focus testing, it just doesn't 
work with the kids!

JOSH
Sorry!  I'm sorry!

PAUL
Why don't you watch where the hell you're going!

SUSAN
Are you okay!

MR. M
I'm fine.

PAUL
You could kill somebody running around here like that!

MR. M
It's all right Paul.  The boss should get knocked on his ass once in a 
while.  It's good for him.

PAUL
I don't know sir, maybe you should see a doctor.

MR. M
For crying out loud Paul, I'm fine!  I'm fine!

PAUL
Sorry sir!  Sorry!
MR. M
Where were you going anyway, son?

JOSH
Uh, I was going to the xerox room because they needed these by 5:00.

MR. M
Oh, that's good!  Nothing wrong with a little hustle.  Nothing at all!  
Right Paul?

PAUL
What does he mean?  I hustle!  Uh sir!  Sir!

SCENE 28

MOM
Hello?  ...Hello?

JOSH
Hello.  Mrs. Baskin?

MOM
Yes.

JOSH
How are you?

MOM
Who is this?

JOSH
I just wanted you to know that Josh is all right.  He's okay.

MOM
You have my boy?

JOSH
Yeah.  And you're gonna get him back, just the way he was.

MOM
Look, I swear to God--If you do anything to him, if you touch one hair 
on his head, I will spend the rest of my life making sure you suffer!

JOSH
Wow!  Thanks!

MOM
Let me talk to Josh!

JOSH
Oh, he can't come to the phone right now.

MOM
Why not?  Why not?  What did you do to him?!

JOSH
I didn't do anything to him!  I think he's a terrific kid!

MOM
I want proof that he's all right!

JOSH
Uh, well, all right.  Ask me something that only he would know.  Then 
I'll ask him for you and that way you'll know that he's okay.

MOM
Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was a little boy.

JOSH
Isn't there something else that you would rather ask him?

MOM
Ask him!

JOSH
Oh, I got it!  I got it!  Memories, like the corner of my mind.  Misty 
water color memories, of the way we were.  Scattered pictures...Look, 
you're gonna see him again really soon.  I promise.  I cross my heart.  
We'll talk about this later.

SCENE 29

MAN
Harris!  Brennan!  Baskin!
JOSH
What is this?

SCOTT
Pay day.

JOSH
$187.00?!  Ha!  Ha!

SCOTT
Yeah.  They really screw you, don't they?

SCENE 30

JOSH
Hi.

WOMAN
Hi.  Okay, so how would you like that?

JOSH
Three dimes, a hundred dollar bill, and eighty seven ones.

WOMAN
One, two, three...

SCENE 31

JOSH
I'm never eating again.

BILLY
It wasn't that bad.

JOSH
It was the boat ride that did it.

BILLY
No, it was the pork rinds.

JOSH
Pork rinds!  Aghh!  We sure had fun, didn't we?

BILLY
Yeah, we sure did.

SCENE 32

BOY
Got you!

JOSH
What's your name?

BOY
Jordan, what's yours?

JOSH
Mine's Josh.

BOY
I'm gonna blow you away Josh!

JOSH
But I just got you!

BOY
No way!  Get back here!

SCENE 33

MR. M
You work for me, don't you?

JOSH
Yes.

MR. M
I thought so.  What, are you here with your kids?

JOSH
No.  I was just looking around.

MR. M
Oh.  Me too.  I come here every Saturday.  Can't see this on a 
marketing report.

JOSH
What's a marketing report?

MR. M
Exactly.  Come on.  What do you think of that?

JOSH
The Championship Hockey?  Oh, I love it.  Only the...

MR. M
Only what?

JOSH
Well, the pieces don't move.

MR. M
What do you mean?

JOSH
Well, on the old set you could slide the men up and down the ice, and 
now all they do is spin around.  It was more like real hockey the old 
way.  Why did they change it?

MR. M
I don't know.

JOSH
You see, the Star Fighters are good because you can change all the 
pieces.  But I never liked the Galactakons.  You only get one robot, 
and they don't come with a vehicle.  

MR. M
I see.

JOSH
Plus you can't take them underwater.  And if you do they...Neat!

MR. M
Okay, let's check out the...Piano lessons?

JOSH
Three years.

MR. M
Me too.  Everyday, after school....Chopsticks....What department did 
you say you were in?

JOSH
Oh, I'm in computers.

MR. M
Computers?  You just saved me a trip to the gym Son.

SCENE 34

SUSAN
Vice President in charge of Product Development.

PAUL
Vice President!  He's only been here a week!  Vice President?!

SUSAN
And he came from data processing!

PAUL
He's out of his mind!  The old man has finally lost it!

SUSAN
Did you know they gave him Bob's old office?

PAUL
Bob's office?!  Bob's office is bigger than my office!  There's got to 
be a reason.  Things like this don't happen unless there's a reason.

SCENE 35

BILLY
That means if the president dies you get to take over?

JOSH
No. No.  They got a hundred of them.  Are we ready?

WOMAN
Yes Mr. Baskin.

JOSH
Come on in.

BILLY
Look at this place!  It's bigger than the principal's office!

JOSH
How would you know?

BILLY
Remember that explosion in science?

JOSH
Oh yes!

BILLY
Truck-a-Killer!  $59.95?

JOSH
You know that only costs 10 bucks to make.

BILLY
Get out of here! ...What is this?

JOSH
Oh, well, this is just...They just put this in here...it doesn't mean 
anything.

BILLY
So what do they make you do for all this?

JOSH
Well, I play with all of this stuff and then, I go in there and tell 
them what I think.

BILLY
That's it?

JOSH
Yeah.

BILLY
And they pay you for that?

JOSH
Yeah.

BILLY
Suckers!

JOSH
Oh, thank you Miss Patterson.  Hey!  Miss Patterson.  Could you call 
down to Media and have them send up a video tape of the Giants Broncos 
Super Bowl?  And have them edit out all the commercials and talkin' and 
stuff?

WOMAN
Yes Mr. Baskin.

JOSH
Miss Patterson.

BILLY
You're the luckiest guy I know.

SCENE 36

PAUL
Did you check Mattel?

SUSAN
Nothing.

PAUL
Colleco?

SUSAN
Zero.

PAUL
He can't come from nowhere Susan.  He has to come from somewhere.  How 
about Hasbro?

SUSAN
Yes.  And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder.  I have called everywhere.  
Nobody's ever heard of him!

PAUL
Great!

SUSAN
Face it Paul.  The guy comes from data processing.

PAUL
Terrific.  That is just terrific!  This is just terrific!

SUSAN
You're being paranoid Paul.

SCENE 37

PAUL
These tests were conducted over a six month period using a double-blind 
format of eight over-lapping demographic groups.  Every region of the 
country was sampled, the focus testing showed a solid base in the 9 to 
11-year old bracket--with a possible carry-over into the 12-year olds.  
When you consider that Nobots and Transformers pull over 37 percent 
market share, and that we are targeting the same area, I think that we 
should see one quarter of that and that is one fifth of the total 
revenue from all of last year.  Any questions?  Yes?  Yes?

JOSH
I don't get it.

PAUL
What exactly don't you get?

JOSH
It turns from a building into a robot, right?

PAUL
Precisely.

JOSH
Well, what's fun about that?

PAUL
Well, if you had read your industry breakdown, you would see that our 
success in the action figure area has climbed from 27 percent to 45 
percent in the last two years.  There, that might help.

JOSH
Oh.

PAUL
Yes?

JOSH
I still don't get it.

PAUL
What?!

MR. M
What don't you get Josh?

JOSH
Well, there's a million robots that turn into something.  And this is a 
building that turns into a robot.  So what's so fun about playing with 
a building?  That's not any fun!

PAUL
This is a skyscraper.

JOSH
Well, couldn't it be like a robot that turns into something like a bug 
or something?

PAUL
A bug?
JOSH
Yeah!  Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe like giant claws that 
could pick up a car and crush it like that!

MAN
A prehistoric transformer?

MR. M
Interesting.

PAUL
Gentlemen!

MAN
So the robot turns into a bug.

PAUL
Ah, gentlemen, listen...

MAN
Listen to him.  He's got a very good idea here.  The robot turns into a 
bug.

MAN
This is a great idea!

JOSH
Different sizes and things.  And...you could have them wreck 
something...

MAN
A lady bug.  Transformers for girls!

MR. M
This is a bug that moves....It's got all kinds of possibilities.

PAUL
This doesn't just happen.  This doesn't happen.  You don't just come to 
a meeting and say "bugs."

SUSAN
I, uh....

MR. M
Well done, Josh.  Well done.

SCENE 38

PAUL
Ho! Ho! Ho!  He is vicious!  

SUSAN
He's not vicious.

PAUL
Oh, come on Susan, don't kid yourself.  That man is a killer!

SUSAN
All he said was "I don't get it."

PAUL
I don't get it!  I don't get!  I don't get!  He's going for the throat, 
trying to eviscerate me!  Did you see the look on Macmillan's face?!

SUSAN
Mmm Hmm.

SCENE 39

REALTOR
It's quite a unique space.  The lines are so clean and you don't get 
any of that partition quality.  It has 50-foot ceilings, all hardwood 
floors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a brand new bathroom with 
a jet stream jacuzzi.

BILLY
We'll take it.

SCENE 40

MAN
Baskin.  Rental delivery!

JOSH
Dear Mom and Dad.  They said that I could write you and let you know I 
was okay.  So far, they're treating me fine.  I've got enough to eat 
and I'm perfectly safe.  They say that I'll get out of here in about a 
month.  In the mean time, it's a lot like camp!  I watch TV and even 
get outside once in a while.  I know you miss me.  But try not to 
worry.  I think this experience might even be good for me.  I love you 
very much and I know that I'll see you soon.  Your son, Joshua.  P.S.  
Give Rachel a kiss from her big brother.

SCENE 41

WOMAN
It's very beautiful and I'm having a lovely time.

MR. M
I'm glad Miss Patterson.

WOMAN
It's much better than last year.  I just wanted to tell you that.

MR. M
I'll have another scotch....Susan.

SUSAN
Love your tux.

MR. M
I think it's the same as the maitre's.

SUSAN
Have you decided what you're doing on the Danberry line?

MR. M
No, I haven't.

SUSAN
Well, uh, I think if you got everyone's input up front, I mean right 
from the beginning....

MR. M
Susan, have a drink.

SUSAN
What?

MR. M
Have a couple drinks.  It's a party.

SCENE 42

MR. M
Josh!  Glad you could make it.

MAN
Bet he gets another raise.

MR. M
Now that's what I call a tuxedo.

JOSH
I rented it.  This is a real bow tie though.  I tied it myself.  And 
that's why I was late.

MR. M
No, you're not late at all.  Come on, let me show you around.

JOSH
Hey, there's Miss Patterson!  Hi!  There's the guy from the meeting!  
Hi!

SCENE 43

PAUL
The guy's a damn knock-off artist.

MAN
What do you mean?

PAUL
The Amphibian?  He takes 10,000 G. I. Joes, slaps some gills on them, 
webs their feet, and packages them in seaweed....So I show him the 
schedule and he says, "It's not correct accounting procedure!"  Give me 
a goddamn break!

MAN
But the toy sold Paul.

SUSAN
Excuse me.

SCENE 44

SUSAN
Hi.

JOSH
Hi.

SUSAN
All the same people having all the same discussion.  It's like they 
cloned some party in 1983 and kept spinning it out again and again and 
again.  I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll line.  

JOSH
Thanks.

SUSAN
They were so, incisive.  It's Beluga.  Macmillan orders it every 
year....You all right?  You okay?  You want a glass of water?  You want 
something to drink?

JOSH
Could I have a milkshake or something?

SUSAN
I've got a car outside.  You want to get out of here?

JOSH
Uh Huh.

SUSAN
Let's go.

SCENE 45

SUSAN
I'm not really a big one for parties.  You know, I like things that are 
a little more intimate.  

JOSH
Wow!  Is this your car?

SUSAN
Well, it's the company's car.

JOSH
Oh, this is the coolest thing I've ever seen!

SUSAN
I mean, just seeing someone in the office, you don't really get a 
chance to know them.  I mean, just being with you here tonight, I 
really get a sense of who you are.

JOSH
Are you gonna eat these fries?

SUSAN
No. No....

JOSH
Hey mister?  You want some of these fries?  We're not going to eat 
them.

DRIVER
No, thank you.

SUSAN
You see, it's hard in a business situation...I mean there's this 
invisible line and even you're attracted to someone...What, are you 
going to call someone before...?

JOSH
No.

SUSAN
Uh, I mean at this point in my life I...Don't...Don't play with the 
radio...Leave the uh...Don't...I'm really vulnerable right now!  You 
know...I mean, I love my job and I....

JOSH
Ejector seat!  This is great!  Hey!  Come on up!  Hey, that was my 
apartment.

SUSAN
Really?  I'd love to see where you live.

SCENE 46

SUSAN
So have you always lived alone?

JOSH
No, not always.

SUSAN
Ah.  Is it just recently or...?

JOSH
Yeah.

SUSAN
Give yourself a couple of days, it'll pass.

JOSH
Well, they said it was gonna take six weeks.

SUSAN
Well, it can be painful but, that's what they invented Xanax for, 
right?

JOSH
Watch your step.

SUSAN
I'm not sure we should do this yet.

JOSH
Do what?

SUSAN
Well, I mean I like you and I want to spend the night with you....

JOSH
Do you mean sleep over?

SUSAN
Well,...yeah!

JOSH
Okay!  But I get to be on top!

SCENE 47

SUSAN
You live here?

JOSH
Yeah.  It's nice, isn't it?

SUSAN
Yeah.

JOSH
You uh, want a soda?

SUSAN
Huh?

JOSH
Soda?  You want one?

SUSAN
Yeah, sure.

JOSH
They rigged this up so you don't need any quarters....Don't!  Don't...!

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
The glue's not dry.  Sorry.

SUSAN
Sorry.

JOSH
It's okay....You wanna play pinball?

SUSAN
No.

JOSH
You don't need quarters for this either.  It's free.

SUSAN
No, thank you.

JOSH
Okay.

SUSAN
Is that a trampoline?

JOSH
Yeah.  You wanna try it?

SUSAN
No.

JOSH
You should.  It's really fun.  It's simple, too.  Come on!  Come on!  
You'll like it and it's really easy to do.

SUSAN
No, I don't think...

JOSH
I'm serious...

SUSAN
Do have some wine?

JOSH
Take off your shoes...It's really easy....Let me get rid of these 
balls.

SUSAN
No, I'm...I'm...I'll watch.

JOSH
Come on.  It's fun.  I'll do it with you.  Up you go.  Excellent.

SUSAN
Help me up?

JOSH
Sure.

SUSAN
Okay.

JOSH
Okay.  Jump.  

SUSAN
You want me to jump?

JOSH
Yes.

SUSAN
There.  Now can we have a drink?

JOSH
No!  No!  No!  I mean really jump.  Now get some air between you and 
the trampoline.

SUSAN
There.

JOSH
Oh, come on!  I'll do it with you!  All right?  I'll show you how to do 
it.  You ready?  Come on.  Jump.  See?  There it is.  That's all there 
is to it.  There you go.  There you go.  Yeah!  It's easy!  Anybody 
could do this!

SCENE 48

JOSH
Here.  Pick one....It's for you.  It's a glow in the dark compass 
ring...so you won't get lost....Goodnight.

SCENE 49

PAUL
Did you have fun last night?

SUSAN
Sure.  Yeah.

PAUL
Yeah...You left pretty quick.

SUSAN
I gave him a ride home Paul.

PAUL
Oh, did he enjoy it?

SUSAN
Don't be ridiculous.

PAUL
Ah, that's me, Mr. Ridiculous.  Just a silly old guy.

SUSAN
I don't feel like going out tonight.

PAUL
What do you mean?  They're your friends....Come on!  Leave it!  Leave 
it!  Would you quit it!  Do you have to play with everything?

SCENE 50

PAUL
Baskin?  Baskin!

JOSH
Wouldn't you rather play basketball?  I know how to play that.  We 
could be like a team for the Macmillan Company.

PAUL
No.

JOSH
I'm not very good at sports, but I'll give it a try.  My best sport is 
video hockey.

PAUL
That isn't a sport.

JOSH
Well, it takes eye to hand coordination.

PAUL
It's not a sport if you don't sweat!

JOSH
What about golf?  You don't sweat and that's a sport.

PAUL
Yeah, and you're not sittin' there letting some machine do all the 
work!

JOSH
What about car racing?

PAUL
Aw shut up Baskin!

JOSH
What are the rules again?

PAUL
I told you.  Over the line to serve.  Yellow is out of bounds.  Play to 
21--ready?

JOSH
Sorry.  Sorry.

PAUL
One nothing.  Come on!  Get it!  Get it!  Get it!

JOSH
Okay.

PAUL
Thatta boy!  Okay, you ready?  All right....Ho ho!  Nice try!  That was 
in!  Two zip.  Just made it.  Two zip.  Ready?  Okay!  Here we 
go!...19/18.

JOSH
Uh, that was under the line.

PAUL
What?

JOSH
That was under the line.  You said it had to be over the line on a 
serve.

PAUL
No I didn't.

JOSH
Yeah you did!  You said it had to be over the line on a serve!

PAUL
No I did not, now give me the goddamn ball!

JOSH
Well that's cheating!

PAUL
Give me the goddamn ball, will ya!

JOSH
No!

PAUL
Give me the ball you little shit!  

JOSH
It's my serve.

PAUL
Give me the ball!  Give me the goddamn ball!  I never said that!

JOSH
Yes you did.

PAUL
Give me the...Give me the ball!  Give me the ball!

JOSH
Cheater!  You cheat!

PAUL
I did not cheat!

JOSH
You cheat!  You cheat!

PAUL
Give me the ball!  Give me the ball!  Give me it!  Give me the ball!

SCENE 51

JOSH
He didn't have to punch me.

SUSAN
I know.  He's scared of you.  You don't play his game.

JOSH
I tried to play his game.  He beat me up.  If he's scared of me then 
why did he punch me?

SUSAN
He punched you because he's scared of you.

JOSH
I don't get it.

SUSAN
It's just the way he is.  Everything is a fight with him.  Everyone's 
an enemy.  It's not just a job for him, it's a war.  

JOSH
Well how come you're so nice?

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
Well, you work just as hard as he does and you're not like that.

SUSAN
You don't...you don't know me that well.

JOSH
Yes I do.  You're one of the nicest people I've met.

SUSAN
How do you do it?

SCENE 52

PAUL
What's this?

SUSAN
What does it look like?!  Shampoo, razor, toothpaste, two neckties and 
your exercise tape!  Oh, and I want my keys back!

PAUL
Sure.  It's just some scratches.  He'll get over it.

SUSAN
Oh, it has nothing to do with him.

PAUL
Oh come on Susan!  He's just another link in the chain!  First it was 
Tom Caulfield, then Handlen.  Then Golding, then me!  Am I missing 
somebody?

SUSAN
It's not like that anymore!

PAUL
What is so special about Baskin?

SUSAN
He's a grown up!

PAUL
Susan.

SUSAN
I can't believe you brought up Golding.

SCENE 53

BILLY
And many more!  What are you going to wish for this time?

SCENE 54

BILLY
I know what we can do!  We can go out and get some beers, some dirty 
magazines and go back...

JOSH
Uh, I can't Billy.

BILLY
What you mean you can't?  Of course you can!  It's your birthday!

JOSH
No, I can't...I have to go somewhere.

BILLY
Where?

JOSH
Um...well, I have to go meet somebody and...

BILLY
So, you got all night!

JOSH
Yeah I know, but it's just...well I can't right now okay, but I'll call 
you, all right?  Okay?  I'll give you a call.  Thanks again Billy, it 
was fun!

SCENE 55

SUSAN
Hi....Do you want to come in?

JOSH
Sure.

SUSAN
Sit down....Want to go?

JOSH
Yeah!  Yeah!

SCENE 56

JOSH
Want to go again?!

SCENE 57

JOSH
So they have these cars that you can actually drive them except they're 
on this rail so you can't get off the road...You have a really big gob 
of mustard right, right...

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
Mustard right....

SUSAN
Where?

JOSH
Right there.

SUSAN
Is it gone?

JOSH
Well,....

SUSAN
Is that...gone?

JOSH
Yeah.

SUSAN
Listen.

JOSH
What?  Music?

SUSAN
Wanna dance?

JOSH
Dance?

SUSAN
Well we don't have to if you don't want to.

JOSH
Okay.  Okay.

SUSAN
All right.
JOSH
Okay....Are you cold?

SUSAN
Mm Mm.

JOSH
We could get some hot chocolate....You can wear my jacket if you want.

SCENE 58

SUSAN
Oh, I haven't done this in a long time....What were you like when you 
were younger?

JOSH
Oh, I wasn't much different.

SUSAN
I believe that about you....I've been thinking about you a lot....It's 
crazy....In my car, lying in bed....I've just never gone out with 
someone like you....With all the other men there was so much to 
hide....I feel like I can tell you anything.

JOSH
Susan?  There's something I think I should tell you.

SUSAN
What?

SCENE 59

SUSAN
You want the light on?

SCENE 60

JOSH
Hey Frank, how are you?  Good morning everybody!

WOMAN
Good morning Sir.

JOSH
I'd like some coffee please Miss Patterson.

WOMAN
But you don't drink coffee.

JOSH
And uh, make it black.

SCENE 61

WOMAN
You know, you two should come to Vermont.  It is so pretty up there.

MAN
Did anyone happen to see that great documentary about Columbus on PBS 
the other night?  

WOMAN
Uh, no.  Was it good?

MAN
I had no idea he had a fourth ship.

JOSH
Yeah, the Santa Christina.

MAN
That's right.

JOSH
He only had that on his second trip, though.

MAN
You saw it, too.

JOSH
No, but I used to study...stuff.

MAN
Really?

BOY
Dad, I need some help.

MAN
All right, but not now Adam.

BOY
Yeah, but Dad you said...

MAN
Adam we have guests.

WOMAN
He's had the roughest time with algebra.  We've tried tutors, 
everything.

JOSH
Algebra?  I used to study that, too.

SCENE 62

JOSH
All right, let's say Larry Bird is going to score 10 points in the 
first quarter.

BOY
Okay?

JOSH
How many is he going to score in the whole game?

BOY
That's easy, that's 40 points.

JOSH
Probably.  Okay.  And that's algebra.

BOY
Right!  It is?

JOSH
Yeah!  See.  Okay.  One quarter is to ten points that he scores in that 
quarter.  Just as four....

WOMAN
You're right.  He's wonderful!

SUSAN
I know.

SCENE 63

BILLY
Department of Consumer Affairs?  Yeah Buddy it came!

SCENE 64

MAN
He's never done this before.

MAN
Kind of like a sweepstakes.

PAUL
Get the Art Department on the phone.  Get them!

SUSAN
Send out for some sandwiches.

MR. M
Maybe next year, all right?  Next year.

SCENE 65

SUSAN
You can do it.  I know you can!

JOSH
I cannot plan a whole line!

SUSAN
Why?  Nobody knows more about toys in the entire company!
JOSH
Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy and stuff like that!

SUSAN
All he wants is a proposal!

JOSH
I can't!

SUSAN
Look, you come up with the ideas and I'll handle the marketing.

JOSH
But it's....

SUSAN
Come on.  It'll be neat.

JOSH
All right...I don't know...I don't have any new ideas for toys or 
anything.

SUSAN
You've got great ideas!

SCENE 66

BILLY
Yeah, well tell him I called again.  Kopecky!  K-O-P...Yeah 
right...well tell him it's important!

SCENE 67

JOSH
You see it won't be like these where you just follow the story along.  
You would actually make a whole different story appear just by pressing 
these buttons.

SUSAN
An electronic comic book?  That's amazing!

JOSH
Yeah.  An electric comic book.  It's gonna be different every time.

SUSAN
This is incredible.  You're brilliant--you know that?

JOSH
If you like one you could see it, you know, over and over and over 
again.

SUSAN
You're wonderful.

JOSH
You really like it?...You think Mac will like it?  You know, what we 
could do...We could do like sports comics...or like if you're going to 
steal second or something like that...You'd have sports 
books...baseball, football...really, it work with almost any sport 
there is.  Hockey!

SUSAN
What...What is it we're doing?  ...What's going on here?  

JOSH
You know, we're....Is something wrong?  You don't like it?

SUSAN
No!  No!  It's...I mean if it's an affair, that's one thing.  But if 
it's something else...I mean, not that we have to know right now, we 
don't...but if we think that it could turn into something 
else...well....How do you feel about all of this?

JOSH
How do I feel about what?

SUSAN
How do you feel about me?

JOSH
What is that supposed to mean?

SCENE 68

JOSH
Well, Wednesday would be better than Thursday...

WOMAN
Mr. Baskin can't be disturbed!

JOSH
Yeah, I have the Keating example right here...

BILLY
Where've you been?  I've been trying to reach you forever!

JOSH
Shh!  I'm right in the middle of something okay?

BILLY
That's the list.  All you've got to do is call!

JOSH
Can you give me just a minute, please?

BILLY
What are you talking about?  This is the list!

JOSH
Would you come back at lunch?  All right, I'm a little bit busy right 
now...Hello?

BILLY
Busy?!

JOSH
Billy!

BILLY
Are you out of your mind?!  

JOSH
Jesus, Billy!  Miss Patterson, could you get them on the phone 
again....

BILLY
This is the list we've been waiting for!

JOSH
I've got work to do!  Can't you understand that?  I've got a deadline 
to meet.  God!

BILLY
Who the fuck do you think you are?!

JOSH
Hey!

BILLY
Hey, you're Josh Baskin!  Remember?  You broke your arm on my roof!  
You hid in my basement when Robert Diceman was about to rip your head 
off!

JOSH
You don't get it, do you?  This is important!

BILLY
I'm your best friend.  What's more important than that, huh?  I'm three 
months older than you are--asshole!

SCENE 69

JOSH
You are standing in the cavern of the evil wizard.  All around you are 
the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs....Melt wizard....What do you want to 
melt him with?  ...Throw thermal pod.

SUSAN
Josh, what's wrong?  What is it?

JOSH
I haven't told you something because if I did, I didn't think you'd 
believe me.  And even if you did believe me, I didn't think you were 
going to like me anymore, so....

SUSAN
Oh, Honey, come here.  You can tell me anything.  What?

JOSH
Susan, I'm not what you think I am.
SUSAN
What do you mean?

JOSH
Before I met you I was in little league.  I was in little league and I 
rode my bike to school and I played with my friends and hung out with 
them and....

SUSAN
Josh.  Josh.  What are you talking about?

JOSH
I want to go home.  I miss my family Susan and I want to go home.

SUSAN
Oh my God!  You're married!

JOSH
No!  No!

SUSAN
I knew that this was too good to be true!  I knew that there had to be 
something!

JOSH
No.  No.  Susan, I'm not married.

SUSAN
You're not?

JOSH
No.  I'm a child!

SUSAN
What?

JOSH
I'm a child Susan, and I'm not ready for all this.

SUSAN
Oh that's fine.  That is just great!

JOSH
Well, you see what happened....

SUSAN
No.  I understand.  I'm not ready to make a commitment!

JOSH
No!  No!  No!

SUSAN
I'm not ready to accept responsibility!

JOSH
No!  You don't understand!  I mean, I'm thirteen years old!

SUSAN
Oh!  And who isn't?  You think that there isn't a frightened kid inside 
of me, too!

JOSH
No!  I mean I really am thirteen!  I went to bed one night and I was a 
kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a grown up.

SUSAN
Oh right!  And just yesterday I was a school girl with pigtails!  Why 
are you doing this Josh?

JOSH
There was this carnival in New Jersey.  I made a wish on this machine.  
It was called a Zoltar Machine...

SUSAN
Oh stop it!

JOSH
It was called a Zoltar Machine!  It had this bobbing head that looked 
just like a devil and if you got a quarter in the devil's mouth you 
could make a wish and I did!  So I made a wish to be big!  That is what 
I'm trying to tell you!  I changed into a grown up but I'm really just 
a kid!

SUSAN
Fine Josh!  You're a kid!  Look, I really don't know what it is that 
you're trying to tell me.  But we have a very big presentation to give 
tomorrow, so I'm going to get some sleep.

SCENE 70

BILLY
Josh?  Josh!  Oh, hi Mrs. Baskin.

MOM
Hi.  I was just looking around and...Your hair is getting longer.

BILLY
I got it cut yesterday.

MOM
He had a birthday.

BILLY
Yeah, I know.  He'll be coming back real soon.  Everything is going to 
be okay.

MOM
Thanks.

BILLY
Goodnight.

SCENE 71

BILLY
Right there.  Sea Point Park, New York!  Well?

JOSH
Yes?

WOMAN
They're waiting for you Mr. Baskin.

JOSH
Thanks.

BILLY
See you around.

SCENE 72

JOSH
There's this flat screen inside with pictures on it and you read it.  
And when you get down to the bottom you have to make a choice of what 
the character's going to do...Like if he going to go in and fight the 
dragon then you have to push one of the buttons.

PAUL
Excuse me.

JOSH
Paul.

PAUL
I don't get it.

JOSH
Well, it's a comic book that....

SUSAN
See, there's a computer chip inside which stores the choices, so when 
you reach the end of the page, you decide where the story goes.  That's 
the point.

MR. M
Terrific Susan.

SUSAN
A kid makes his own decision.

MR. M
This is really possible?

SUSAN
Yeah.  In fact, it's a very simple program.  Isn't that right?
MAN
So what happens when you run out of choices?

SUSAN
Well, that's the great thing.  You can just sell different adventures.  
Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole new set of options.

MAN
We could market this on a comic book rack.

JOSH
I'll be right back.

SCENE 73

MR. M
How much would the unit cost?

SUSAN
Well, our initial figure is around...around $7.00, with a retail cost 
of around $18.95.

PAUL
You expect a kid to pay $19.00 for a comic book?

SUSAN
I think a kid....Would you excuse me?

SCENE 74

SUSAN
Josh!  Josh!

SCENE 75

JOSH
Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New York?

BILLY
Sea Point Park?  Josh!....Josh!  Josh!...Yes!

SCENE 76

SUSAN
Excuse me.  You know him?  You know Josh?

BILLY
Yeah.

SUSAN
Look, you have to tell me where he went.

BILLY
Who are you?

SUSAN
I'm his girlfriend.

BILLY
Billy Kopecky.

SUSAN
Look, you have to tell me where he went.  Where did he go?  Please, 
tell me.  Tell me!

SCENE 77

JOSH
Work!  Damn it!....I wish I was a kid.

SUSAN
Josh!

JOSH
Susan!

SUSAN
You know, you don't walk out on somebody!  You don't just get up and 
leave and walk out like that!  You don't do that!

JOSH
I know.  I know.  I'm really sorry.  I'm really sorry but I didn't know 
what to do.  I didn't know what to say.

SUSAN
Oh God.  You got your wish.

JOSH
I tried to tell you.

SUSAN
I didn't listen, I guess.  I didn't hear you...

JOSH
I tried to tell you last night.

SUSAN
...or want to...or how would I have...or even if I did listen, why 
would I know?  Why would I know that?!

JOSH
I've been thinking about this and there are a million reasons for me to 
go home but there is only one reason for me to stay.

SUSAN
What?  What reason is that?

JOSH
Well, you...Oh, come on.  Don't cry.

SUSAN
So, what are you?  15?  16?

JOSH
I'm 13.

SUSAN
Well, that explains it.

JOSH
Maybe you could come with me.

SUSAN
No.  No.

JOSH
Why not?

SUSAN
I've been there before.  It's hard enough the first time.  You know 
what I mean?  You don't know what I mean....Come on, I'll drive you 
home.

JOSH
I'm sorry.

SUSAN
No, I'll be okay.  You'll be fine.  In ten years, who knows?  Maybe you 
should hold on to my number.

SCENE 78

SUSAN
So this is where you live.  Which one is it?

JOSH
The one right there.

SUSAN
Oh.  It's nice.  I'm gonna miss you.

JOSH
I'm gonna miss you, too.

SUSAN
You won't even remember me.

JOSH
Oh yes I will.

SCENE 79

JOSH
Mom?  Hello!
MOM
Josh?  Josh!  Josh!  Oh my God!  Oh, thank God you're home!

JOSH
Oh Ma, I missed you all so much!

SCENE 80

JOSH
I'm just not good enough.

BILLY
What are you talking about?  You've been hitting the ball over the 
fence almost every time in stick ball.  You just got to get used to a 
fatter bat.

JOSH
You really think I could do it?

BILLY
Yeah!

JOSH
Come on.  We'll hit some after supper.

BILLY
Okay.  I'll call you.

                                  Final Production Draft

                

               This is a Southern story, full of lies and fabrications, but 
               truer for their inclusion. 

               FADE IN:

               A RIVER.

               We're underwater, watching a fat catfish swim along.

               This is The Beast.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There are some fish that cannot be 
                         caught. It's not that they're faster 
                         or stronger than other fish. They're 
                         just touched by something extra. 
                         Call it luck. Call it grace. One 
                         such fish was The Beast.

               The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited 
               with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past 
               a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         By the time I was born, he was already 
                         a legend. He'd taken more hundred-
                         dollar lures than any fish in Alabama. 
                         Some said that fish was the ghost of 
                         Henry Walls, a thief who'd drowned 
                         in that river 60 years before. Others 
                         claimed he was a lesser dinosaur, 
                         left over from the Cretaceous period.

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT (1973)

               WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD 
               BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, 
               Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with 
               absolute conviction.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't put any stock into such 
                         speculation or superstition. All I 
                         knew was I'd been trying to catch 
                         that fish since I was a boy no bigger 
                         than you.
                              (closer)
                         And on the day you were born, that 
                         was the day I finally caught him.

               EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT (1977)

               A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES 
               as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I'd tried everything on it: 
                         worms, lures, peanut butter, peanut 
                         butter-and-cheese. But on that day I 
                         had a revelation: if that fish was 
                         the ghost of a thief, the usual bait 
                         wasn't going to work. I would have 
                         to use something he truly desired.

               Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight.

                                     LITTLE BRAVE
                              (confused)
                         Your finger?

               Edward slips his ring off.

                                     EDWARD
                         Gold.

               While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks 
               bored. He's heard this story before.

                                     EDWARD
                         I tied my ring to the strongest line 
                         they made -- strong enough to hold 
                         up a bridge, they said, if just for 
                         a few minutes -- and I cast upriver.

               INT. BLOOM FRONT HALL - NIGHT (1987)

               Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming 
               dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of 
               Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing.

                                     EDWARD (CONT'D)
                         The Beast jumped up and grabbed it 
                         before the ring even hit the water. 
                         And just as fast, he snapped clean 
                         through that line.

               WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His 
               mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and 
               practicality -- stands with him at the door.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can see my predicament. My wedding 
                         ring, the symbol of fidelity to my 
                         wife, soon to be the mother of my 
                         child, was now lost in the gut of an 
                         uncatchable fish.

               ON WILL AND SANDRA

                                     WILL
                              (low but insistent)
                         Make him stop.

               His mother pats him sympathetically, then adjusts his tie.

                                     WILL'S DATE
                         What did you do?

                                     EDWARD
                         I followed that fish up-river and 
                         down-river for three days and three 
                         nights, until I finally had him boxed 
                         in.

               Will regards his father with exasperated contempt.

                                     EDWARD
                         With these two hands, I reached in 
                         and snatched that fish out of the 
                         river. I looked him straight in the 
                         eye. And I made a remarkable 
                         discovery.

               INT. TINY PARIS RESTAURANT (LA RUE 14°) - NIGHT (1998)

               WILL, now 28, sits with his gorgeous bride JOSEPHINE. This 
               is their wedding reception, crowded with their friends and 
               family. They should be joyful, but Will is furious.

               Edward has the floor, ostensibly for a toast. The room is 
               cozy and drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         This fish, the Beast. The whole time 
                         we were calling it a him, when in 
                         fact it was a her. It was fat with 
                         eggs, and was going to lay them any 
                         day.

               Over near the doorway, we spot Sandra, just returned from 
               the restrooms. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier 
               if this were her own wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, I was in a situation. I could 
                         gut that fish and get my ring back, 
                         but doing so I would be killing the 
                         smartest catfish in the Ashton River, 
                         soon to be mother of a hundred others.

               Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, 
               but he gets up and leaves. Edward doesn't even notice.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I want to deprive my soon-to-be-
                         born son the chance to catch a fish 
                         like this of his own? This lady fish 
                         and I, well, we had the same destiny.

               As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father --

                                     EDWARD AND WILL
                         We were part of the same equation.

               Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Honey, it's still your night.

               Will can't articulate his anger. He just leaves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now, you may well ask, since this 
                         lady fish wasn't the ghost of a thief, 
                         why did it strike so quick on gold 
                         when nothing else would attract it?
                              (closer; he holds up 
                              his ring)
                         That was the lesson I learned that 
                         day, the day my son was born.

               He focuses his words on Sandra. This story is -- and has 
               always been -- about her more than anyone.

                                     EDWARD
                         Sometimes, the only way to catch an 
                         uncatchable woman is to offer her a 
                         wedding ring.

               A LAUGH from the crowd.

               Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she 
               crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not 
               lessened their affection for each other.

               As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way.

               The crowd APPLAUDS.

               Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for 
               her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer.

               Edward downs his champagne in a gulp.

               EXT. OUTSIDE LA RUE 14° - NIGHT

               We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. 
               Occasional PASSERSBY take notice, especially as it gets more 
               heated. Both men are a little drunk.

                                     EDWARD
                         What, a father's not allowed to talk 
                         about his son?

                                     WILL
                              (disbelieving)
                         I am a footnote in that story. I am 
                         the context for your great adventure. 
                         Which never happened! Incidentally! 
                         You were selling novelty products in 
                         Wichita the day I was born.

                                     EDWARD
                              (shaking his head)
                         Jesus Christ.

                                     WILL
                         Friend of yours? Did you help him 
                         out of a bind?

                                     EDWARD
                         Come on, Will. Everyone likes that 
                         story.

                                     WILL
                         No Dad, they don't. I do not like 
                         the story. Not anymore, not after a 
                         thousand times. I know all the 
                         punchlines, Dad. I can tell them as 
                         well as you can.
                              (closer)
                         For one night, one night in your 
                         entire life, the universe does not 
                         revolve around Edward Bloom. It 
                         revolves around me and my wife. How 
                         can you not understand that?

               A long beat, then...

                                     EDWARD
                              (low)
                         Sorry to embarrass you.

               Will won't let him get the last word.

                                     WILL
                         You're embarrassing yourself, Dad. 
                         You just don't see it.

               ANGLE ON Edward. Fine. A hand to wave, enough of you.

               He walks away.

               ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. It's then 
               we FREEZE FRAME.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         After that night, I didn't speak to 
                         my father again for three years.

               INT. A.P. NEWSROOM (PARIS) - DAY

               A typically busy day. On hold with the phone cradled under 
               an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his 
               desk.

                                     WILL (ON PHONE)
                              (without pauses)
                         William Bloom with the Associated 
                         Press if I could just...

               He's put back on hold. Returning to the mail, he finds a 
               hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         We communicated indirectly I guess. 
                         In her letters and Christmas cards, 
                         my mother would write for both of 
                         them.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a 
               sandwich.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         When I'd call, Mom would say that 
                         Dad was out driving. Or swimming in 
                         the pool.

               Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich.

                                     WILL
                         True to form, we never talked about 
                         our not talking.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Sandra stands by the window, watching as...

               EXT. BLOOM BACK YARD - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I didn't see anything 
                         of myself in my father, and I don't 
                         think he saw anything of himself in 
                         me. We were like strangers who knew 
                         each other very well.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         In telling the story of my father's 
                         life, it's impossible to separate 
                         the fact from the fiction, the man 
                         from the myth. The best I can do is 
                         to tell it the way he told me.

               We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught 
               in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something 
               changes.

               Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 
               20's, staring into the water. He's not just handsome, not 
               just charming. It's as if all the forces of the natural world 
               had conspired to create him.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         It doesn't always make sense, and 
                         most of it never happened.

               Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, 
               grabbing hold of

               THE BEAST.

               He brings the catfish up to his face. Looks it right in the 
               eye. A beat, then the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         But that's what kind of story this 
                         is.

               Smiling, Edward takes the ring, then throws the Beast back 
               into the water with a splash.

               TITLE OVER:

                                         BIG FISH

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Young Dr. Bennett stands between the Wife's legs. She's 
               flustered and sweating, but the doctor has a comforting 
               bedside manner...

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Now, Mrs. Bloom, I'll need you to 
                         give me one good push. On three. 
                         One...

               Suddenly, we hear a POP as a slimy mass of human being rockets 
               into the doctor's unprepared hands. Bennett tries to hold 
               tight, but the infant is slippery like a fish. It shoots up 
               into air.

               The NURSES and the Husband try to grab the baby, but no one 
               can hold it. As the newborn sails upward TOWARDS CAMERA, we 
               can see a GIGGLING SMILE on its face.

               As it falls, the newborn knocks over a tray, which provides 
               it a ramp to slide right out of the room. Everyone races 
               after it.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Bursting through the doors --

                                     YOUNG DR. BENNETT
                         Grab that baby!

               A NURSE finally scoops up the slippery baby. Everyone lets 
               out a collective sigh of relief.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         My father's birth would set the pace 
                         for his unlikely life. No longer 
                         than most men's, but larger. And as 
                         strange as his stories got, the 
                         endings were always the most 
                         surprising of all.

               INT. HALF-DARK PARIS APARTMENT - (PRESENT) DAY

               Over the sound of rain, a phone RINGS on a chair. By the 
               tone of the ring, we know we're not in the U.S. -- it has 
               that insistent European sound.

               As it keeps RINGING, we look to see the apartment is mostly 
               empty, just a few half-unpacked boxes. A cradle is still in 
               its carton.

               KEYS in the lock. LAUGHTER in the hallway. The door swings 
               open to reveal a drenched Will (29) carrying four sacks of 
               groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. His wife 
               Josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Allo oui?

               Will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer 
               unleashing a new drizzle. He plays it up, trying to get a 
               reaction out of Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (on phone)
                         Yes, he's here.

               She hands the phone to Will, concerned.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's your mother.

               Half-stripped, Will takes the phone. This won't be good news.

                                     WILL
                              (on phone)
                         Hi. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

               As Josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, 
               very pregnant. She listens carefully to Will's side of the 
               conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.

                                     WILL (CONT'D)
                         What does Dr. Bennett say? Okay. No, 
                         sure, let me talk to him. I'll wait.

               He covers the mouthpiece. Looks over to Josephine.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's bad.

                                     WILL
                         It's more than they thought. They're 
                         going to stop chemo.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You need to go.

                                     WILL
                         Probably tonight.

               A beat.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm going with you.

                                     WILL
                         You don't have to.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (a simple fact)
                         I'm going with you.

               INT. AIR FRANCE 747 - NIGHT

               As the plane continues boarding, a STEWARDESS recites the 
               welcome spiel in French. Will has a window seat in coach. 
               Josephine sits beside him, putting on hand lotion.

               Taking his hands, she rubs the excess into him. There's an 
               effortless intimacy between them. She can pinpoint what he's 
               feeling before he can.

               INT. 747 / FLYING - NIGHT

               Hours later, and the lights are dimmed. Most of the PASSENGERS 
               are asleep, including Josephine. Her head is propped against 
               Will's shoulder, her hands tucked under her belly.

               Will watches her sleep, brushing back her hair. A beat, then 
               he notices a BORED BOY in the next row over.

               Off the glow of the reading light, the boy is using his hands 
               to cast shadows on the seat back. The kid is pretty good, 
               making a convincing bird, a passable monkey, and finally a 
               dog.

               We PUSH IN on the silhouettes.

                                     EDWARD (O.S., PRELAP)
                         So which one's it gonna be? The Monkey 
                         in the Barn, the Dog in the Road?

               Focusing on the final shadow, we...

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE - NIGHT

               ...come to find Edward making the shapes.

               Will (6) sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him. The 
               endtable lamp lies between them, its shade off to cast big 
               shadows on the wall.

                                     WILL
                         The one about the witch.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mom says I can't tell you that 
                         one anymore. You get nightmares.

                                     WILL
                         I'm not scared.

               Edward looks around for a beat, seeing if his wife is in 
               earshot. He then leans in, complicitous.

                                     EDWARD
                         Neither was I. At first.

               Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story.

                                     EDWARD
                         This all happened in the swamp outside 
                         of Ashton. Kids weren't supposed to 
                         go out in the swamp, on account of 
                         the snakes and spiders and quicksand 
                         that would swallow you up before you 
                         could even scream. But there were 
                         five of us out there that night: Me, 
                         Ruthie, Wilbur Freely, and the Price 
                         Brothers, Don and Zacky.

               Edward holds up his hand, counting the names on his fingers.

                                     EDWARD
                         Not a one of us knew what was in 
                         store.

               As his hand moves past the light, we

                                                                   COME TO:

               A flashlight SWEEPS past. We are...

               EXT. FIELD AT THE SWAMP EDGE - NIGHT

               The night is WHIRRING and BREATHING, alive. The moon hangs 
               low, casting long shadows.

               Five kids walk past in silhouette. Four have flashlights on. 
               The fifth keeps tripping, crashing into YOUNG EDWARD (10).

                                     EDWARD
                         Zacky, turn your flashlight on!

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't got any batteries!

               Red-headed ZACKY PRICE is 10. His brother DON PRICE is 12, 
               and a lot bigger than the others. 

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then why'd you bring it?

                                     ZACKY
                         I don't want to be in the swamp with 
                         a witch and no flashlight.

               WILBUR FREELY, also 10, is the black asthmatic son of a 
               sharecropper. Redheaded RUTHIE MACKLIN, 8, is happy just to 
               be there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Is it true she got a glass eye?

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I heard she got it from Gypsies.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's a Gypsy?

                                     ZACKY
                         Your momma's a Gypsy.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Your momma's a bitch.

                                     RUTHIE
                         You shouldn't swear. There's ladies 
                         present.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Shit.

                                     ZACKY
                         Damn.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         Screw.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         Turn off your flashlights! She'll 
                         see 'em.

               MOVING UP behind the kids, we find ourselves at the gates 
               of...

               EXT. A CREEPY OLD HOUSE - NIGHT

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Now, it's common knowledge that most 
                         towns of a certain size have a witch, 
                         if only to eat misbehaving children 
                         and the occasional puppy who wanders 
                         into her yard. Witches use those 
                         bones to cast spells and curses that 
                         make the land infertile.

               We PULL BACK, and BACK, revealing more of the Gothically 
               creepy house: its broken windows, strangling vines, and eerie 
               gargoyles half-buried in the dirt. Even bats are afraid to 
               fly over it.

               In the moonlight, the house is especially sinister. Who knows 
               what is lurking in the shadows?

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Yet of the all the witches in Alabama, 
                         there was one who was the most feared. 
                         For she had one glass eye, which was 
                         said to contain mystical powers.

               We finally come to the kids, staring in through the gate.

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         I hear if you look right at it, you 
                         can see how you're gonna die.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's bull-s-h-i-t, that is. She's 
                         not even a real witch.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You're so sure, why don't you go in 
                         and get that eye? I heard she keeps 
                         it in a box on her nighttable.

               Edward looks back at the spooky house.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Or are you too scared?

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll go in right now and get that 
                         eye.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Then do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I will.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Fine, you do it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fine, I'm doing it.

               He hands Zacky his flashlight, then starts climbing the gate.

                                     RUTHIE
                         Edward, don't!

                                     WILBUR FREELY
                         She'll make soap out of you!
                              (to Ruthie)
                         That's what she does, she makes soap 
                         out of people.

               Edward drops down on the far side of the gate. Truth be told, 
               Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.

               Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. 
               They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don 
               holds him by the collar.

               EXT. APPROACHING THE HOUSE

               Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front 
               door. Anything could jump out of them.

               He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he 
               continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. 
               Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door.

               The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look 
               like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and 
               closer before he finally

               RINGS THE DOORBELL.

               Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with 
               a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead 
               for years, but too stubborn to lie down.

                                     EDWARD
                              (calm and 
                              straightforward)
                         Ma'am, my name is Edward Bloom, and 
                         there's some folks'd like to see 
                         your eye.

               EXT. BACK AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more 
               convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the 
               gate.

                                     DON PRICE
                         You get the eye?

                                     EDWARD
                         I brought it.

                                     DON PRICE
                              (dubious)
                         Let's see it.

               The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping 
               up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left 
               eye, it shines with a hellish glow.

               We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FRONT PORCH OF HOUSE - DAY

               An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing 
               a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. 
               Dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               We RUSH IN on Don Price.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY

               Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, 
               face mushed in the grout. Very much dead.

               EXT. AT THE GATE - NIGHT

               Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears 
               in his eyes.

                                     ZACKY
                         I saw how I was gonna die. I was 
                         old, and I fell.

                                     DON PRICE
                         I wasn't old at all.

               The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old 
               Woman, Edward smiles.

               EXT. AT THE OLD WOMAN'S DOOR - NIGHT

               Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but 
               curiosity gets the better of him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was thinking about death and all. 
                         About seeing how you're gonna die.

               The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him.

                                     EDWARD
                         I mean, on one hand, if dying was 
                         all you thought about, it could kind 
                         of screw you up. But it could kind 
                         of help you, couldn't it? Because 
                         you'd know that everything else you 
                         can survive.

               The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth.

                                     EDWARD
                         I guess I'm saying, I'd like to know.

               The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. 
               And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks 
               into The Eye.

               This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he 
               witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and 
               amused. Whatever he sees, it's not as dire as the other boys. 
               His future has something strange in store.

                                     EDWARD
                         Huh. That's how I go?

               The Old Woman nods. Still a little overwhelmed, Edward turns 
               and leaves.

                                     ADULT EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I no longer 
                         feared death. And for that, I was as 
                         good as immortal.

               As Edward leaves, the door swings SHUT on its own.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               INT./EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - (PRESENT) DAY

               The front door opens to reveal Will and Josephine on the 
               porch with their bags. REVERSE to Will's mother Sandra (53), 
               surprised and a little annoyed.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get here?

                                     WILL
                         We swam. The Atlantic, it's not that 
                         big really.

                                     SANDRA
                         Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up 
                         at the airport.

                                     WILL
                         We rented a car.

                                     SANDRA
                              (simply)
                         You didn't need to do that. You just 
                         didn't.

               A beat. Starting over...

                                     WILL
                         Hi, Mom.

               He leans in and hugs her. She surrenders, squeezing her son 
               tight. Will and his mother are cut from the same cloth -- 
               strong-willed but practical. They've always been close.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm so glad you're here.

               That hug finished, Sandra pushes past her son to her daughter-
               in-law. Seeing the size of her belly --

                                     SANDRA
                         You shouldn't have flown. But...

               They hug.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         It's good to see you. You look 
                         beautiful.

               It's not flattery. It's the truth.

                                     SANDRA
                         Thank you. I'll bet you need to --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Yes.

                                     SANDRA
                         Down the hall on the right. The door 
                         sticks. You have to really pull it.

               Josephine squeezes past, a smile to her husband -- be nice. 
               Will heads back to the rental car to retrieve luggage. Sandra 
               follows him.

               Coming down the driveway, we get to see the house for the 
               first time: an older suburban home, three bedrooms, big for 
               the neighborhood, and nicely grown into the lot. KIDS are 
               playing on the street.

                                     WILL
                         Is that Dr. Bennett's car?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's up with your father.

               Heading back to the house...

                                     WILL
                         How is he?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's impossible. He won't eat. And 
                         because he won't eat, he gets weaker. 
                         And because he's weaker, he doesn't 
                         want to eat.

                                     WILL
                         How much time does he have left?

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't talk about those things. 
                         Not yet.

               INT. KITCHEN - DAY

               Sandra is pouring iced tea for Will and Josephine.

               DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded 
               from coming down the stairs. He was the town's first Black 
               physician. He's still the town's best physician.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will.

                                     WILL
                         Dr. Bennett. It's good to see you.
                              (they shake)
                         My wife, Josephine.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         A pleasure.

               He judges her belly.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         You're seven months.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (impressed)
                         To the day.

               He leans close to her, whispering in her ear...

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's a boy.

               She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Will looks over -- 
               what did he say? Josephine shakes her head.

               Back to the main subject...

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't think he looks any worse.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         No. I would say he's the same.

               And in the silence that follows, a lot is said. It wasn't 
               the upbeat reply Sandra was hoping for.

                                     WILL
                         Can I see him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Absolutely. Be good for you to talk 
                         to him.

               A moment of awkwardness -- everyone here knows they haven't 
               spoken in years.

               Sandra hands Will a squat can of Ensure from the case on the 
               counter.

                                     SANDRA
                         Get him to drink one of these. He 
                         won't, but tell him he has to.

               INT. FOYER - DAY

               Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. 
               They CREAK with every step.

               The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most 
               of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant 
               and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can 
               see him growing up with every step.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the 
               end of the hallway. Will walks towards it, running a hand 
               along the wallpaper.

               Almost at the door, he stops for a beat. Gets his breath. 
               Then goes inside.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although he's not 
               the vibrant man we've seen before, it's not as bad we feared. 
               The illness has been quick, and left him largely intact.

               There are no I.V.'s, no monitors, nothing.

               Coming up to the bed --

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               Edward cracks open an eye, a beat before he focuses. He tries 
               to say something, but no words come out.

               He looks over at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him 
               a glass of water, helping him hold it to his parched lips.

               Finished, Edward sets down the glass by himself. A very long, 
               tense beat. Will almost speaks again to fill the silence.

               Finally...

                                     EDWARD
                         You --
                              (he points)
                         -- are in for a surprise.

                                     WILL
                         Am I?

                                     EDWARD
                         Having a kid changes everything. I 
                         mean, there's the diapers and the 
                         burping and the midnight feedings...

                                     WILL
                         Did you do any of that?

                                     EDWARD
                         No, but I hear it's terrible. Then 
                         you spend years trying to corrupt 
                         and mislead this child, fill its 
                         head with nonsense and still it turns 
                         out perfectly fine.

                                     WILL
                         You think I'm up for it?

                                     EDWARD
                         You learned from the best.

               Will doesn't rise to the challenge. A beat, then he remembers 
               the can of Ensure. Holds it up. Edward recoils.

                                     WILL
                         Just drink half the can. I'll tell 
                         her you drank the whole thing. 
                         Everyone wins.

               A beat, then Edward rolls his eyes. Fine. Will cracks open 
               the can, finding a straw on the nightstand.

                                     EDWARD
                         People needn't worry so much. It's 
                         not my time yet. This isn't how I 
                         go.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         Truly. I saw it in The Eye.

                                     WILL
                         The Old Lady by the swamp.

                                     EDWARD
                         She was a witch.

                                     WILL
                         No, she was old and probably senile. 
                         Maybe schizophrenic.

                                     EDWARD
                         I saw my death in that eye. And this 
                         is not how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         So how does it happen?

                                     EDWARD
                         Surprise ending. Wouldn't want to 
                         ruin it for you.

               Edward slurps down as much of the Ensure as he can stand, 
               then pushes the can away. He swallows with difficulty.

                                     EDWARD
                         There was this panhandler who used 
                         to stop me every morning when I came 
                         out of this coffee shop near the 
                         office.

                                     WILL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         And every day I gave him a quarter. 
                         Every day. Then I got sick and was 
                         out for a couple of weeks. And when 
                         I went back there, you know what he 
                         said?

                                     WILL
                         What did he say?

                                     EDWARD
                         You owe me three-fifty.

                                     WILL
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         True story.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         When did you ever work in an office?

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a lot you don't know about 
                         me.

                                     WILL
                         You're right.

               Edward gives a wry smile. He walked into that.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother was worried we wouldn't 
                         talk again. And look at us. We're 
                         talking fine. We're storytellers, 
                         both of us. I speak mine out, you 
                         write yours down. Same thing.

               Will won't commit to Edward's assessment.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about 
                         some things while I'm here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You mean, while I'm here.

                                     WILL
                         I'd just like to know the true 
                         versions of things. Events. Stories. 
                         You.

               Edward LAUGHS a little, which becomes a COUGH. The HACKING 
               escalates until another drink of water gets it under control. 
               It's not clear whether any of this was an act to keep from 
               talking.

                                     EDWARD
                         Your mother hasn't been keeping up 
                         the pool. If you wanted to you 
                         could...

                                     WILL
                         I will.

                                     EDWARD
                         You know where the chemicals are?

                                     WILL
                         I used to do it when you were gone, 
                         remember? I used to do it a lot.

               He didn't mean for that to sound so pointed. Taking the half-
               empty Ensure, Will gets up to go. He's at the door when...

                                     EDWARD
                         I was never much for being at home, 
                         Will. It's too confining. And this, 
                         here. Being stuck in bed. Dying is 
                         the worst thing that ever happened 
                         to me.

               He smiles at his joke.

                                     WILL
                         I thought you weren't dying.

                                     EDWARD
                         I said this isn't how I go. The last 
                         part is much more unusual. Trust me 
                         on that.

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

               Shutting the door behind himself, Will drinks the rest of 
               the Ensure himself. Edward was right. It tastes horrible.

               Heading for the stairs, Will walks past an open door. As he 
               leaves frame, we STAY BEHIND to look inside...

               INT. WILL'S BEDROOM - DAY [FLASHBACK]

               ...where an eight-year old Will is propped up in bed, his 
               face covered with chicken pox and pink calamine lotion. He's 
               showing Edward how many bumps there are on his arm.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Dr. Bennett says I'm going to have 
                         to be home for a week.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's nothing. I once had to stay 
                         in bed for three years.

                                     YOUNG WILL
                         Did you have chicken pox?

                                     EDWARD
                         I wish.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TINY CHURCH - DAY

               Wearing a white shirt and tie, YOUNG EDWARD -- still about 
               10 -- sings "Down to the River My Lord" along with the 
               CONGREGATION. His voice is high and thin, but he gives it 
               his all.

               Suddenly, his voice CRACKS and DROPS a half-octave. And then 
               another. His friends Wilbur Freeley and Ruthie look over, 
               wondering what's wrong. Embarrassed, Edward just keeps 
               SINGING, trying to follow along with the baritone part.

               He pulls at his collar. Then pulls again, his face getting 
               red. Starting to panic, he loosens his tie. He's starting to 
               undo the collar button when it POPS off by itself. Two more 
               buttons fly off. One hits a CHUBBY WOMAN in the neck.

               ON HIS SHOES

               As we watch, Edward's pant cuffs rise inch by inch -- that's 
               how fast he's growing.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Truth is, no one quite knew what was 
                         wrong. Most times, a person grows up 
                         gradually. I found myself in a hurry.

               INT. YOUNG EDWARD'S BEDROOM - DAY

               Young Edward lies in bed, his limbs connected to various 
               pulleys and levers to support his weight. He has a dozen 
               encyclopedias around him, and another dozen on the floor.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         My muscles couldn't keep up with my 
                         bones, and my bones couldn't keep up 
                         with my body's ambition. So I spent 
                         the better part of three years 
                         confined to my bed, with the World 
                         Book Encyclopedia being my only means 
                         of exploration. I had made it all 
                         the way to the "G's," hoping to find 
                         an answer to my gigantificationism, 
                         when I uncovered an article about 
                         the common goldfish.

               INSERT: The encyclopedia article, complete with drawings.

                                     YOUNG EDWARD
                              (reading)
                         "Kept in a small bowl, the goldfish 
                         will remain small. With more space, 
                         the fish can grow double, triple, or 
                         quadruple its size."

               Young Edward thinks this through.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It occurred to me then, that perhaps 
                         the reason for my growth was that I 
                         was intended for larger things. After 
                         all, a giant man can't have an 
                         ordinary-sized life.

               EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

               The CRACK of a bat announces the game-winning home run. The 
               crowd CHEERS the swing, and especially the batter as he rounds 
               the bases.

               Although we've seen him briefly before, this is our first 
               real exposure to GROWN-UP EDWARD, who we'll follow from 
               roughly the ages of 18 to 30.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As soon as my bones had settled in 
                         their adult configuration, I set 
                         upon my plan to make a bigger place 
                         for myself in Ashton.

               EXT. SCHOOL FIELDS - DAY

               SINGLE SHOTS: Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. 
               On the sidelines, a PRETTY GIRL admits the name of her secret 
               love:

                                     GIRL
                         Edward Bloom!

               The other GIRLS SQUEAL in agreement. Don Price looks over, 
               glowers.

               EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

               SINGLE SHOT: A lawnmower ROARS along the grass. We LOOK UP 
               to see who's pushing it, but it's not Edward. It's one of 
               his teenage EMPLOYEES.

               Edward is back at the truck, which is painted to read, "Bloom 
               Landscaping." He has workers on every lawn.

               He signs an autograph for an ADMIRING CUB SCOUT.

               INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY

               Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other 
               end of the court. Naturally, he makes it, winning the game.

               As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only 
               teammate who doesn't mob him.

               EXT. TOWN - DAY

               Edward carries a dog out of a burning house.

               INT. SCIENCE FAIR - DAY

               Edward wins a blue ribbon for his invention, a machine 
               labelled "Perpetual Motion." He and the JUDGE pose for a 
               photograph. A FLASH.

               Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the 
               trash.

               INT. HIGH SCHOOL STAGE - DAY

               A dashingly handsome Edward leads the CAST out for a curtain 
               call. He's the star of the show. Off to the side, we see Don 
               Price is the ass-end of a horse costume.

               Edward soaks in his applause, smiling and gracious.

               EXT. GRADUATION STAGE - DAY

               Edward accepts his diploma. The PRINCIPAL hugs him tight.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was the biggest thing Ashton had 
                         ever seen. Until one day, a stranger 
                         arrived.

               EXT. FARM - DAY

               As two FARMERS shake their heads, we REVERSE to a show a 
               massive hole punched through the side of a barn. It's roughly 
               the shape of man, but no human could be that large.

               EXT. SHEEP PEN - DAY

               Two fat ewes look up, a shadow falling across them. They 
               BLEAT in panic as

               TWO OVERSIZED HANDS

               reach in and scoop them up. Their protests continue as they're 
               carried away, one under each arm. We still haven't seen the 
               full stranger.

               EXT. COURT HOUSE - DAY

               A MOB of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns. 
               Amid the crowd we see Don Price.

                                     SHARECROPPER
                         He ate an entire cornfield!

                                     LITTLE GIRL
                         He ate my dog!

                                     HOT-BLOODED SHOTGUN TOTER
                         If you ain't gonna stop him Mayor, 
                         we will!

                                     MAYOR
                         I won't have mob violence in this 
                         town. Now, has someone tried talking 
                         to him?

                                     SOME FARMER
                         You can't reason with 'im!

                                     SHEPHARD
                         He's a monster!

               Agreement from the crowd. And then...

                                     A VOICE (O.S.)
                         I'll do it.

               Everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal 
               none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll talk to him. See if I can get 
                         him to move on.

                                     MAYOR
                         Son, that creature could crush you 
                         without trying.

                                     EDWARD
                         Trust me, he'll have to try.

               EXT. HILL OUTSIDE ASHTON - DAY

               Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching 
               the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the 
               remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked 
               clean.

               In his most serious voice, Edward calls out:

                                     EDWARD
                         Hello!

               There's no answer.

                                     EDWARD
                         My name is Edward Bloom! I want to 
                         talk to you!

               From deep in a cave, a thunderous voice:

                                     VOICE (O.S.)
                         GO AWAY!

               The giant's voice has such force, it blows Edward's hair 
               back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm not going anywhere until you 
                         show yourself.

               A beat, then we hear a RUMBLE, like a train coming. Edward 
               braces himself, fists ready for a fight, if that's what it's 
               going to take.

               As the RUMBLE gets louder, the ground starts to shake. Even 
               Edward starts to worry. Just how big is this guy?

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Armed with the foreknowledge of my 
                         own death, I knew the giant couldn't 
                         kill me. All the same, I preferred 
                         to keep my bones unbroken.

               Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath.

               Then suddenly, the giant bursts forth. Hunched over, he slams 
               into a stunned Edward, knocking him halfway down the hill.

               KARL THE GIANT is bigger than any man you've ever seen. Not 
               just tall, but massive. He's completely feral, with a beard 
               to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains 
               of his clothes are ragged and muddy. God knows what's living 
               in his matted hair.

               Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his 
               rock, but it just bounces off. The giant didn't even notice 
               it.

                                     KARL
                         Why are you here?

               Edward ponders the best response, settling on...

                                     EDWARD
                         So you can eat me. The town decided 
                         to send a human sacrifice, and I 
                         volunteered.

               Karl's eyes narrow, confused. Edward stands up.

                                     EDWARD
                         My arms are a little stringy, but 
                         there's some good eating on my legs. 
                         I mean, I'd be tempted to eat them 
                         myself.
                              (beat)
                         So I guess, just, if you could get 
                         it over with quick. Because I'm not 
                         much for pain, really.

               Edward closes his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. 
               Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do.

               After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see 
               what the giant is doing. Relieved to see he's not licking 
               his chops --

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I can't go back. I'm a human 
                         sacrifice. If I go back, everyone 
                         will think I'm a coward. And I'd 
                         rather be dinner than a coward.

               Karl sits down with a BOOM, dejected.

                                     EDWARD
                         Here, start with my hand. It'll be 
                         an appetizer.

               Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth. But 
               the giant spits it back out.

                                     KARL
                         I don't want to eat you. I don't 
                         want to eat anybody. It's just I get 
                         so hungry. I'm too big.

               And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak -- 
               a giant man, but in the end, just a man.

               Edward takes a seat beside him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you ever think maybe you're not 
                         too big? Maybe this town's just too 
                         small. I mean, look at it.

               Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town 
               in a tiny valley.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hardly two stories in the whole place. 
                         Now I've heard in real cities, they've 
                         got buildings so tall you can't even 
                         see the tops of 'em.

                                     KARL
                         Really?

                                     EDWARD
                         Wouldn't lie to you. And they've got 
                         all-you-can-eat buffets. You can eat 
                         a lot, can't you?

                                     KARL
                         I can.

                                     EDWARD
                         So why are you wasting your time in 
                         a small town? You're a big man. You 
                         should be in the big city.

               Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion --

                                     KARL
                         You're just trying to get me to leave, 
                         aren't you? That's why they sent you 
                         here.

                                     EDWARD
                         What's your name, Giant?

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mine's Edward. And truthfully, I do 
                         want you to leave, Karl. But I want 
                         to leave with you.
                              (closer)
                         You think this town is too small for 
                         you, well, it's too small for a man 
                         of my ambition. I can't see staying 
                         here a day longer.

                                     KARL
                         You don't like it?

                                     EDWARD
                         I love every square inch of it. But 
                         I can feel the edges closing in on 
                         me. A man's life can only grow to a 
                         certain size in a place like this.
                              (beat)
                         So what do you say? Join me?

               Karl thinks a moment. Then --

                                     KARL
                         Okay.

                                     EDWARD
                         Okay.

               They shake on it.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now first, we gotta get you ready 
                         for the city.

               EXT. RIVER - DAY

               IN A SINGLE SHOT, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, 
               while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt.

               EXT. MAIN STREET OF ASHTON - DAY

               Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the 
               good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and 
               Karl.

               There's a few tears amid the familiar faces.

                                     MAYOR
                              (loudly, for the crowd)
                         Edward Bloom, first son of Ashton, 
                         it's with a heavy heart we see you 
                         go. But take with you this Key to 
                         the City, and know that any time you 
                         want to come back, all our doors are 
                         open to you.

               Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his 
               neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start 
               walking, waving as they go.

               Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward 
               go. He crushes his cigarette under his heel. He wishes he 
               could crush Edward.

               Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or 
               shake his hand.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         That afternoon as I left Ashton, 
                         everyone seemed to have advice.

                                     VARIOUS TOWNFOLK
                         Find yourself a nice girl! Don't 
                         trust anyone in Kentucky! Watch your 
                         pride, Edward Bloom!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         But there was one person whose counsel 
                         I held above all others.

               As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with

               THE OLD WOMAN.

               The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been 
               cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper 
               something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear 
               her voice.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         She said that the biggest fish in 
                         the river gets that way by never 
                         being caught.

               The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to the Old Woman)
                         Okay. Thanks.

               Edward and Karl keep walking. The Old Woman shuffles off, 
               somehow knowing her advice will go unheeded.

                                     KARL
                         What did she say?

                                     EDWARD
                         Beats me.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking 
               out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly 
               possessions.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There were two roads out of Ashton, 
                         a new one which was paved, and an 
                         older one that wasn't. People didn't 
                         use the old road anymore, and it had 
                         developed the reputation of being 
                         haunted.

               Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers 
               left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road 
               is blocked with signs and warnings of danger.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Since I had no intention of ever 
                         returning to Ashton, this seemed as 
                         good a time as any to find out what 
                         lay down that old road.

               Karl looks at the dirt road, wary.

                                     KARL
                         You know anyone's who's taken it?

                                     EDWARD
                         That poet, Norther Winslow did. He 
                         was going to Paris, France. He must 
                         have liked it, because no one ever 
                         heard from him again.
                              (beat)
                         Tell you what. You take the other 
                         way and I'll cut through here. Meet 
                         you on the far side.

               A little paranoid...

                                     KARL
                         You're not trying to run away?

                                     EDWARD
                         Just to be sure, you can take my 
                         pack.

               Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry.

               EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

               The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is 
               still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING.

               Spinning the Key to the City, Edward WHISTLES, because it's 
               a day meant for whistling.

               EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH

               The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight 
               break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the 
               air. Still, Edward WHISTLES.

               Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny 
               vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, 
               he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is 
               dead quiet.

               He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It 
               would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on.

               He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch 
               on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR.

               FURTHER ALONG

               A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING 
               BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at 
               them.

               Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right 
               out of his hands.

                                     EDWARD
                         You stupid sonofa...

               He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The 
               stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm 
               roars out.

               Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious.

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER]

               Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung.

               A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. 
               Reads it:

                                         WARNING!

                                     JUMPING SPIDERS!

               Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with 
               thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There comes a point where a reasonable 
                         man will swallow his pride and admit 
                         he's made a terrible mistake. The 
                         truth is, I was never a reasonable 
                         man.

               Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs.

                                     EDWARD
                         And what I recalled of Sunday School 
                         was that the more difficult something 
                         became, the more rewarding it was in 
                         the end.

               EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY

               Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs 
               off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in 
               his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he 
               still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind.

               At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty 
               and comforting.

               Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- 
               with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling 
               from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their 
               laces tied together.

               He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!"

               EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY

               It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, 
               Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is 
               old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group 
               of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. 
               Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy.

               What's more, all of these people are barefoot.

                                     MAN'S VOICE
                         Friend!

               A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store 
               to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest 
               thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Welcome to ya. What's your name?

                                     EDWARD
                         Edward Bloom.

               Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips 
               forward a few pages. Still looking...

                                     BEAMEN
                         Bloom like a flower?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. 
                         We weren't expecting you yet.

               Still confused...

                                     EDWARD
                         You were expecting me?

                                     BEAMEN
                         Not yet.

               A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in:

                                     MILDRED
                         You must have taken a shortcut.

                                     EDWARD
                         I did. It nearly killed me.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And 
                         truthfully, the long way is easier, 
                         but it's longer.

                                     MILDRED
                         Much longer.

                                     BEAMEN
                         And you're here now, and that's what 
                         matters.

               Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering 
               around to look at the handsome stranger.

                                     EDWARD
                         What is this place?

                                     BEAMEN
                         The town of Spectre. Best kept secret 
                         in Alabama. Says here you're from 
                         Ashton, right? Last person we had 
                         from Ashton was Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD
                         The poet? What ever happened to him?

                                     BEAMEN
                         He's still here. Let me buy you a 
                         drink. I'll tell you all about it. 
                         Hell, I'll have him tell you.

                                     EDWARD
                         No. I've gotta meet somebody. I'm 
                         already running late.

               He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's 
               laughing.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Son, I already told you. You're early.

               INT. BEAMEN'S HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of 
               apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), 
               who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never 
               left the state.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Now tell me if that isn't the best 
                         pie you ever ate.

                                     EDWARD
                         It truly is.

               UNDER THE TABLE

               Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Everything here tastes better. Even 
                         the water is sweet. Never gets too 
                         hot, too cold, too humid. At night 
                         the wind goes through the trees and 
                         you'd swear there was a whole symphony 
                         out there, playing just for you.

               Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the 
               door.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hey!

               He chases after her.

               EXT. TOWN / MAIN STREET - DAY

               As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching 
               the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the 
               power line -- a perfect throw. There's no way he's ever 
               getting them down.

               The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is 
               confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his 
               hand.

               Still focused on his shoes...

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I need those!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There is no softer ground than town.

                                     MILDRED
                         That rhymes!

                                     BEAMEN
                         He is our poet laureate.

               The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward... 

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Sometimes in a dream, you'll visit 
                         places that seem instantly familiar, 
                         filled with friends you've never 
                         met.

               EXT. UNDER A TREE - DUSK

               Edward sits with Norther Winslow. The fireflies are out. 
               Thousands of them.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A man might travel his entire life 
                         and never find a place so inviting. 
                         My journey had scarcely begun, and I 
                         had arrived.

               Norther hands him his noteboook.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I've been working on this poem for 
                         12 years.

                                     EDWARD
                         Really.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         There's a lot of expectation. I don't 
                         want to disappoint my fans.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's only three lines long.

               Norther grabs his notebook back.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is why you don't show work in 
                         progress.

                                     EDWARD
                         Norther, do you ever regret not making 
                         it to Paris?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I can't imagine any place better 
                         than here.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're a poet. You oughta be able 
                         to. And maybe if you'd seen more, 
                         you could.

               Norther doesn't answer. Just goes back to his notebook.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT

               By the light of the full moon, Edward soaks his feet in the 
               water, trying to make sense of it all. The Key to the City 
               dangles around his neck.

               He stares at himself in the reflection. He smiles.

               It's then that a WOMAN emerges at the far side of the river.

               No telling where she came from -- she must have been swimming 
               underwater. We never see her face.

               She stands in the river with her bare back to Edward, 
               squeezing the water out of her golden hair, oblivious to his 
               presence. Edward is breathless. It's the first woman he's 
               seen in her natural state, and he doesn't dare move lest he 
               frighten her away.

               Then he sees the snake.

               It's a cottonmouth, has to be. It leaves a break in the water, 
               its small reptilian head aiming for her flesh.

               There's no decision to be made. On pure instinct, Edward 
               dives in. He swims as hard as can,

               GRABBING THE SNAKE

               just as it's about to strike.

               The woman dives back underwater, understandably terrified 
               that a man is coming at her.

                                     EDWARD
                         No, it's okay! I got it. I got the 
                         snake.

               As the splashing subsides, Edward looks at what he holds in 
               his hands. Which isn't a snake at all, but rather a common 
               stick. And a non-threatening one at that.

               While Edward ponders his mistake, he looks around to discover 
               that the Girl in the River is gone. He never even saw her 
               face.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait! I'm sorry. Hello?!

               Edward keeps expecting her to surface, somewhere, but she 
               never does. He stands alone in the river, wondering what 
               tricks his eyes are playing on him.

               EXT. BY THE RIVER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

                                     A GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         There's leeches in there!

               Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did you see that woman?

                                     JENNY
                         What did she look like?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, she... uh...

                                     JENNY
                         Was she nekkid?

               Embarrassed to admit it...

                                     EDWARD
                         Yeah.

                                     JENNY
                              (matter-of-fact)
                         It's not a woman, it's a fish. No 
                         one ever catches her.

               Given the day he's had so far, Edward isn't inclined to follow 
               up on the issue. He starts to wade back to the bank.

                                     JENNY (CONT'D)
                         Fish looks diff'rent to diff'rent 
                         people. My daddy said it looked like 
                         the coon dog he had when he was kid, 
                         back from the dead.

               Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He 
               pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging 
               to his skin.

                                     EDWARD
                         Shoot.

               He starts to work pulling them off.

               EXT. PATH BACK TO TOWN - NIGHT

               Edward and Jenny walk back.

                                     JENNY
                         How old are you?

                                     EDWARD
                         Eighteen.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm eight. That means when I'm 
                         eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 
                         28, you'll only be 38.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a little wary)
                         You're pretty good at arithmetic.

                                     JENNY
                         And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And 
                         that's not much difference at all.

               Eager to get off this subject...

                                     EDWARD
                         Sure is a lot now, though, huh?

               EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

               As Edward and Jenny approach Main Street, they find "downtown" 
               has been transformed. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables 
               across the street, and a small stage has been built at one 
               end to hold FIDDLERS.

               The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, 
               Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed 
               him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them.

               The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and 
               complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants 
               to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a 
               stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast.

               Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly.

               Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.

               Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear 
               over the MUSIC.

                                     MILDRED
                         Jenny thinks you're quite a catch. 
                         We all do.

                                     EDWARD
                              (not hearing)
                         What?

                                     MILDRED
                         I said you're quite a catch!

               Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of 
               the crowd. Beamen is there, with Jenny on his shoulders.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have to leave. Tonight.

                                     BEAMEN
                         Why?

                                     EDWARD
                         This town is everything a man could 
                         ask for. And if I were to end up 
                         here, I'd consider myself lucky. But 
                         the fact is, I'm not ready to end up 
                         anywhere.

                                     BEAMEN
                         No one's ever left.

                                     JENNY
                         How are you gonna make it without 
                         your shoes?

                                     EDWARD
                         I suspect it will hurt a lot.

               And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople 
               stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads.

               Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy.

                                     BEAMEN
                              (calling after him)
                         You won't find a better place!

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't expect to.

               Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could.

                                     JENNY
                         Promise me you'll come back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I promise. Someday. When I'm really 
                         supposed to.

               It's not good enough, but it will have to do. Edward keeps 
               walking. 

               EXT. THE DARK FOREST - NIGHT

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. 
               It's horrible. Almost unendurable.

               And then it gets worse.

               The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be 
               the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood 
               CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying 
               to block him.

               Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for 
               his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab 
               another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now 
               all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes 
               towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As difficult as it was to reach 
                         Spectre, I was fated to get there 
                         eventually. After all, no man can 
                         avoid reaching the end of his life.

               As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the 
               City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally 
               breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud.

               Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees 
               have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush 
               him.

               He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone.

                                     EDWARD
                         And then I realized, this wasn't the 
                         end of my life.

               With a sudden calm...

                                     EDWARD
                              (aloud)
                         This isn't how I die.

               Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back 
               where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn 
               in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING.

               EXT. THE ROAD - DAY

               His bare foot steps onto asphalt.

                                     A DEEP VOICE
                         Friend!

               Edward turns to see

               KARL

               to his right, coming down the larger, paved road.

                                     KARL
                         What happened to your shoes?

               Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet.

                                     EDWARD
                         They got ahead of me.

               With that, the men start walking down the larger road.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra 
               and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small 
               plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's 
               exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain 
               the family dinner ritual.

               The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a 
               knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know if you've seen it, but 
                         Josephine has some photos in the 
                         most recent Newsweek.

                                     SANDRA
                         Really! That's wonderful.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I spent a week in Morocco for the 
                         story. It was incredible.

                                     SANDRA
                         We'll have to pick up a copy.

               A beat. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward 
               suddenly speaks:

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't know if you're aware of this, 
                         Josephine, but African parrots, in 
                         their native home of the Congo -- 
                         they speak only French.

               All three stop to listen.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (amused)
                         Really.

                                     EDWARD
                         You're lucky to get four words out 
                         of them in English. But if you were 
                         to walk through the jungle, you'd 
                         hear them speaking the most elaborate 
                         French. Those parrots talk about 
                         everything: politics, movies, fashion -- 
                         everything but religion.

               Taking the bait...

                                     WILL
                         Why not religion, Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         It's rude to talk about religion. 
                         You never know who you're going to 
                         offend.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine actually went to the Congo 
                         last year.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh, so you know.

               INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

               Will shakes a shopping cart free from the pile-up while his 
               mother checks her list.

               AT THE PRODUCE SECTION

               Sandra starts to bag string beans.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, would you say you understand 
                         Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Of course.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, do you really know 
                         what's going on in his head? 

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes.

                                     WILL
                         How is that possible? I mean, you 
                         try to ask him a question and suddenly 
                         it's another one of his stories.
                              (decidedly)
                         You can't honestly say you know him.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume 
                         things you don't know.

               She's more amused than annoyed, but Will is entering dangerous 
               territory.

                                     SANDRA
                         Would you say you understand 
                         Josephine?

                                     WILL
                         Yes. But that's a different...

                                     SANDRA
                         No it's not. It's exactly the same. 
                         Your father and I met, we dated, and 
                         we married -- we chose each other -- 
                         because we understood each other on 
                         some fundamental level. Just the 
                         same as you two.

               She moves on to the carrots.

                                     WILL
                         Josephine and I have a lot in common.

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes, you both think William Bloom is 
                         a very smart man.
                              (beat)
                         The problem is, you only see me as 
                         your mother, and not as someone's 
                         wife. And I've been his wife longer 
                         than I've been your mother. You can't 
                         discount that.

                                     WILL
                         True. But I've known him my whole 
                         life, and I don't feel like I know 
                         him at all. Or ever will.

               With a look, Sandra acknowledges the stakes.

                                     SANDRA
                         I know it's not easy. Just remember, 
                         he didn't choose to be your father 
                         and you didn't choose to be his son. 
                         You just ended up together. You could 
                         pick numbers out of a dark bag and 
                         it'd be just the same. If you ask 
                         me, it's a wonder parents and children 
                         can stand each other at all.

                                     WILL
                         But I understand you, Mom. I always 
                         have.

                                     SANDRA
                         Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not 
                         the mystery you're trying to solve 
                         right now.

               INT. AT THE CHECKOUT - NIGHT

               Reaching the CASHIER, Sandra hands over her coupons. Will is 
               approaching with a Newsweek magazine.

               Two checkstands over, an ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN in her 50's

               is getting her change. Though she's Sandra's generation, she 
               carries herself like a much younger woman, with blue jeans 
               and sneakers.

               She accidentally makes eye contact with Will as he passes. 
               We HOLD ON the woman, who tracks Will as he reaches Sandra. 
               It's hard to read her reaction: does she recognize him, or 
               just find him attractive?

               Will notices the gaze. The woman turns away.

               Will racks his brain -- does he know this woman?

                                     SANDRA
                         Before I forget, your father has 
                         papers in the basement I'd like you 
                         to go through. I wouldn't know what's 
                         important.

                                     WILL
                              (distracted)
                         Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde 
                         hair.

               Sandra looks. After a beat, the Blonde Woman turns again, 
               semi-casually. Noticing that both Will and Sandra are looking, 
               she smiles a little before taking her cart to leave.

                                     SANDRA
                              (no idea)
                         Was she one of your teachers?

                                     WILL
                         No. But it's weird. She seemed to 
                         recognize me.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to the cashier)
                         Do you know who that is?

               The Cashier turns to look. He can only get a profile as the 
               woman leaves.

                                     CASHIER
                         Never seen her before. Pretty, though.

               INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

               A portable fan quietly WHIRRS in the corner. Turned low, the 
               RADIO on the nightstand is playing a call-in AM sports show, 
               just a wash of background chatter. Edward lies asleep on his 
               back.

               At the window, Josephine quietly lowers the shade. She reaches 
               over Edward to switch off the radio. He stirs from the silence -- 
               he wasn't fully asleep -- and sees Josephine stretched over 
               him.

                                     EDWARD
                              (playfully lecherous)
                         Hello.

               She smiles.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Hi. How are you feeling?

                                     EDWARD
                         I was dreaming.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What were you dreaming about?

               He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine 
               motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't usually remember unless 
                         they're especially portentous. You 
                         know what that word means, portentous?

               She shakes her head.

                                     EDWARD
                         Means when you dream about something 
                         that's going to happen.
                              (beat, gathering)
                         Like one night, I had a dream where 
                         this crow came and told me, "Your 
                         Aunt is going to die." I was so scared 
                         I woke up my parents. They told me 
                         it was just a dream, to go back to 
                         bed. But the next morning, my Aunt 
                         Stacy was dead.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         That's terrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Terrible for her, but think about 
                         me, young boy with that kind of power. 
                         Wasn't three weeks later that the 
                         crow came back to me in a dream and 
                         said, "Your Grampa is going to die." 
                         Well, I ran right back to my parents. 
                         My father said, no, Gramps is fine, 
                         but I could see there was trepidation. 
                         And true enough, that next morning 
                         my Grampa was dead.

               He sits up a bit in bed, his strength returning.

                                     EDWARD
                         For the next couple weeks, I didn't 
                         have another dream. Until one night 
                         the crow came back and said, "Your 
                         Daddy is going to die."
                              (beat)
                         Well, I didn't know what to do. But 
                         finally I told my father. And he 
                         said not to worry, but I could tell 
                         he was rattled. That next day, he 
                         wasn't himself, always looking around, 
                         waiting for something to drop on his 
                         head. Because the crow didn't tell 
                         how it was going to happen, just 
                         those words: your Daddy is going to 
                         die. Well, he went into town early 
                         and was gone for a long time. And 
                         when he finally came back, he looked 
                         terrible, like he was waiting for 
                         the axe to fall all day. He said to 
                         my mother, "Good God. I just had the 
                         worst day of my life."
                              (beat)
                         "You think you've had a bad day," 
                         she said. "This morning the milkman 
                         dropped dead on the porch!" Josephine 
                         smiles, a half-laugh, which gets him 
                         smiling too.

               A long beat. Then, deadpan...

                                     EDWARD
                         Because see, my mother was banging 
                         the milkman.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No, I understand.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was slipping her a little extra 
                         cream.

               She nods, a bit more of a laugh.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was filling her basket. He was 
                         making deliveries around back.

               As Edward continues, she can't help but laugh harder, 
               especially as the metaphors get more vulgar.

                                     EDWARD
                         He was buttering her rolls. Pumping 
                         her churn. Splashing milk in her 
                         box.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Stop.

                                     EDWARD
                         They were squeezing the cheese. 
                         Clanking the bottles. Licking the 
                         popsicle.

               She's starting to cry from laughing.

                                     EDWARD
                         Cracking the eggs and making an 
                         omelet.

               With that, he stops. She regains her composure.

                                     EDWARD
                         Spooning the sherbet.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (interrupting)
                         Can I take your picture?

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't need a picture. Just look 
                         up handsome in the dictionary.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Please?

               He rolls his eyes, why not.

               Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. 
               We STAY WITH Edward in bed.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         I have photos from the wedding to 
                         show you. There's a great one of you 
                         and my father. I had an extra print 
                         made.

               Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding 
               how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.

               He controls his breathing, trying to push through it.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I want to see pictures of your 
                         wedding. I've never seen any.

               She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job 
               masking the pain.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's because we didn't have a 
                         wedding. Your mother-in-law was never 
                         supposed to marry me. She was engaged 
                         to somebody else.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (loading film)
                         I never knew.

                                     EDWARD
                         Will never told you that?
                              (she shakes her head)
                         Probably just as well. He would have 
                         told it all wrong anyway. All the 
                         facts and none of the flavor.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Oh, so this is a tall tale?

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, it's not a short one.

               A devilish smile. Pushing past Edward, we settle on the 
               whirling fan.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               SPINNING PINWHEEL

               held by a LITTLE BOY. He's slumped over his FATHER's shoulder, 
               being carried towards a big-top tent. We are...

               EXT. OLYMPIA CIRCUS - NIGHT

               ...where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment 
               in an Alabama field. To the left, we spot Edward, 20-ish, 
               halfway through a bag of peanuts. He's still carrying the 
               backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip 
               through Spectre.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I had just left Ashton, and was on 
                         my way to discover my destiny. Not 
                         knowing what that would be exactly, 
                         I explored every opportunity that 
                         presented itself.

               Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

               A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act 
               to tremendous APPLAUSE.

               As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster 
               AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be 
               four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence.

                                     AMOS
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, you may think 
                         you've seen the unusual. You may 
                         think you've seen the bizarre. But 
                         I've travelled to the five corners 
                         of the world, and let me tell you, 
                         I've never seen anything like this.

               From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards 
               the crowd.

                                     AMOS
                         When I found this man, he was picking 
                         oranges in Florida. His fellow workers 
                         called him El Penumbra -- The Shadow -- 
                         because when you were working beside 
                         him, he blocked out the daylight. He 
                         could take a whole tree in his hands 
                         and shake off the fruit. I had to 
                         pay his crew boss $10,000 just so I 
                         could take him with me.

               Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a 
               quieter moment.

                                     AMOS
                         Not to alarm you, Ma'am. But if this 
                         man wanted to, he could crush your 
                         head between his toes.
                              (she trembles)
                         But he won't.
                              (a long beat)
                         He's not going to hurt her, folks, 
                         because he's our own Gentle Giant. 
                         Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you 
                         Colossus!

               The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL 
               begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside.

               A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. 
               That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. 
               Intrigued.

               As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. 
               Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. This is 
               COLOSSUS.

               From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he 
               is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and 
               giant club, he seems more ogre than man.

               In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. Colossus 
               walks down the row, letting the crowd get a better look at 
               him. Some reach out to touch him, disbelieving. A tight 
               spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd.

               Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with 
               the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention.

               He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is 
               sitting on the dirt --

               KARL THE GIANT

               stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold 
               him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP 
               from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will 
               happen next?

               ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling.

               ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned 
               shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into 
               the shadows.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT / LATER

               As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos.

                                     AMOS
                         What's his name? Does he talk? It's 
                         not important.

                                     KARL
                         Karl.

                                     AMOS
                         Tell me Karl, have you ever heard of 
                         the term "involuntary servitude?"

               Karl shakes his head.

                                     AMOS
                         "Unconscionable contract?"

               Nope.

                                     AMOS
                         Great, great. That's fantastic.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It was on that night Karl met his 
                         destiny. And I met mine. Almost.

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

               As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward 
               notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. 
               She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she 
               looks back at Edward.

               The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES.

               A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A 
               spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a 
               snowflake. Even the elephant is mid-poop.

               Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the 
               frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and 
               closer to this woman.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         They say when you meet the love of 
                         your life, time stops. And that's 
                         true. What they don't tell you, is 
                         that once time starts again, it moves 
                         extra fast to catch up.

               Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and 
               the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's 
               frozen, helpless in time.

               EXT. DIRT PARKING LOT - NIGHT

               Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his 
               fated love. Not finding her, he becomes more frantic, running 
               down the rows.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               THE EMPTY LOT

               Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops 
               and lets him climb in back.

               As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll 
               never find that girl, the love of his life.

               INT. BIG-TOP - NIGHT

               Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He 
               spots Edward walking back into the tent.

                                     AMOS
                         Hey kid! Your friend just made himself 
                         a star.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great.

               Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN.

                                     (INTRODUCING)
                         My attorney, Mr. Soggybottom.

                                     EDWARD
                         Good to meet you.

               Mr. Soggybottom HONKS his horn, then waddles off.

                                     AMOS
                         What's the matter with you, kid? I 
                         haven't seen a customer so depressed 
                         since the elephant sat on that 
                         farmer's wife.
                              (beat)
                         Get it? "Depressed?"

               Karl chuckles.

                                     AMOS
                         See! The big guy likes it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I just saw the woman I'm going to 
                         marry, I know it. But then I lost 
                         her.

                                     AMOS
                         Tough break. Most men have to get 
                         married before they lose their wives.

                                     EDWARD
                              (with absolute 
                              conviction)
                         I'm going to spend the rest of my 
                         life looking for her. That or die 
                         alone.

                                     AMOS
                         Jesus, kid.
                              (realizing)
                         Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde 
                         hair, blue hat?

                                     EDWARD
                         Yes!

                                     AMOS
                         I know her uncle. Friends of the 
                         family.

                                     EDWARD
                         Who is she? Where does she live?

                                     AMOS
                         Kid. Don't waste your time. She's 
                         out of your league.

               As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with 
               him. Karl follows as well.

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you mean? You don't even 
                         know me.

                                     AMOS
                         Sure I do. You were hot shit back in 
                         Hickville, but here in the real world, 
                         you got squat. You don't have a plan. 
                         You don't have a job. You don't have 
                         anything but the clothes on your 
                         back.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've got a whole backpack full of 
                         clothes!

               He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found.

                                     EDWARD
                              (realizing)
                         Someone stole my backpack.

                                     AMOS
                         Kid, you were a big fish in a small 
                         pond. This here is the ocean, and 
                         you're drowning. Take my advice and 
                         go back to Puddleville. You'll be 
                         happy there.

               Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him.

                                     EDWARD
                         Wait. You said I don't have a plan. 
                         I do. I'm going to find that girl 
                         and marry her and spend the rest of 
                         my life with her.

               Amos smiles, amused.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't have a job, but I would have 
                         a job if you gave me one. And I may 
                         not have much, but I have more 
                         determination than any man you're 
                         ever going to meet.

                                     AMOS
                         Sorry, kid. I don't do charity.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll work night and day, and you 
                         won't have to pay me. You just have 
                         to tell me who she is.

               Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he 
               can say no. He shrugs. What the hell.

                                     AMOS
                         Every month you work for me, I'll 
                         tell you one thing about her. That's 
                         my final offer.

               Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. 
               We move into a MONTAGE:

               INT. BIG TOP CENTER RING - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to 
               the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it 
               in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are 
               just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward 
               is dead.

               The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes 
               Edward antsier.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         From that moment on, I did everything 
                         Mr. Calloway asked, and a lot of 
                         things he didn't. I'd go three days 
                         without stopping to eat, and four 
                         days without sleeping.

               EXT. THE HYDRA - DAY

               His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling 
               amusement park ride.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The only thing that kept me going 
                         was the promise of meeting the girl 
                         who would be my wife.

               Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the 
               spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the 
               gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the 
               air.

               EXT. FIELD - DAY

               Edward chases a costumed pig, tripping over tent cords, 
               falling in the mud.

               His hunt leads him through the back of a tent, where he's 
               unwittingly stepped in front of a line of motorized birds. 
               To the left, CUSTOMERS are shooting with rifles. He dodges 
               four SHOTS that knock down the birds around him.

               He catches his breath, lucky.

               Then a half-blind OLD WOMAN pulls her trigger, hitting him 
               in the shoulder.

               EXT. BEHIND A TENT - DAY

               Karl the Giant bandages Edward's arm as well as he can. Amos 
               is walking past.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's been a month today.

               Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally...

                                     AMOS
                         This girl, the love of your life. 
                         Her favorite flower is daffodils.

               He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the 
               concept.

                                     EDWARD
                         Daffodils.
                              (to Karl)
                         Daffodils!

               INT. STABLES - DAY

               Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen. 
               But all he can think about is...

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Daffodils!

               The wonder of it. He goes back to shoveling, a smile on his 
               face.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         True to his word, every month Amos 
                         would tell me something new about 
                         the woman of my dreams.

               INT. A DARK PLACE - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest 
               bit of information.

                                     EDWARD
                         College! She's going to college!

               A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot...

               INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               ...out of a giant cannon.

               INT. STABLES - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward feeds the animals.

                                     EDWARD
                              (to himself)
                         Music! She likes music. I like music 
                         too!

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the months, I learned a lot 
                         about the woman I was going to marry, 
                         but not her name, and not where to 
                         find her.

               That time had come. I couldn't wait any longer.

               EXT. AMOS CALLOWAY'S TRAILER - NIGHT

               Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, 
               and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. 
               Not just that, there's MOANING coming from inside.

               But Edward KNOCKS anyway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Mr. Calloway! It's Edward Bloom. I 
                         need to talk to you.

               Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the 
               door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck.

               Edward turns the knob.

               Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a 
               massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green 
               glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue.

               Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his 
               throat. 

               Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but 
               the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold 
               on tight.

               Entwined, they roll across the dirt. The other nearby CARNIES 
               scatter for cover. Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of 
               his clown suit. Loads a silver bullet.

               Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls 
               to his feet.

               The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready 
               for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming 
               the revolver at the dog.

               At the last moment...

                                     EDWARD
                         No, wait!

               Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches 
               Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down.

               The carnies GASP.

               Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, 
               who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of 
               weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, 
               ready to strike it.

               Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces 
               excitedly, ready to play fetch.

               Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he 
               can. The dog bounds after it,

               SMASHING DOWN THREE CARS.

               It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it 
               drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth.

                                     EDWARD
                         It was that night I discovered that 
                         most things you consider evil or 
                         wicked are simply lonely, and lacking 
                         in the social niceties.

               Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new 
               direction.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. FIELD - PRE-DAWN

               Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the 
               stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's 
               gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes 
               concerned.

               He follows it into the woods.

               INT. WOODS - DAWN

               Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. 
               He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as 
               Edward approaches.

                                     AMOS
                         Didn't kill anything, did I?

                                     EDWARD
                         A few rabbits, but I think one of 
                         them was already dead.

                                     AMOS
                         That would explain the indigestion.

               Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates.

                                     AMOS
                         I was wrong about you kid. You may 
                         not have much, but what you got, you 
                         got a lot of. You could get any girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's only one I want.

               A beat.

                                     AMOS
                         Her name is Sandra Templeton. She's 
                         going to Auburn. The semester's almost 
                         over, so you better hurry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Thank you.

                                     AMOS
                         Good luck, kid.

               Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there 
               as soon as possible.

               Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot.

               EXT. BIG TOP - DAY

               Edward shakes Karl's giant hand. They hug.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After saying my goodbyes, I hopped 
                         three trains to get to Auburn that 
                         afternoon.

               EXT. AUBURN UNIVERSITY - DAY

               We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking 
               his head in the fountain.

               He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out 
               of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative 
               dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-
               open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG 
               WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't 
               see.

               Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the 
               woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's 
               effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight.

               He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, 
               nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on.

                                     EDWARD
                         You don't know me, but my name is 
                         Edward Bloom and I am in love with 
                         you. I've spent the last three years 
                         working to find out who you are. 
                         I've been shot and stabbed and 
                         trampled a few times, had my ribs 
                         broken twice, but it's all worth it 
                         to see you here, now, and to finally 
                         get to talk to you. Because I am 
                         destined to marry you. I knew that 
                         from the first moment I saw you at 
                         the circus. And I know it now more 
                         than ever.

               ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say 
               is...

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm sorry.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't need to apologize to me. I 
                         mean, I'm the luckiest person you're 
                         going to find today...

               She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, 
               we see a diamond.

                                     SANDRA
                         No I'm sorry, I... I'm engaged to be 
                         married.

               ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress 
               the reaction, put on a brave front.

                                     EDWARD
                         Oh.

                                     SANDRA
                         But you're wrong. I do know you, at 
                         least by reputation. Edward Bloom 
                         from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged 
                         to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He 
                         was a few years older than you.

                                                              FLASHCUTS TO:

               EXT. CREEPY OLD HOUSE - THE GATE - NIGHT

               Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward.

               VARIOUS H.S. ATHLETIC COMPETITIONS 93

               Recapping earlier football, baseball and basketball 
               highlights, we find Edward beats Don every time.

               THE STREET CORNER / ASHTON PARADE

               A smoking Don Price crushes his cigarette as Edward leaves 
               town.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT/INT. SORORITY HOUSE - THE DOORWAY

               Edward is dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster...

                                     EDWARD
                         Well. Congratulations. I'm sorry to 
                         have bothered you.

               He turns and walks down the front steps.

               She stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely 
               horrible for what's happened. But eventually she goes back 
               inside. We hear GIGGLES from inside as her sorority sisters 
               get to the bottom of this.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it. It's not funny. That poor 
                         boy.

               We LEAD Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Fate has a cruel way of circling 
                         around on you. After all this work 
                         to leave Ashton, the girl I loved 
                         was now engaged to one of its biggest 
                         jerks.

               He EXITS FRAME, leaving only the sorority house in the 
               background.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         There's a time when a man needs to 
                         fight, and a time when he needs to 
                         accept that his destiny is lost, 
                         that the ship has sailed, and that 
                         only a fool would continue.

               A beat. Edward steps back INTO FRAME, looking at the sorority 
               house.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         The truth is, I've always been a 
                         fool.

               We CIRCLE as he shouts:

                                     EDWARD
                         Sandra Templeton! I love you! And I 
                         am going to marry you!

               INT. SORORITY HOUSE FOYER - DAY

               Sandra and her SISTERS peer out through the curtains. Is 
               this guy crazy?

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               The tweedy ECONOMICS PROFESSOR continues his explanation. 
               Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention.

               He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it. 
               There's a TITTER from the STUDENTS, but he doesn't notice.

               A classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up. Written on the 
               projector is "I Love Sandra Templeton." She's horrified and 
               excited at the same time. The professor finally notices what's 
               written there.

               EXT. QUAD - DAY

               Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving. 
               We look up to the blue sky, where a giant sky-written heart 
               floats in the wind.

               INT. SANDRA'S BEDROOM - [THE NEXT] MORNING

               At her Sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the 
               second-story window to find the lawn filled with

               TEN THOUSAND DAFFODILS.

               Edward stands amid the sea of flowers. He's waited there six 
               hours.

               EXT. SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra walks out to him. She's smiling, confused, joyful and 
               scared. All down Greek Street, STUDENTS are coming out to 
               see the display.

                                     SANDRA
                         Daffodils?

                                     EDWARD
                         They're your favorite flower.

                                     SANDRA
                         How did you get so many?

                                     EDWARD
                         I called everywhere in five states 
                         and explained this was the only way 
                         I could get my wife to marry me.

               Out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. She wipes 
               it off.

                                     SANDRA
                         You don't even know me.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have the rest of my life to find 
                         out.

               From down the street...

                                     A MAN'S VOICE
                         Sandra!

                                     SANDRA
                         It's Don. Promise me you won't hurt 
                         him.

                                     EDWARD
                         If that's what you want, I swear to 
                         it.

               The adult DON PRICE arrives. He's 230 pounds of football-
               playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle. And he's 
               pissed.

               A gang of his BROTHERS walk behind him.

                                     DON PRICE
                         Bloom!

                                     EDWARD
                         Don.

                                     DON PRICE
                         What the hell are you doing? This is 
                         my girl. Mine!

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't know she belonged to anybody.

               Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right 
               back up, but makes no move to defend himself.

               Unfazed, Don slugs him again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Stop it!

                                     DON PRICE
                              (ignoring)
                         What the matter, Bloom? Too scared 
                         to fight back?

                                     EDWARD
                         I promised I wouldn't.

               A beat. Don shrugs, fine. Then proceeds to kick Edward's ass 
               nine ways to Sunday.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         While I took the beating of a 
                         lifetime, it was Don Price who was 
                         ultimately defeated.

               As the ass-whupping continues, we 

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               INT. FRATERNITY HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [FLASHFORWARD]

               Sitting on the can, Don Price pinches a loaf while reading 
               the new Playboy.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         All the physical activity had worsened 
                         a congenital valve defect. Put simply, 
                         his heart wasn't strong enough.

               Don Price squeezes down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. 
               Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on 
               the tile.

                                                              MATCH CUT TO:

               EXT. WITCH'S HOUSE / GATE - NIGHT [FLASHBACK]

               The same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected 
               in The Eye.

                                                         RETURNING BACK TO:

               EXT. THE SORORITY HOUSE - DAY

               The thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back 
               to his feet, ready to be knocked down again.

                                     SANDRA
                         Don!

               Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns.

               Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible 
               AHH! from her sisters, and an OHH! from Don's brothers.

                                     SANDRA
                         I will never marry you.

               A beat. Don stands stunned, his mind reeling.

               Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting 
               for the next punch. Where is it? What's going on?

                                     DON PRICE
                         What. You love this guy?

                                     SANDRA
                         He's almost a stranger and I prefer 
                         him to you. 

               She hands him the ring. Another beat, then Don storms off. 
               But not before decking Edward one last time.

               Sandra leans over Edward's broken body. His head lies on the 
               daffodils.

                                     SANDRA
                         How can I convince you to stop?

                                     EDWARD
                         Go out with me.

               He smiles, his teeth bloody.

                                     SANDRA
                         Okay.

               As the crowd of students APPLAUDS and CHEERS, we CRANE UP 
               above the flowered battlefield.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         As it turned out, Sandra was able to 
                         keep her same date at the chapel. 
                         Only the groom had changed.

               As the MUSIC reaches a crescendo, we suddenly...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT [PRESENT]

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I thought you said you didn't have a 
                         church wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         Well, we were all set to, but there 
                         was a complication.

               He reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has 
               it for him. She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire 
               glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, we...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT [CONTINUOUS]

               Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the 
               stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom.

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Is it the medicine that's making you 
                         thirsty?

                                     EDWARD (O.S.)
                         Truth is, I've been thirsty my whole 
                         life. Never really known why.

               Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but 
               not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few 
               inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife.

               INTERCUT HALLWAY / BEDROOM

                                     EDWARD
                         There was one time when I was 
                         eleven...

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (gently)
                         You were talking about your wedding.

                                     EDWARD
                         I didn't forget. I was just working 
                         on a tangent. See, most men, they'll 
                         tell a story straight through, and 
                         it won't be complicated, but it won't 
                         be interesting either.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I like your stories.

                                     EDWARD
                         And I like you.

               He doesn't let the moment linger with undue sentimentality. 
               There's a story to be told.

                                     EDWARD
                         Now. The thing about working for a 
                         circus is you don't have a regular 
                         address, and after three years I had 
                         a lot of undelivered mail.

               In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself 
               listen to the story one more time.

                                     EDWARD
                         During the four weeks I was in the 
                         hospital, the postmaster finally 
                         caught up with me.

               INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

               Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail 
               with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking 
               letter. Reading it, his face drops.

               FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out that while my heart 
                         belonged to Sandra, the rest of my 
                         body belonged to the U.S. Government.

               INT. ARMY AIRPLANE - NIGHT

               With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a 
               dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, 
               but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         A hitch in the Army was up to three 
                         years at that point, and having waited 
                         three years just to meet Sandra, I 
                         knew I couldn't survive being away 
                         from her that long. So I took every 
                         hazardous assignment I could find, 
                         with the hope of getting my time 
                         down to less than a year.

               The JUMP LEADER yells...

                                     JUMP LEADER
                         GO! GO! GO!

               One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main 
               line. When his time comes, Edward leaps...

               ...but he's stuck. His cord is caught up in the assembly.

               He twists and struggles, trying to free himself. Looking 
               down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the 
               darkness. They're already long gone.

               Digging a knife out of his pocket, Edward gets to work cutting 
               through the cable. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the 
               plane.

               EXT. OUTSIDE STAGE - NIGHT

               A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the 
               equivalent of a U.S.O. show.

               A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. 
               We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every 
               act is fundamentally the same.

               The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's 
               finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. 
               The Emcee makes a "shoot him in the neck" motion to one of 
               the ARMED GUARDS off-stage.

               EXT. HIGH ABOVE THE STAGE - NIGHT

               We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. 
               He can't steer. He's helpless.

               But then, a BLAST of fireworks from the sides of the stage. 
               The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. It's just enough 
               cover for Edward to remain unseen.

               He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. 
               He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the 
               curtain goes up. Edward looks out at the sea of excited 
               soldiers. Every one of them would kill him. He's the legless 
               cricket left on the anthill.

               EXT. ON STAGE

               The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's 
               as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see.

               She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a 
               knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their 
               feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING.

               UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. 
               The two men begin to SCUFFLE.

               MUSIC starts, a vampy torch song. Ping sings melody while an 
               off-stage voice carries perfect harmony.

                                     PING
                         Sometimes a girl can feel so alone 
                         Without a lover to call her own. 
                         Sometimes it's so bad, she wants to 
                         explode. 
                         Wants to grab the first man she sees 
                         and tear off his clothes.

               A ROAR from the soldiers. She knows what they want.

               Still fighting, Edward jumps for a pole on the far side of 
               the catwalk, sliding down it to end up

               BACKSTAGE.

               His determined opponent follows him down.

                                     PING (CONT'D)
                         But she won't.
                         No, she can't. 
                         She needs a special special different 
                         unusual man. 
                         Because that girl, 
                         Who looks like me, 
                         She has wants, but she has needs.

                                     PING
                              (speaking)
                         Any of you got needs?

               The soldiers ROAR LOUDER, STOMPING on the bleachers.

               Backstage, the two men are still fighting.

                                     PING
                              (chorus)
                         I've had twice the adventure, 
                         Cried double the tears. 
                         Two times the bad times in half the 
                         years. 
                         I need a strong man, because I've 
                         got 
                         Twice the love to give.

               For the first time, Ping turns, and now we see why she was 
               standing in profile. Ping is one-half of

               SIAMESE TWINS.

               Her identical twin is JING, who's been singing harmony all 
               this time. They are two separate women who join at the waist, 
               one set of perfect legs beneath them.

               Edward sees the twins from behind, does a double-take. It 
               costs him a punch to the jaw.

                                     PING
                         Say hello, Jing.

                                     JING
                         Hello Jing.

                                     PING
                              (to the crowd)
                         I'm Ping. She's Jing. She's the good 
                         one.
                              (closer)
                         I'm the bad one.

               As the MUSIC builds towards the climax, Edward finishes the 
               fight, knocking the guard out with a right hook.

               As Ping and Jing reach the last chorus, they strike a final 
               pose in the shape of a heart, their arms forming the arches, 
               their backs forming the curves.

               Edward slips behind curtains, trying to get away.

               The soldiers are SHOUTING for an encore, lighters waving. 
               The curtain slowly lowers, revealing

               EDWARD'S PARACHUTE.

               The APPLAUSE dies, replaced by a concerned RUMBLE. The Emcee 
               yells for the Guards to search.

               ON STAGE

               Ping has no idea what's happening. Jing reaches into her 
               cleavage to pull out her eyeglasses.

               INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

               As ARMED GUARDS search the halls below the stage, Ping and 
               Jing shut the door to their dressing room. At the closet, 
               they start to change outfits. Off-stage, their personalities 
               become quite apparent: Ping is brash, bitchy and ambitious, 
               while Jing is quiet, sweet and bookish.

               In Chinese, subtitled...

                                     PING
                         How could you miss your cue? You 
                         make me look like a fool, out there 
                         alone.

                                     JING
                         You weren't alone.

               Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister.

               Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, 
               exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to 
               look.

                                     PING
                         Who the hell are you?

                                     EDWARD
                              (in Chinese)
                         I'm not going to hurt you.

                                     PING
                         Damn right you're not.
                              (yelling)
                         GUARD!

               Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A 
               rifle-toting GUARD looks in.

               Pretending to be her bitchy sister --

                                     JING
                         Tell your men not to bother us! And 
                         lock that door!

               The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Desperately 
               flipping through his Asian phrasebook, he finds...

                                     EDWARD
                         Please, I need your help.

                                     PING
                         What makes you think we'll help you?

               Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. It's Sandra.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               VARIOUS SHOTS

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Over the next hour, I described my 
                         love for Sandra Kay Templeton, and 
                         the ordeal that brought me before 
                         them. As it had always been, this 
                         love was my salvation. It was destined 
                         to be.

               Hearing the story, Jing wipes away a tear. Even Ping is a 
               little affected.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         We put together an elaborate plan 
                         for escape, involving a whaling ship 
                         to Russia, a barge to Cuba and a 
                         small, dirty canoe to Miami. We all 
                         knew it would be dangerous.

               Still subtitled:

                                     PING
                         And what are we supposed to do when 
                         we get to America?

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get you bookings. I know the 
                         biggest man in show business.

                                     JING
                         Bob Hope?

                                     EDWARD
                         Bigger.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. TEMPLETON FAMILY HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so the twins and I began our 
                         arduous journey halfway around the 
                         world. Unfortunately, there was no 
                         way to send a message back to America.

               A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And so it was no surprise that the 
                         Army believed I was dead.

               Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. The pain of her shout 
               makes church bells RING.

               EXT. BEHIND THE TEMPLETON HOUSE - DAY

               Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a 
               tunnel of fabric.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After four months, Sandra had gotten 
                         over the worst of the nightmares. 
                         When the phone rang, she didn't think 
                         it was somehow me calling her. When 
                         a car drove past, she didn't get up 
                         to check out the window.

               Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see

               A MAN'S SILHOUETTE

               on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow 
               ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the 
               breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead.

               She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she 
               hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket.

               Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing 
               before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. 
               It is destiny.

               Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               BRIGHT SUNLIGHT

               filters through soft sheets. We're under the covers, where a 
               man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, 
               then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be

               JOSEPHINE.

               She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. 
               He's been up for a while. We are actually...

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               ...where the couple stays cocooned under the sheets, a kind 
               of limbo. A kiss good morning. Legs entangling. Neither wants 
               to get up.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I talked with your father last night.

                                     WILL
                         Did you?

               A look to say, should I be worried?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You never told me how your parents 
                         met.

                                     WILL
                         They met at Auburn.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         What about the details? How they 
                         fell in love. The Circus. The War. 
                         You never told me any of that.

                                     WILL
                         That's because most of it never 
                         happened.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's romantic.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                              (non-committal)
                         Mmm.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Mmm, what?

                                     WILL
                         Mmm, what. I know better than to 
                         argue romance with a French woman.

               He moves his head out from under the sheet. She follows him 
               to the "outside."

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Do you love your father?

                                     WILL
                         Everyone loves my father. He's a 
                         very likeable guy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                              (repeating)
                         Do you love him?

               Will doesn't want to answer yes or no.

                                     WILL
                         You have to understand. When I was 
                         growing up, he was gone more than he 
                         was here. And I started thinking -- 
                         maybe he has a second life somewhere 
                         else. With another house, another 
                         family. He leaves us, he goes to 
                         them. Or maybe there is no family. 
                         Maybe he never wanted a family. But 
                         whatever it is, maybe he likes that 
                         second life better. And the reason 
                         he tells all those stories is because 
                         he can't stand this boring place.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         But it's not true.

                                     WILL
                         What is "true?" I've never heard my 
                         father say a single true thing.

               Off her silence...

                                     WILL
                         Look, I know why you like him. I 
                         know why everyone likes him. But I 
                         need you to tell me I'm not crazy.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         You're not.

                                     WILL
                         I need you on my side.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I am always on your side. And I think 
                         you should talk to him.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               The family finishes eating breakfast off TV trays set up 
               around the bed. For his part, Edward is looking better. 
               Certainly not recovered, but there's an optimism to his 
               expression. And for the first time, he's actually hungry.

               He watches as Sandra puts the cap back on the syrup.

                                     EDWARD
                         Did I ever tell you about how...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes.

               Edward is startled.

                                     WILL
                         The maple tree and the Buick. We 
                         heard it.

                                     EDWARD
                              (re: Josephine)
                         I think someone hasn't.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         The tree fell on the car, spilling 
                         the syrup, which attracted the flies, 
                         which got stuck to it and flew off 
                         with the whole car.

               A beat.

                                     EDWARD
                              (undeterred)
                         But the real story is how I got the 
                         car. You see...

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Son?

                                     WILL
                         Can we talk?

               Sandra SNAPS the cap back on the syrup.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to get started on dishes.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'll help you.

               Both women quickly gather plates.

               Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to 
               happen. It settles for a beat after they leave.

                                     WILL
                         Do you know much about icebergs, 
                         Dad?

                                     EDWARD
                         Do I? I saw an iceberg once. They 
                         were hauling it down to Texas for 
                         drinking water, only they didn't 
                         count on an elephant being frozen 
                         inside. The woolly kind. A mammoth.

                                     WILL
                              (interrupting)
                         Dad!

                                     EDWARD
                         What?

                                     WILL
                         I'm trying to make a metaphor here.

                                     EDWARD
                         Then you shouldn't have started with 
                         a question. Because people want to 
                         answer questions. You should have 
                         started with, "The thing about 
                         icebergs is..."

                                     WILL
                              (frustrated)
                         The thing about icebergs is you only 
                         see 10 percent of them. The other 90 
                         percent is below the water where you 
                         can't see it. And that's what it is 
                         with you Dad. I'm only seeing this 
                         little bit that sticks above the 
                         water.

                                     EDWARD
                              (joking)
                         What, you're seeing down to my nose? 
                         My chin?

                                     WILL
                         I have no idea who you are because 
                         you have never told me a single fact.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've told you a thousand facts. That's 
                         all I do, Will. I tell stories.

                                     WILL
                         You tell lies, Dad. You tell amusing 
                         lies. Stories are what you tell a 
                         five-year old at bedtime. They're 
                         not elaborate mythologies you maintain 
                         when your son is ten and fifteen and 
                         twenty and thirty. And the thing is, 
                         I believed you. I believed your 
                         stories so much longer than I should 
                         have. And then when I realized that 
                         everything you said was impossible -- 
                         everything! -- I felt like such a 
                         fool to have trusted you. You were 
                         like Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny 
                         combined. Just as charming and just 
                         as fake.

                                     EDWARD
                         You think I'm fake.

                                     WILL
                         Only on the surface. But that's all 
                         I've ever seen.

               Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving.

                                     WILL
                         Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my 
                         own here. It would kill me if he 
                         went through his whole life never 
                         understanding me.

                                     EDWARD
                         It would kill you, huh?

               Finally --

                                     EDWARD
                         What do you want, Will? Who do you 
                         want me to be?

                                     WILL
                         Yourself. Good, bad, everything. 
                         Just show me who you are for once.

                                     EDWARD
                         I have been nothing but myself since 
                         the day I was born. And if you can't 
                         see that, it's your failing, not 
                         mine.

               EXT. BACKYARD - DAY

               With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out 
               of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long 
               since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, 
               slime covering the cemented rocks.

               Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's 
               surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which 
               disappears into the murky water.

               A beat. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. He 
               casually walks away.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring 
               into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of 
               hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built 
               outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian 
               lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to 
               sell.

               Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its 
               ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit 
               beside it.

                                     SANDRA
                         Your father decided he needed to 
                         have an office, and it wouldn't do 
                         to have it in the house. You'll know 
                         better than me what's important.

               With some effort, Will forces up the desktop. With a HISS, a 
               neighbor's cat makes a run for it. Will's getting used to 
               being startled.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY [LATER]

               Will, Sandra and Josephine have worked through two trash 
               bags of papers to throw out. Looking through a new file, 
               Sandra makes a small sound. A memory.

                                     WILL
                         What is it?

               Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. He shares it with 
               Josephine.

                                     SANDRA
                         It was during the war. Your father 
                         went missing. They thought he was 
                         dead.

               Will can't believe what he's reading.

                                     WILL
                         That really happened?

                                     SANDRA
                         Not everything your father says is a 
                         complete fabrication.

               A beat, then Sandra stands.

                                     SANDRA
                         I'm going to check on him.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I need to lie down for a bit.

                                     WILL
                         Go.

               Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the 
               telegram, still bewildered.

               Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange 
               mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically.

               Will smiles, a memory. He hasn't thought about this device 
               in years. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the 
               hand.

               Edward's VOICE begins as a memory...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         After the war, the sons of Alabama 
                         returned home, looking for work. 
                         Each had an advantage over me. They 
                         were alive, while I was -- officially -- 
                         deceased.

               INT. DOWNTOWN OFFICE - DAY [STORY]

               Edward shakes hands with his new boss, a TOUPEED MAN. The 
               company is called "Confederated Products." The OFFICE LADIES 
               all love Edward.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         With my prospects few, I took a job 
                         as a travelling salesman. It suited 
                         me. If there's one thing you can say 
                         about Edward Bloom, it's that I am a 
                         social person.

               EXT. COUNTY FAIR - DAY [STORY]

               On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to 
               the crowd.

                                     EDWARD
                         I've travelled from Tennessee to 
                         Timbuktu, and if there's one thing 
                         people have in common, is we could 
                         all use a hand around the house.

               Edward sets down a contraption, which looks something like a 
               metal lava lamp. Like a flower, it unfolds to reveal five 
               fingers and a thumb. This is the Hand Around the House.(TM)

                                     EDWARD
                         Why, with this product you can...

               QUICK MONTAGE as he demonstrates:

                                     EDWARD
                         Open a jar. Open a letter. Scratch 
                         yourself while wearing mittens. Hold 
                         a book. Hold a baby. Hold the dog 
                         away from kittens. It's strong enough, 
                         you can do a handstand with no hands 
                         at all.

               Indeed, a remarkably agile Edward is able to support his 
               entire weight on it. The crowd APPLAUDS.

                                     EDWARD
                         You can use it to point out important 
                         information. Or dangers. Or beautiful 
                         women.

               The hand points a finger at an HEAVYSET MAN IN OVERALLS.

                                     EDWARD
                         We're still working on that one.

               The crowd LAUGHS.

               EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

               Edward drives, his hand out in the wind.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Soon I added other products, and 
                         other cities, until my territory 
                         stretched from the coast to western 
                         Texas.

               EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY

               Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as 
               ever.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I could be gone for weeks at a time. 
                         But every other Friday, I'd put all 
                         the money I'd made into an account 
                         set aside for a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               EXT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               Establishing this Texas institution, we come...

               INT. HORIZON SAVINGS & LOAN - DAY

               The bank is busy with the lunch-hour crowd. Taking his place 
               in line, Edward fills out a deposit slip.

               As the line snakes around through the ropes, the man in front 
               of him gets a look at Edward.

                                     THE MAN
                         Edward? Edward Bloom?

               The man is none other than...

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         It's me. Norther Winslow.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I was astonished to see the greatest 
                         poet of both Ashton and Spectre all 
                         the way out in Texas.

               The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence.

                                     EDWARD
                         I don't believe it!

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I want you to know, when you left 
                         Spectre it opened my eyes. There was 
                         a whole life out there that I was 
                         not living. So I travelled. I saw 
                         France, and Africa, half of South 
                         America. Every day a new adventure, 
                         that's my motto.

                                     EDWARD
                         That's great, Norther. I'm happy for 
                         you. I can't believe I helped.

               He's genuinely proud.

                                     EDWARD
                         So what are you up to now?

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I'm robbing this place.

               Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols 
               out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling.

               SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a 
               halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. 
               The guard takes out his gun and slides it over.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to Edward)
                         Would you mind grabbing that?

               There's nothing threatening about his delivery -- he might 
               as well be asking for a Budweiser. Still, Edward senses it 
               would be best to do as he says. He takes the guard's gun.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                              (to the crowd)
                         Now, I want all of you to lie down. 
                         I'm gonna be cleaning out the cash 
                         drawers, and my associate here is 
                         going to handle the vault. 
                              (pointing to a Teller 
                              Woman)
                         You help my friend, okay?

               The TELLER WOMAN nods.

               ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he 
               truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is 
               already waving him to the back.

               He decides he better go.

               INT. AT THE VAULT - DAY

               The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. 
               Edward feels horrible.

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I'm really sorry. I just don't 
                         want anybody to get hurt.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         It's not that, it's just...

               She pulls open the vault door.

               INT. THE VAULT - DAY

               The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds 
               exactly one folding chair. Nothing else.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                         ...there's no money. We're completely 
                         bankrupt.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         It turned out the savings and loan 
                         had already been robbed -- not by 
                         armed bandits, but by speculators in 
                         Texas real estate.

                                     TELLER WOMAN
                              (dead serious)
                         You gotta promise you won't tell 
                         anybody.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - DAY

               Edward drives the getaway car, though truthfully they're 
               going just a little over the speed limit. No one's following 
               them. It's an empty country road for miles.

               Norther HOLLERS with body-tingling joy as he counts the money.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Sixty. Eighty. Four hundred dollars! 
                         Not bad for just the drawers. Let's 
                         see what you got from the vault.

               Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. Digging through 
               the vault bag, Norther is surprised to find only a single 
               deposit envelope. He rips it open, revealing just a little 
               cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         This is it? The whole vault.

                                     EDWARD
                         'Fraid so.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, it's got your deposit slip 
                         on it.

               Caught, Edward has to confess...

                                     EDWARD
                         Look, I just didn't want you to go 
                         empty-handed. There's something you 
                         should know, Norther. You see, the 
                         reason why...

               Edward continues his narration...

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I told Norther about the vagaries of 
                         Texas oil money and its effect on 
                         real estate prices, and how lax 
                         enforcement of fiduciary process had 
                         made savings and loans particularly 
                         vulnerable.

               Hearing this news, Norther was left with one conclusion:

               EXT. TEXAS ROAD - DAY

               Norther leans in the driver's side window.

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         I should go to Wall Street. That's 
                         where all the money is.

               Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         I knew then that while my days as a 
                         criminal were over, Norther's were 
                         just beginning.

               The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the 
               last moment, Norther calls out:

                                     NORTHER WINSLOW
                         Edward, thank you for the hand!

               He's talking about his Hand Around the House. We HOLD ON 
               Norther for a beat, dreaming of his future.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         When Norther made his first million 
                         dollars, he sent me a check for ten 
                         thousand. I protested, but he said 
                         it was my fee as his career advisor.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE [MID/LATE '70'S] - DAY

               Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to 
               greet Edward, just returned from another trip.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         Ten thousand dollars is no fortune 
                         to most men. But it was enough to 
                         buy my wife a proper house with a 
                         white picket fence.

               We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. 
               Edward kisses his wife.

                                     EDWARD (V.O.)
                         And for that, it was all the riches 
                         a man could ever want.

               Sandra drops the hose, letting it run on the lawn.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE BATHROOM - DAY [PRESENT]

               CLOSE ON Edward's hand as he turns knobs.

               CLOSE ON water SPLASHING into the claw-foot bathtub, which 
               begins to fill.

               Still wearing his pajamas, Edward climbs into the tub. 
               Carefully lowers himself.

               As the water reaches the third button up on his pajama shirt, 
               Edward suddenly slides

               UNDERWATER.

               Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's 
               quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the 
               spigot. Edward's eyes are closed.

               A long beat. Another. Then the SPLASHING water goes silent. 
               Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find

               SANDRA

               sitting on the edge of the tub. She doesn't seem particularly 
               worried -- her husband has always done this.

                                     EDWARD
                         I was drying out.

                                     SANDRA
                         I see. We need to get you one of 
                         those plant misters. We can spray 
                         you like a fern.

               He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in 
               the tub. A beat while she considers.

               Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, 
               facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind.

               He leans forward and kisses her. When they separate, she has 
               tears hanging in her eyes.

                                     EDWARD
                         Come now.

               He wipes them away.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't think I'll ever dry out.

               INT. BASEMENT STORAGE AREA - DAY

               Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another 
               file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but 
               usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash.

               He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. 
               Something doesn't make sense.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE / STAIRS - DAY

               Will is headed upstairs when his mother comes around the 
               corner with an armful of laundry, including her wet dress.

                                     WILL
                         Is he awake?

                                     SANDRA
                         He just fell asleep. Josephine's 
                         with him.

               She passes him. He turns.

                                     WILL
                         Mom?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes?

               Will quickly debates whether or not to ask her...

                                     WILL
                         Did you and Dad have any other 
                         property?

                                     SANDRA
                              (thinking)
                         I suppose your grandmother's house 
                         when she passed on. But we sold that 
                         right away. Your cousin Shirley bought 
                         it.

                                     WILL
                         So you never bought any land.

                                     SANDRA
                         Heavens no. We had a hard enough 
                         time keeping the mortgage on this 
                         place.

               Will nods, just curious. He continues heading up.

               INT. WILL AND JOSEPHINE'S ROOM - DAY

               Will changes his shirt. Takes his keys off the nightstand.

               EXT. COUNTY ROAD - DAY

               Will's rental car drives past a sign reading, "Ashton, 10 
               miles."

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will checks the address on one of his father's files.

               EXT. ASHTON GAS - DAY

               Will talks to the ATTENDANT, who points him in a direction, 
               then gestures a series of left, right, left, rights.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Will drives down a road that seems somewhat familiar. And 
               then we realize why: a roadsign reads "Welcome to Spectre!"

               EXT. A LONE HOUSE - DAY

               Sitting at the edge of a swamp, the little two-story feels 
               lonely, set deep in its lot. Dapples of light break through 
               the trees, a light breeze swaying the branches.

               As Will walks from the car, the WHIRR of cicadas grows. He 
               checks the number: 33. This is the house. It is surrounded 
               by a white square-picket fence, identical to his mother's. 
               Will notices this.

               Reaching the porch, we hear a PIANO playing inside. Badly.

               Re-checking the number on a form he's carrying, Will KNOCKS. 
               The piano stops.

                                     WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                         Go back to the start. Right hand 
                         only.

               The piano starts again. FOOTSTEPS.

               The door opens to reveal a blonde woman in her 50's -- the 
               woman from the grocery store. Her name is Jenny Hill.

               She and Will are startled to see each other.

                                     JENNY
                         Oh. Oh.

                                     WILL
                         Hello.

                                     JENNY
                         I wasn't expecting you.

               Confused, Will checks the name on the form.

                                     WILL
                         Are you Jenny Hill?

                                     JENNY
                         I am. And you're Will. I've seen 
                         your picture, that's how I recognize 
                         you. I almost said something at the 
                         store, but it would have been awkward.
                              (a beat)
                         Like this.

               The PIANO STUDENT, a black boy of eight, has stopped. He's 
               watching the conversation at the door. Speaking of awkward...

                                     JENNY
                              (to the student)
                         Listen, Kenny. Why don't we skip the 
                         lesson today? We can go again next 
                         week.

               She hands him five dollars out of her pocket.

                                     STUDENT
                         Do I have to give it back to my Mom?

                                     JENNY
                         I won't tell her if you won't.

               You don't have to tell him twice. He's out the door in a 
               flash.

               INT. JENNY'S KITCHEN - DAY

               While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she 
               never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will.

                                     WILL
                         How did you know my father?

                                     JENNY
                         This was on his sales route, so he 
                         was through here all the time. 
                         Everyone in town knew him.

               A beat. Not flinching...

                                     WILL
                         Were you and my father having an 
                         affair?

                                     JENNY
                              (taken aback)
                         Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was 
                         expecting to dance around this for 
                         another half hour.

                                     WILL
                         I've seen him with women. He flirts. 
                         He always has. On some level, I 
                         presumed he was cheating on my mother. 
                         I just never had proof.

               She moves, trying to get out of the corner he's boxed her 
               into. Once she's finally free...

                                     JENNY
                         Can I ask you a question? Why did 
                         you come here today? If you found 
                         this deed, why didn't you just ask 
                         Eddie?

                                     WILL
                         Because he's dying.

               A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. 
               She's a tangle of conflicting emotions.

                                     JENNY
                         Look, I don't know how much you want 
                         to know about any of this. You have 
                         one image of your father and it would 
                         be wrong for me to go and change it. 
                         Especially this late in the game.

                                     WILL
                         My father talked about a lot of things 
                         he never did, and I'm sure he did a 
                         lot of things he never talked about. 
                         I'm just trying to reconcile the 
                         two.

               Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.

                                     JENNY
                         The first thing you have to 
                         understand, is that your father never 
                         meant to end up here. And yet he 
                         did, twice. The first time, he was 
                         early. The second time, he was late.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR / DRIVING - NIGHT

               It's late, and Edward is pensive.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Those days, your father was working 
                         for himself. If there was one thing 
                         you could say about Edward Bloom, 
                         it's that he was a social person, 
                         and people took a liking to him. One 
                         night he was returning from three 
                         weeks on the road, when he hit a 
                         thunderstorm unlike any in his life.

               The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the 
               wipers.

               INT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT - [THE STORM]

               Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's not even rain anymore -- 
               there's no space between the drops. It's like being caught 
               in a waterfall. It's that loud.

               No choice, Edward stops the car. Puts on the handbrake. Just 
               as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but 
               softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because --

               EXT. EDWARD'S CAR - NIGHT

               -- the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, 
               but where there used to be air is water.

               Three catfish swim in front of his headlights.

               INT. THE CAR - NIGHT

               Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is 
               trickling in through the crack between the window and the 
               door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine.

               That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River.

               She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face 
               exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, 
               as the first time we saw her.

               She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet 
               hers. And smiles.

                                                              FLASH CUT TO:

               EXT. FIELD BY DIRT ROAD - DAY

               It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees 
               drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain.

               Edward gathers the clothes that have spilled out of his 
               suitcase, which broke open when he dropped it from

               HIS CAR,

               which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. As 
               Edward gathers his last pair of socks, he notices a shiny 
               piece of metal sticking out of the dirt. He pulls it out, 
               rubs it off.

               It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Fate has a way of circling back on a 
                         man, and taking him by surprise.

               EXT. ROAD - DAY

               Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a 
               one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign...

                                  "Welcome to Spectre."

               EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

               Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the 
               road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to 
               find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, 
               along with the rest of the town's.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A man sees things differently at 
                         different times in his life. This 
                         town didn't seem the same now that 
                         he was older.

               EXT. TOWN OF SPECTRE - VARIOUS SHOTS

               We look around the town, on and off Main Street. There are 
               "FOR SALE" signs in many of the windows

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         A new road had brought the outside 
                         world to Spectre, and with it, banks, 
                         liens and debt. Almost everywhere 
                         you looked, people were bankrupt.

               EXT. SPECTRE - DAY

               We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward 
               watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among 
               the bidders.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Two different corporations were 
                         looking at buying the town, if they 
                         could get the price low enough. One 
                         wanted to open a chicken processing 
                         plant. The other, a municipal dump. 
                         Either way, Spectre would be 
                         destroyed.

               Edward raises his hand.

                                     EDWARD
                         Fifty-thousand!

               Everyone turns to look at this new bidder.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And so Edward Bloom decided to buy 
                         the town, in order to save it.

               INT. NORTHER WINSLOW'S MANHATTAN - DAY

               Edward pitches his plan to Norther.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         He was never a wealthy man, but he 
                         had made other men rich, and now he 
                         asked for their favors.

               INT./EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAY

               VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward 
               talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most of them had never seen Spectre -- 
                         they only had Edward's words to 
                         describe it. That's all they needed. 
                         He sold them on the dream.

                                     JING
                         You can structure it as a historical 
                         trust. But you'll need every 
                         contiguous piece of property. It's 
                         all or nothing.

               As Edward takes notes...

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         So first he bought the farms. Then 
                         he bought the houses. Then he bought 
                         the stores.

               INT. AL'S COUNTRY - DAY

               Finishing up with AL, Edward shakes hands.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Whatever he bought, the people were 
                         not asked to leave or pay rent or 
                         anything. They were just asked to 
                         keep doing as they were doing. In 
                         that way, he could make sure the 
                         town would never die.

               EXT. ROAD IN THE SWAMP - DAY

               Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally 
               stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the 
               trees' thick canopy.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Within six months, his trust had 
                         purchased the entire town. With one 
                         exception.

               In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. 
               He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around 
               his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers.

               We hear a PIANO playing from inside the shack. Edward KNOCKS 
               on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself.

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. A fire 
               burns in the stove, and curtains hang in the windows.

               With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. 
               Edward doesn't recognize her as the little girl who used to 
               have a crush on him. Without turning, she says...

                                     JENNY
                         You must be Edward Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         How did you know?

               She keeps PLAYING.

                                     JENNY
                         No one would come out here unless 
                         they had business. And no one would 
                         have business with me except for 
                         you. You're buying the town.

                                     EDWARD
                         Apparently I've overlooked this one 
                         piece of it, and I'd like to remedy 
                         that. You see, in order for the town 
                         to be preserved, the trust must own 
                         it in its entirety.

                                     JENNY
                         So I've heard.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll offer you more than it's worth. 
                         And you know you won't have to move. 
                         Nothing will change except the name 
                         on the deed, you have my word.

               Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns 
               to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her.

                                     JENNY
                         Now let me get this straight. You'll 
                         buy the swamp from me, but I'll stay 
                         in it. You'll own the house, but 
                         it'll still be mine. I'll be here, 
                         and you'll come and go as you please 
                         to one place or another. Do I have 
                         that right?

               Strange to hear it put that way, but --

                                     EDWARD
                         In so many words, yes.

                                     JENNY
                         Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If 
                         nothing is going to change, I'd just 
                         as soon it not change in the way it 
                         hasn't been changing all this time.

                                     EDWARD
                         It's not like you're going to lose 
                         anything. You can ask anyone in town. 
                         I've been nothing if not generous. I 
                         want the best for everyone.

               A long beat.

                                     JENNY
                         Mr. Bloom, why are you buying this 
                         land? Some sort of midlife crisis? 
                         Instead of buying a convertible, you 
                         buy a town?

               He looks at her, puzzled and surprised. No one has really 
               asked before.

                                     EDWARD
                         Helping people makes me happy.

                                     JENNY
                         I'm not convinced you should be happy.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry. Have I offended you?

               She finally turns to face him.

                                     JENNY
                         No, you did exactly what you promised. 
                         You came back. I was just expecting 
                         you sooner.

                                                              FLASHBACK TO:

               EXT. SPECTRE - NIGHT

               Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for 
               the first time.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. SHACK - DAY

               Finally realizing who this woman is...

                                     EDWARD
                         You're Beamen's daughter. Your last 
                         name is different.
                              (realizing)
                         You married.

                                     JENNY
                         I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that 
                         was a big difference.

               Before he can say anything more...

                                     JENNY
                         I won't be selling you this house, 
                         Mr. Bloom.

                                     EDWARD
                         I see. I thank you for your time.

               A bit bewildered, Edward tips his hat to her as he leaves.

               EXT/INT. SWAMP SHACK - DAY

               Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it 
               breaks off in his hands. It's not the clean exit he was hoping 
               for.

               Inside Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed.

               Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they 
               SNAP off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack CREAKS.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry.

               He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps 
               slipping.

                                     JENNY
                         It's okay, just leave it.

                                     EDWARD
                         I can get it. I can just...

               He leans the door a different way. It holds for a beat then 
               falls in, SMASHING a small table.

                                     EDWARD
                         Lord, I'm sorry I...

                                     JENNY
                         Please. Go. Just go.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'll...

                                     JENNY
                         Go.

               She's dead serious. Weighing the scales of chivalry, he 
               finally backs away. Turns and heads back towards his car.

               We STAY ON Jenny, watching him go. She's furious, but there's 
               something more in her feelings for him. Something softer.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         Most men in that situation would 
                         accept their failure and move on. 
                         But Edward was not like most men.

               EXT. SWAMP SHACK ROAD - ANOTHER DAY

               With Karl the Giant's help, Edward unloads a brand new door 
               from a pickup truck.

               EXT. SHACK - DAY

               While Jenny watches, half-annoyed, half-amused, Edward tries 
               to set the door square. Karl pushes against the side of the 
               house until it fits.

               INT. SHACK - ANOTHER DAY

               Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows 
               himself. Jenny is making soup, laughing at the story he's 
               telling.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As the months passed, he found more 
                         and more things to fix, until the 
                         shack no longer resembled itself.

               EXT. SWAMP - ANOTHER DAY

               Edward and Karl cut down a tree, letting in a flood of light.

               Through the golden pollen hanging in the air, we RISE UP to 
               see the shack is now

               THE LOVELY HOUSE

               we saw before. It's tiny and white, with black shutters and 
               a steep roof. A white picket fence. In every detail it is 
               impossibly charming.

               INT. JENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

               Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer. 
               Jenny leans against the doorframe listening to his story. 
               And watching him with deepest affection.

                                     EDWARD
                         Of course, the best part was creating 
                         new material. By the time the twins 
                         and I got to Havana, we had a whole 
                         new routine worked out for them, 
                         with just a ukulele and a harmonica.

               Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and 
               hangs it on the rack. Perfect.

               A beat. A look between them. With that last job done, there's 
               no reason for him to be staying any longer.

                                     EDWARD
                         I suppose I should...

               He takes his hat off the rack.

                                     JENNY
                         You can leave it there.

               A beat. Does she really mean it?

               She comes closer. Edward holds his ground. She takes his 
               hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close -- 
               just a half-inch from kissing him when --

               -- Edward gently holds her back.

                                     EDWARD
                         No.

               She freezes, stunned and humiliated. She pulls away.

                                     EDWARD
                         Don't. Don't be embarrassed. I should 
                         never have let you think that...
                              (beat)
                         I am in love with my wife.

                                     JENNY
                         I know.

                                     EDWARD
                         And from the moment I saw her until 
                         the moment I die, she's the only 
                         one.

                                     JENNY
                         Lucky girl.

                                     EDWARD
                         I'm sorry, Jenny. I am.

               With that, he begins to leaves.

                                     JENNY
                         Wait! Edward!

               She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house. 
               Hands it to him. With a look, he thanks her. Then goes.

               EXT. SPECTRE - MAGIC HOUR

               Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         One day, Edward Bloom left, and never 
                         returned to the town he'd saved.

               He climbs in his car and starts the engine.

               EXT. JENNY HILL'S HOUSE - DAY TO NIGHT

               As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, 
               swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches.

               Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes 
               slither through the marsh.

               Day becomes night.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         As for the girl, the common belief 
                         was that she'd become a witch, and 
                         crazy at that. She became something 
                         of a legend herself.

               We REVERSE to find FOUR KIDS looking in through the rusty 
               iron gate with flashlights. A beat, then they run away.

                                     JENNY (V.O.)
                         And the story ended where it began.

               INT. JENNY HILL'S KITCHEN - PRESENT DAY

               Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of 
               iced tea between them.

                                     WILL
                         Logically, you couldn't be the Witch, 
                         because she was old back when he was 
                         young.

                                     JENNY
                         No, it's logical if you think like 
                         your father. See, to him, there's 
                         only two women: your mother and 
                         everyone else.

                                     WILL
                         You didn't become crazy.

                                     JENNY
                         Well, therapy. And one day I realized 
                         I was in love with a man who could 
                         never love me back. I was living in 
                         a fairy tale.

               Will smiles to hear it called that.

                                     JENNY
                         People aren't like they are in 
                         stories. They hurt each other without 
                         meaning to. They are kind and 
                         unbelievably cruel at the same moment. 
                         Like me, now. I'm not sure I should 
                         have told you any of this.

               Her composure is starting to break.

                                     WILL
                         No, I wanted to know. I'm glad I 
                         know.

               A long beat, both staring at their iced tea. Jenny is working 
               herself into more of a state by not talking.

                                     JENNY
                         I wanted to meet you for the longest 
                         time. I did.
                              (a smile)
                         I envied you so much. The way Eddie 
                         would talk about you when you were 
                         at Missouri, that award you won. 
                         Congratulations, incidentally. And 
                         when you got the job at the A.P., 
                         everything, he was so proud of you. 
                         I mean, that's the thing. Every moment 
                         he loved you.

               She's fighting tears, not the first ones she's shed over 
               this.

                                     JENNY
                         And as brightly as the sun would 
                         shine when he was with me, every 
                         time he left it disappeared. I wanted 
                         to be as important to him as you 
                         were, and I was never going to be. I 
                         was make-believe and his other life, 
                         you, were real.

               ANGLE ON Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts.

                                     JENNY
                         You knew that, didn't you?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WILL'S CAR - DAY / DRIVING

               Will skips through the stations on the radio, but ultimately 
               turns it off. He's trying to think.

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE - DUSK

               Will walks up the front steps. There's a subtle change to 
               his expression, a dark cloud lifted. He unlocks the door.

               INT. BLOOM HOUSE FOYER - DUSK

               It's half-dark and quiet in the house, no talking, no TV. 
               Will sets his keys on the table.

               INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

               Will looks in. Empty.

                                     WILL
                              (calling out)
                         Hello? Mom? Dad?

               INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DUSK

               We follow Will, looking into his and Josephine's room. He 
               aims for the guest room at the end of the hall.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DUSK

               Looking over his shoulder, we see his father's bed is empty. 
               The sheets are in a tangle on the floor.

               A beat, then Will half-runs back down the hall. Back down 
               the stairs.

               INT. FOYER - DUSK

               Headed out, Will grabs his keys off the table. We LOOK RIGHT, 
               where the "MESSAGE" light blinks on the answering machine.

               INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - NIGHT

               The hospital is so new, it's not even finished -- thick 
               plastic hangs from exposed framing. There's no one at the 
               information desk, so Will forges ahead.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Will reads a directory board, trying to decide the best place 
               to start. Then, behind him --

                                     JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                         Will!

               He turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She 
               was calling him.

                                     WILL
                         What happened?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Your father had a stroke. He's 
                         upstairs with your mom and Dr. 
                         Bennett.

                                     WILL
                         Is he going to be okay?

               A beat. How can she answer?

               He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of 
               course his father's not going to be okay.

                                     WILL
                         What I mean is, will he get back to 
                         the way he was when...

               She cuts him off --

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         No. He won't. I'm sorry.

               And like that, it's done. We HOLD ON Will, reeling from the 
               news.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Edward sleeps peacefully, just an oxygen tube under his nose. 
               There are no beeping monitors, no blinking lights. It's 
               mercifully quiet.

               Sandra squeezes Will's hand tightly. She's holding herself 
               together, but it's been a tough day.

               Dr. Bennett has just gone through the details for the third 
               time.

                                     SANDRA
                         I don't suppose one of us could stay 
                         with him. In case he...
                              (beat)
                         In case he wakes up, one of us should 
                         be there.

                                     WILL
                         I'll stay. Why don't you go home 
                         with Josephine and I'll stay tonight.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Dr. Bennett)
                         That's okay?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         It's fine.

                                     SANDRA
                              (to Will)
                         You'll call if...

                                     WILL
                         I will. I'll call.

               A beat.

                                     WILL
                         Mom, do you want some time with Dad?

                                     SANDRA
                         Yes. Thank you.

               A nod, then Will holds the door for Dr. Bennett and Josephine 
               as they leave. Sandra is alone in the room with her husband.

               She neatens his hair. Holds his hand. As she kisses his 
               fingers, she tweaks her chin with them -- his signature move.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT

               Sandra waits outside the women's restroom. Her face is a 
               study in strained composure -- acknowledging the inevitable 
               but refusing to surrender to it.

               Josephine emerges.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I'm sorry. It seems every hour I 
                         have to...

                                     SANDRA
                         I know. It was the same when I was 
                         carrying Will. Like clockwork.

               The two women start to walk, no hurry.

                                     SANDRA
                         Do you like it, being pregnant?

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         I do.

                                     SANDRA
                         I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but 
                         I loved every minute of it. I did. 
                         Eddie was travelling a lot, so he 
                         was gone, but I felt like I always 
                         had a piece of him with me. A little 
                         part of his soul inside me. I could 
                         feel it. It was alive and kicking.

               Sandra has accidentally evoked a storm of emotion. She 
               struggles to keep it in check. Almost a whisper...

                                     SANDRA
                         I really miss that.

               With a few breaths, Sandra tries to hold on. Hold back.

                                     JOSEPHINE
                         Don't stop. Don't.

               A beat, then Sandra finally melts. Josephine holds her. The 
               two women stand together in the hallway, letting the moment 
               be.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

               Will sits in a chair beside the bed, working through the 
               crossword puzzle. A KNOCK as Dr. Bennett enters with his 
               overcoat and bag, ready to leave for the night.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Glad to see you're not trying to 
                         have a heartfelt talk. It's one of 
                         my greatest annoyances, when people 
                         talk to those who can't hear them.

                                     WILL
                         My father and I have an advantage. 
                         We never talk.

               Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart.

                                     WILL
                         How long have you known my father?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Thirty years. Maybe more.

                                     WILL
                         How would you describe him?

                                     DR. BENNETT
                              (re: chart)
                         Five-eleven. One-eighty. Regulated 
                         hypertension.
                              (beat)
                         How would his son describe him?

               Tables turned, Will searches for an answer. He doesn't have 
               one.

               Dr. Bennett hangs the chart back on the bed.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Did your father ever tell you about 
                         the day you were born?

                                     WILL
                         A thousand times. He caught an 
                         uncatchable fish.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not that one. The real story. Did he 
                         ever tell you that?

                                     WILL
                              (suddenly interested)
                         No.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Your mother came in about three in 
                         the afternoon. Her neighbor drove 
                         her, on account of your father was 
                         on business in Wichita. You were 
                         born a week early, but there were no 
                         complications. It was a perfect 
                         delivery. Now, your father was sorry 
                         to miss it, but it wasn't the custom 
                         for the men to be in the room for 
                         deliveries then, so I can't see as 
                         it would have been much different 
                         had he been there. And that's the 
                         real story of how you were born.

               A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors 
               being paged.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Not very exciting, is it? And I 
                         suppose if I had to choose between 
                         the true version and an elaborate 
                         one involving a fish and a wedding 
                         ring, I might choose the fancy 
                         version. But that's just me.

               Will half-smiles.

               Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We STAY ON Will 
               and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and 
               starts making a list.

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - VARIOUS SHOTS

               Will flips to a new page. The list keeps getting longer.

               He smiles, remembering something. On his fourth page, he 
               looks up at his motionless father. A beat, then we slowly

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - PRE-DAWN

               It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is 
               glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, 
               Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, 
               the pen in his hand.

               He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What 
               woke him up?

               He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath.

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes 
               are open, scared and confused.

                                     WILL
                         Dad! Do you want me to get a nurse?

               Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Will already has his 
               finger on the orange "nurse call" button, but doesn't push 
               it.

                                     WILL
                         What can I do? Can I help? Can I get 
                         you something? Water?

               Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the 
               nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward 
               won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else.

                                     EDWARD
                              (whispering)
                         The river.

                                     WILL
                         The river?

               It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. 
               It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this 
               world.

                                     EDWARD
                         Tell me how it happens.

                                     WILL
                         How what happens?

                                     EDWARD
                         How I go.

               ON WILL, realizing...

                                     WILL
                         You mean what you saw in The Eye?

               Edward nods. Yes, that's what he was trying to say.

               A long beat.

                                     WILL
                         I don't know that story, Dad. You 
                         never told me that one.

               Will pushes his fingers under his father's heavy hand, and 
               holds it. There's nothing else to do.

               Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He 
               sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's 
               coming. Without the story, he's lost.

               Fighting the urge to panic --

                                     WILL
                         I can try, Dad. If you help. Just 
                         tell me how it starts.

                                     EDWARD
                         Like this.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. Okay.

               Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks 
               to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it.

               ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin.

                                     WILL
                         Okay. It's morning, and you and I 
                         are in the hospital. I'd fallen asleep 
                         in the chair. I wake up and I see 
                         you, and...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [STORY VERSION]

                                     WILL
                         Dad?

               It's dawn, and the first golden glow is shining through the 
               vertical blinds.

                                     WILL
                              (louder and concerned)
                         Dad?

               We LOOK OVER to find a nimble Edward sitting up in bed, 
               combing his hair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Let's get out of here.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Somehow, you're better. Different. 
                         You're getting ready to go. And I 
                         say...

                                     WILL
                         Dad, you're in no condition to...

               But Edward throws back the covers.

                                     EDWARD
                         There's a fold-up wheelchair in the 
                         bathroom. Wrap a blanket around me. 
                         As soon as we get off this floor, 
                         we'll be in the clear.

               Will heads for the bathroom. Sure enough, the wheelchair is 
               there.

                                     EDWARD
                         Hurry! We don't have much time.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               With the blanket draped over his head like a ghost, Edward 
               points for his son to steer the wheelchair thataway.

                                     EDWARD
                         Faster!

               They pass a HEAVYSET NURSE, who turns to look.

               Rounding a corner, they nearly crash into Dr. Bennett.

                                     DR. BENNETT
                         Will! I... What are you doing?

               Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair 
               himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with 
               him.

               The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room.

                                     NURSE
                         Security! Stop them!

               DOWN THE HALL

               At the elevators, Sandra and Josephine step out to find Will 
               and Edward barreling straight at them.

                                     EDWARD
                         No time to explain! Follow us!

               Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking 
               Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down.

               INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

               Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly 
               crashes into the back wall as the doors close.

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the 
               Chevrolet.

               AT THE CAR

               Will lifts his father out of the chair.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         I pick you up and you hardly weigh 
                         anything. I can't explain it.

               Will sets him in the passenger seat.

                                     EDWARD
                         Water. I need water.

               Scrambling in back, Will finds a liter of Arrowhead. Hands 
               it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, 
               he douses himself. Soaks the blanket.

               Will pops the trunk. Starts to fold up the wheelchair.

                                     EDWARD
                         Leave it! We won't need it.

               TIRES SMOKE as the car peals out.

                                                                   BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY [REALITY]

               TIGHT ON Will, trying to hold back tears as he talks.

                                     WILL
                         And we have to take Glenville to 
                         avoid all the church traffic, because 
                         those damn church people drive too 
                         slow.

               TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail. He's focused completely 
               on Will's story.

                                     WILL
                         I ask...

                                                                   BACK TO:

               EXT. GLENVILLE BLVD. - DAY [STORY VERSION]

               The Chevy slaloms through the Sunday-morning traffic.

                                     WILL (O.S.)
                         Where are we headed?

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         You say...

               INT. CHEVY - DAY

                                     EDWARD
                         The River!

               Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to 
               get around the jam. But it's no use.

               Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive 
               hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force.

               Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back.

               EXT. ASHTON RIVER - DAY

               The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of 
               more than 100 waiting.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         As we get closer to the river, we 
                         see everybody's already there. And I 
                         mean everybody.

               Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. 
               Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the 
               Mayor, and many others from along the way. No one has aged a 
               day since we saw them last.

               While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, 
               Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet.

                                     PING
                         He's here!

               The crowd CHEERS. The Ashton marching band PLAYS. Jenny Hill 
               smiles. So does the Old Woman.

               We PUSH IN on the Old Woman's glass eye, where we see...

               YOUNG EDWARD

               reflected. This is what he saw.

               INT. THE CHEVROLET - DAY

               Amazed, Will turns to his father.

                                     WILL
                         It's unbelievable.

                                     EDWARD
                         Story of my life.

               EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

               Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd. 
               Behind him, Sandra, Josephine and Dr. Bennett pull up. Karl 
               comes just after that.

               Crossing to the passenger side, Will lifts his father out. 
               Strangely, he's gotten even lighter. Will carries him easily.

               Edward pulls off his shoes, tying the laces together. He 
               hands them to Josephine. She throws them up at the powerline. 
               They loop over. APPLAUSE and CHEERS.

               The crowd parts to let Will and Edward get to the river. As 
               he passes, Edward shakes some hands, pats some people on the 
               cheek, and gives others a good poke in the ribs.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And the strange thing is, there's 
                         not a sad face to be found. Everyone's 
                         just so glad to see you, and send 
                         you off right.

               Will walks into the river, up to his knees. He turns back so 
               his father can face the crowd. Edward waves.

                                     EDWARD
                         Goodbye everybody! Farewell! Adieu!

                                     THE CROWD (VARIOUS)
                         Goodbye Edward! / See ya! / We'll 
                         miss you!

               But one face is missing from the crowd -- Sandra. Will turns 
               to see she's already standing in the river beside them.

               The reflection of the light off the water gives Sandra an 
               unearthly glow. She's more tranquil and more beautiful than 
               we've ever seen her.

                                     EDWARD
                         My girl in the river.

               She kisses him. He tweaks her chin. The crowd HOLLERS in 
               approval, but their moment remains strangely private. Only 
               Will is there to witness.

               As the kiss ends, Edward tries to pull off his wedding ring. 
               But it's stuck. Finally, he sucks on it, pulling it free 
               with his teeth.

               A look to Will, a smile with a glint of gold. Will takes the 
               ring out of his mouth.

               Edward suddenly drops out of Will's arms with a SPLASH. For 
               he's no longer a man, but rather

               A FAT CATFISH

               swimming at his feet.

               We watch as the catfish circles, then heads for deeper water, 
               disappearing.

               Will and his mother stand knee-deep in the water, watching 
               Edward Bloom swim away into the sunlight. Josephine is back 
               on the shore, along with the entire crowd.

               MUSIC BUILDS to a climax, then...

               Down the river, a GIANT FISH suddenly jumps out of the water, 
               cutting a beautiful arc across the sunset. It then dives 
               back under with a SPLASH.

                                                         CROSSFADE BACK TO:

               INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

               Will has tears hanging in the corners of his eyes.

                                     WILL
                         You become what you always were. A 
                         very big fish.
                              (he smiles)
                         And that's the way it happens.

                                     EDWARD
                              (a whisper)
                         Yes. Exactly.

               Edward smiles, proud of both of them. His eyes are so pale 
               and so open, we can almost see his soul. In every atom of 
               his body, in every thought, Edward Bloom is entirely happy.

               And this is how he goes.

               INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY

               Will shuts the door to his father's room behind him. The 
               walk to the payphones seems to take a lifetime.

               He finds a quarter, starts to dial. He has to squint to see 
               through the water in his eyes. It's ringing. And ringing. 
               The other end answers.

                                     WILL
                              (voice cracking)
                         Hi.

               That's all he can get out before the dam breaks inside him. 
               He presses closer to the phone, trying to shield himself.

               MUSIC begins that will carry us through the next passage.

               INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION - DAY

               Will waits at reception as Sandra and Josephine come off the 
               elevator.

               INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

               Josephine opens the curtains, letting white sunlight in. She 
               strips the bed.

               INT. BEDROOM - DAY

               Will and his mother pick out one of Edward's ties, for Will 
               to wear at the funeral. Will tries to button the cuffs on 
               the shirt he borrowed, but they're the kind that need links.

               He goes through the top drawer of the dresser, trying to 
               find a matching pair. Further down, he finds a ribbon tied 
               to

               THE KEY TO THE CITY.

               He smiles, disbelieving. It's a real thing.

               EXT. CEMETERY / ROAD - DAY

               Will helps his mother out of a black sedan. She's well-
               composed, not nearly the wreck we might have expected.

               Josephine hugs Dr. Bennett and shakes hands with his WIFE. 
               The service is crowded, more than 200 people, many more than 
               expected.

               As his mother talks to a WELL-WISHER, Will looks left to see 
               an Oldsmobile parking.

               CLOSE ON the license plates. Missouri.

               The passenger side opens, but the man who steps out is barely 
               visible over the door. He shuts it to reveal himself to be 
               70.

               It's Amos Calloway. Will doesn't recognize him.

               The Driver climbs out, a size 15 foot on the gravel. We TILT 
               UP to see this man is huge.

               This man is KARL, now 55. He's not 12 feet tall, but at least 
               six-eight.

               CLOSE ON Will, bewildered to see that this man really exists.

               EXT. CEMETERY / GRAVESIDE - DAY

               As the service gets ready to begin, Will guides his mother 
               to a seat near the grave.

               Sitting beside Will, Josephine spots a stunning ASIAN WOMAN 
               (50) behind them. A beat later, an identical face with glasses 
               peers out -- the woman's twin sister.

               It's PING and JING.

               Josephine almost GASPS. She elbows Will, who turns to look. 
               From this angle the sisters seem conjoined, but then Jing 
               steps forward. They're really two separate people. 

               A sea of familiar faces, all of them aged through the years: 
               BEAMEN, NORTHER WINSLOW, the MAYOR, and ZACKY PRICE.

               EXT. CEMETERY - DAY [LATER]

               After the service, we see the crowd gathered in small groups. 
               By the LAUGHTER and hand gestures, we can see they're telling 
               stories. They're telling Edward's stories.

               We find Will watching them.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         Have you ever heard a joke so many 
                         times you've forgotten why it's funny? 
                         But then you hear it again and 
                         suddenly it's new. You remember why 
                         you loved it in the first place.

               Will joins in, laughing.

               We slowly CIRCLE BEHIND a monument, letting it black out the 
               screen.

                                                             TRANSITION TO:

               EXT. BLOOM HOUSE BACKYARD - DAY [SUMMER]

               Will sits on the porch with Sandra and Josephine, watching 
               his SON play in the pool with two NEIGHBOR KIDS.

                                     SON
                              (to the other boys)
                         So he said he'd fight the giant who 
                         was fifteen feet tall.

                                     KID
                         No way.

                                     SON
                              (calling over)
                         Dad, that's right, isn't it?

                                     WILL
                         Something like that.

                                     SON
                         See. So he was a giant but my grampa 
                         was going to fight him because he 
                         wasn't afraid of anything because 
                         he'd seen how he was going to die in 
                         this old lady's glass eye...

               Will smiles as his son continues the tale, which FADES. Sandra 
               takes Will's hand in hers, just listening.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         That was my father's final joke I 
                         guess. A man tells his stories so 
                         many times he becomes the stories. 
                         They live on after him.

                                                              CROSSFADE TO:

               EXT. RIVER / UNDERWATER - DAY

               A fat and happy catfish swims towards us.

                                     WILL (V.O.)
                         And in that way, he becomes immortal.

               The fish passes us with a SPLASH.

               CUT TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
THE BIG LEBOWSKI

 

			THE BIG LEBOWSKI

We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, 
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

				VOICE-OVER
		A way out west there was a fella, 
		fella I want to tell you about, fella 
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
		least, that was the handle his lovin' 
		parents gave him, but he never had 
		much use for it himself.  This 
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
		self-apply where I come from.  But 
		then, there was a lot about the Dude 
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
		to me.  And a lot about where he 
		lived, like- wise.  But then again, 
		maybe that's why I found the place 
		s'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at 
twilight stretches out before us.

				VOICE-OVER
		They call Los Angeles the City of 
		Angels.  I didn't find it to be that 
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are 
		some nice folks there.  'Course, I 
		can't say I seen London, and I never 
		been to France, and I ain't never 
		seen no queen in her damn undies as 
		the fella says.  But I'll tell you 
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and 
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
		a those other places, and in English 
		too, so I can die with a smile on my 
		face without feelin' like the good 
		Lord gypped me.

INTERIOR   RALPH'S

It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking 
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the 
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed 
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their 
expiration dates.

				VOICE-OVER
		Now this story I'm about to unfold 
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict 
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I 
		only mention it 'cause some- times 
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
		there's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of 
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

				VOICE-OVER
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
		sometimes there's a man who, wal, 
		he's the man for his time'n place, 
		he fits right in there--and that's 
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.

CHECKOUT GIRL

She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to 
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with 
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

				GEORGE BUSH
		This aggression will not stand. . . 
		This will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at 
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

				VOICE-OVER
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
		the Dude was certainly that--quite 
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
		County.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and 
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

				VOICE-OVER
		...which would place him high in the 
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
		there's a man.

EXTERIOR  RALPH'S

Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or 
three cars parked in the huge lot.

				VOICE-OVER
		Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.  
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced him 
		enough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and 
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S HOUSE

The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow 
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small 
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the 
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

INSIDE

The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, 
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece 
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a 
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small 
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of 
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper 
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet 
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the 
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

				VOICE
		We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny 
		said you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and 
gasps for air.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

				VOICE
		WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

				DUDE
		It's uh, it's down there somewhere.  
		Lemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

				VOICE
		Don't fuck with us.  If your wife 
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that 
		means you owe money to Jackie 
		Treehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and 
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against 
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly 
and walks over to a rug.

				CHINESE MAN
		Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his 
sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Oh, man.  Don't do--

				BLOND MAN
		You see what happens?  You see what 
		happens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You 
		got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, 
		man.

				BLOND MAN
		Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is 
		Bunny.

				DUDE
		Bunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

				DUDE
		You see a wedding ring?  Does this 
		place look like I'm fucking married?   
		All my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a 
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious 
native.

				BLOND MAN
		The fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights 
it.

				DUDE
		Obviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

				BLOND MAN
		Woo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

				WOO
		Yeah?

				BLOND MAN
		Wasn't this guy supposed to be a 
		millionaire?

				WOO
		Uh?

They both look around.

				WOO
		Fuck.

				BLOND MAN
		What do you think?

				WOO
		He looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger 
and peeks over them.

				DUDE
		Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

				WOO
		Fuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

				BLOND MAN
		Thanks a lot, asshole.

						 ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins 
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, 
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a 
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant 
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail 
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

				MAN
		Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  
		Mark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man 
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried 
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves 
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He 
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he 
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears 
some of its foam on his mustache.

				WALTER
		This was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

				WALTER
		This was, uh--

				DUDE
		Yeah man, it really tied the room 
		together--

				WALTER
		This was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

				DONNY
		What tied the room together, Dude?

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the story, 
		Donny?

				DONNY
		What--

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the Dude's 
		story?

				DONNY
		I was bowling--

				WALTER
		So you have no frame of reference, 
		Donny.  You're like a child who 
		wanders in in the middle of a movie 
		and wants to know--

				DUDE
		What's your point, Walter?

				WALTER
		There's no fucking reason--here's my 
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

				DONNY
		Yeah Walter, what's your point?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		What's the point of--we all know who 
		was at fault, so what the fuck are 
		you talking about?

				WALTER
		Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you 
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about 
		unchecked aggression here--

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				DUDE
		My rug.

				WALTER
		Forget it, Donny.  You're out of 
		your element.

				DUDE
		This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I 
		can't go give him a bill so what the 
		fuck are you talking about?

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?!  
		This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm 
		talking about drawing a line in the 
		sand, Dude.  Across this line you do 
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is 
		not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- 
		American.  Please.

				DUDE
		Walter, this is not a guy who built 
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy 
		who peed on my--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you--

				DUDE
		Walter, he peed on my rug--

				DONNY
		He peed on the Dude's rug--

				WALTER
		YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This 
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

				DUDE
		So who--

				WALTER
		Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other 
		Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.  
		He's gonna be easier to find anyway 
		than these two, uh. these two  . . . 
		And he has the wealth, uh, the 
		resources obviously, and there is no 
		reason, no FUCKING reason, why his 
		wife should go out and owe money and 
		they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		No, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Okay. That, uh.

He elaborately clears his throat.

That rap really tied the room together, did it not?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				DONNY
		And this guy peed on it.

				WALTER
		Donny!  Please!

				DUDE
		Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

				DONNY
		His name is Lebowski?  That's your 
		name, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should 
		compensate me for the fucking rug.  
		I mean his wife goes out and owes 
		money and they pee on my rug.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on 
		your fucking Rug.

CLOSE ON A PLAQUE

We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver 
to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, 
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room 
with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:

				YOUNG MAN
		And this is the study.  You can see 
		the various commendations, honorary 
		degrees, et cetera.

				DUDE
		Yes, uh, very impressive.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please, feel free to inspect them.

				DUDE
		I'm not really, uh.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please!  Please!

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and

certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:

				YOUNG MAN
		That's the key to the city of 
		Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was 
		given two years ago in recognition 
		of his various civic, uh.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				YOUNG MAN
		That's a Los Angeles Chamber of 
		Commerce Business Achiever award, 
		which is given--not necessarily given 
		every year!  Given only when there's 
		a worthy, somebody especially--

				DUDE
		Hey, is this him with Nancy?

				YOUNG MAN
		That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the 
		first lady, yes, taken when--

				DUDE
		Lebowski on the right?

				YOUNG MAN
		Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, 
		Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

				DUDE
		He's handicapped, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And 
		this picture was taken when Mrs. 
		Reagan was first lady of the nation, 
		yes, yes? Not of California.

				DUDE
		Far out.

				YOUNG MAN
		And in fact he met privately with 
		the President, though unfortunately 
		there wasn't time for a photo 
		opportunity.

				DUDE
		Nancy's pretty good.

				YOUNG MAN
		Wonderful woman.  We were very--

				DUDE
		Are these.

				YOUNG MAN
		These are Mr. Lebowski's children, 
		so to speak--

				DUDE
		Different mothers, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		No, they--

				DUDE
		I guess he's pretty, uh, racially 
		pretty cool--

				YOUNG MAN
		They're not his, heh-heh, they're 
		not literally his children; they're 
		the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		inner-city children of promise but 
		without the--

				DUDE
		I see.

				YOUNG MAN
		--without  the means  for higher  
		education, so Mr. Lebowski  has 
		committed  to sending  all of them 
		to college.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  Think he's got room for one 
		more?

				YOUNG MAN
		One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went 
		to college?

				DUDE
		Well, yeah I did, but I spent most 
		of my time occupying various, um, 
		administration buildings--

				YOUNG MAN
		Heh-heh--

				DUDE
		--smoking thai-stick, breaking into 
		the ROTC--

				YOUNG MAN
		Yes, heh--

				DUDE
		--and bowling.  I'll tell you the 
		truth, Brandt, I don't remember most 
		of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed 
Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI 
ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we 
realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the 
display is mirrored.

We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, 
wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.

So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He 
wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.

Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized 
wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

				LEBOWSKI
		Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a 
		Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very 
		busy so what can I do for you?

He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him 
as Brandt withdraws.

				DUDE
		Well sir, it's this rug I have, really 
		tied the room together-

				LEBOWSKI
		You told Brandt on the phone, he 
		told me.  So where do I fit in?

				DUDE
		Well they were looking for you, these 
		two guys, they were trying to--

				LEBOWSKI
		I'll say it again, all right?  You 
		told Brandt.  He told me.  I know 
		what happened. Yes?  Yes?

				DUDE
		So you know they were trying to piss 
		on your rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		You mean, did you personally come 
		and pee on my--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla 
		usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.  
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		Well no, like I said, Woo peed on 
		the rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I 
		just want to understand this, sir--
		every time a rug is micturated upon 
		in this fair city, I have to 
		compensate the--

				DUDE
		Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam 
		anybody here, I'm just--

				LEBOWSKI
		You're just looking for a handout 
		like every other--are you employed, 
		Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Look, let me explain something.   
		I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. 
		Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  
		what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. 
		His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  
		you know, you're not into the whole 
		brevity thing--

				LEBOWSKI
		Are you employed, sir?

				DUDE
		Employed?

				LEBOWSKI
		You don't go out and make a living 
		dressed like that in the middle of a 
		weekday.

				DUDE
		Is this a--what day is this?

				LEBOWSKI
		But I do work, so if you don't mind--

				DUDE
		No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.  
		This will not stand, ya know, this 
		will not stand, man.  I mean, if 
		your wife owes--

				LEBOWSKI
		My wife is not the issue here. I 
		hope that my wife will someday learn 
		to live on her allowance, which is 
		ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that 
		will be her problem, not mine, just 
		as your rug is your problem, just as 
		every bum's lot in life is his own 
		responsibility regardless of whom he 
		chooses to blame.  I didn't blame 
		anyone for the loss of my legs, some 
		chinaman in Korea took them from me 
		but I went out and achieved anyway.  
		I can't solve your problems, sir, 
		only you can.

The Dude rises.

				DUDE
		Ah fuck it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!  
		Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your 
		answer to everything!

The Dude is heading for the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		Your "revolution" is over, Mr.  
		Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums 
		lost!

As the Dude opens the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		...My advice is, do what your parents 
		did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will 
		always lose-- do you hear me, 
		Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find 
himself--

				HALLWAY
		--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt 
		is approaching.

				BRANDT
		How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Okay.  The old man told me to take 
		any rug in the house.

WALKWAY

A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down 
a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming 
pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.

				BRANDT
		Manolo will load it into your car 
		for you, uh, Dude.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW

Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her 
back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the 
pool.

				BRANDT
		Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see 
		you again some time, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the 
		neighborhood, need to use the john.

CLOSER TRACK

Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the 
nails emerald green.

THE DUDE

Looking.

WIDER

The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early 
twenties.

She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Blow on them.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over 
them.

				DUDE
		Huh?

She waggles her foot and giggles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		G'ahead.  Blow.

The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

				DUDE
		You want me to blow on your toes?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

The Dude looks over at the pool.

				DUDE
		You sure he won't mind?

The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He 
is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He 
wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, 
shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.  
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty 
whiskey bottle bobs.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Dieter doesn't care about anything.  
		He's a nihilist.

				DUDE
		Practicing?

The young woman smiles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		You're not blowing.

Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

				BRANDT
		Our guest has to be getting along, 
		Mrs.  Lebowski.

The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still 
looking at the young woman.

				DUDE
		You're Bunny?

				BUNNY
		I'll suck your cock for a thousand 
		dollars.

Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very 
		free-spirited.  We're all very fond 
		of her.

				BUNNY
		Brandt can't watch though.  Or he 
		has to pay a hundred.

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his

SHOULDER:

				DUDE
		I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

THE BOWLERS

Donny calls out from the bench:

				DONNY
		Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in 
		the water!!

As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to 
another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that 
shares the lane.

				DUDE
		Your maples, Carl.

Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in 
one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.

				WALTER
		Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it 
		is no dream.

				DUDE
		You're fucking twenty minutes late.  
		What the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Theodore Herzel.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		State of Israel.  If you will it, 
		Dude, it is no--

				DUDE
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		The carrier.  What's in the fucking 
		carrier?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		Can't leave him home alone or he 
		eats the furniture.

				DUDE
		What the fuck are you--

				WALTER
		I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		I'm looking after it while Cynthia 
		and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

				DUDE
		You brought a fucking Pomeranian 
		bowling?

				WALTER
		What do you mean "brought it bowling"?  
		I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not 
		buying it a fucking beer.  He's not 
		gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots 
around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging 
its tail.

				DUDE
		Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked 
		me to take care of her fucking dog 
		while she and her boyfriend went to 
		Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck 
		herself.  Why can't she board it?

				WALTER
		First of all, Dude, you don't have 
		an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show 
		dog with fucking papers.  You can't 
		board it.  It gets upset, its hair 
		falls out.

				DUDE
		Hey man--

				WALTER
		Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over 
		the line!

Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

				WALTER
		Smokey Huh?

				WALTER
		Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.  
		That's a foul.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

				WALTER
		Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit. Walter!

				WALTER
		This is not Nam.  This is bowling.  
		There are rules.

				DUDE
		Come on Walter, it's just--it's 
		Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a 
		little, it's just a game.

				WALTER
		This is a league game.  This 
		determines who enters the next round-
		robin, am I wrong?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the 
		marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an 
		eight.

Walter takes out a gun.

				WALTER
		Smokey my friend, you're entering a 
		world of pain.

				DUDE
		Hey Walter--

				WALTER
		Mark that frame an eight, you're 
		entering a world of pain.

				SMOKEY
		I'm not--

				WALTER
		A world of pain.

A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a 
phone.

				SMOKEY
		Look Dude, I don't hold with this.  
		This guy is your partner, you should--

Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.

				WALTER
		HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM 
		I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT 
		ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!

The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making 
high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

				DUDE
		Walter, they're calling the cops, 
		put the piece away.

				WALTER
		MARK IT ZERO!

				SMOKEY
		Walter--

				WALTER
		YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?  
		MARK IT ZERO!!

				SMOKEY
		All right!  There it is!  It's fucking 
		zero!

He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.

				SMOKEY
		You happy, you crazy fuck?

				WALTER
		This is a league game, Smokey!

PARKING LOT

Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian 
trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

				DUDE
		Walter, you can't do that.  These 
		guys're like me, they're pacificists.  
		Smokey was a conscientious objector.

				WALTER
		You know Dude, I myself dabbled with 
		pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, 
		of course--

				DUDE
		And you know Smokey has emotional 
		problems!

				WALTER
		You mean--beyond pacifism?

				DUDE
		He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

As the two men get into the car:

				WALTER
		Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, 
		it's water under the bridge.  And we 
		do enter the next round-robin, am I 
		wrong?

				DUDE
		No, you're not wrong--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		You're not wrong, Walter, you're 
		just an asshole.

They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

				WALTER
		Okay then.  We play Quintana and 
		O'Brien next week.  They'll be 
		pushovers.

				DUDE
		Just, just take it easy, Walter.

				WALTER
		That's your answer to everything, 
		Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism 
		is not--look at our current situation 
		with that camelfucker in Iraq--
		pacifism is not something to hide 
		behind.

				DUDE
		Well, just take 't easy, man.

				WALTER
		I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

				WALTER
			(smugly)
		Calmer than you are.

-his irritates the Dude further.

				DUDE
		Just take it easy, man!

Walter is still smug.

				WALTER
		Calmer than you are.

DUDE'S HOUSE

A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
up old furniture.

At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing 
kalhua, rum and milk.

				VOICE
		Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't 
		wanna be a hard-on about this, and I 
		know it wasn't your fault, but I 
		just thought it was fair to tell you 
		that Gene and I will be submitting 
		this to the League and asking them 
		to set aside the round.  Or maybe 
		forfeit it to us--

				DUDE
		Shit!

				VOICE
		--so, like I say, just thought, you 
		know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

A beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, 
		well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.  
		Please call us as soon as is 
		convenient.

Beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski 
		with the Southern Cal Bowling League.  
		I just got a, an informal report, 
		uh, that a uh, a member of your team, 
		uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded 
		weapon during league play--

We hear the doorbell.

THE DOOR

It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding 
middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.

				DUDE
		Hiya Allan.

				ALLAN
		Dude, I finally got the venue I 
		wanted.  I'm Performing my dance 
		quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane 
		Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on 
		Tuesday night, and I'd love it if 
		you came and gave me notes.

The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.

				DUDE
		Sure Allan, I'll be there.

				ALLAN
		Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the 
		tenth.

				DUDE
		Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

				ALLAN
		Just, uh, just slip the rent under 
		my door.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

The  voice continues on the machine.

				VOICE
		--serious infraction, and examine 
		your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

				VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please 
		do call us when you get in and I'll 
		send the limo.  Let me assure you--I 
		hope you're not avoiding this call 
		because of the rug, which, I assure 
		you, is not a problem.  We need your 
		help and, uh--well we would very 
		much like to see you.  Thank you.  
		It's Brandt.

TRACKING

We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.  
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back 
over

HIS SHOULDER:

				BRANDT
		We've had some terrible news.  Mr. 
		Lebowski is in seclusion in the West 
		Wing.

				DUDE
		Huh.

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music 
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey 
Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly 
into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski.

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.

				LEBOWSKI
		It's funny.  I can look back on a 
		life of achievement, on challenges 
		met, competitors bested, obstacles 
		overcome.  I've accomplished more 
		than most men, and without the use 
		of my legs.  What. . . What makes a 
		man, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Huh?

				DUDE
		I don't know, sir.

				LEBOWSKI
		Is it. . . is it, being prepared to 
		do the right thing?  Whatever the 
		price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

				DUDE
		Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost 
in thought.

				LEBOWSKI
		You're joking.  But perhaps you're 
		right.

The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.

				DUDE
		Mind if I smoke a jay?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny.

He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on 
his cheeks.

				DUDE
		'Scuse me?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light 
		of my life.  Are you surprised at my 
		tears, sir?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				LEBOWSKI
		Strong men also cry. . . Strong men 
		also cry.

He clears his throat.

				LEBOWSKI
		I received this fax this morning.

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and 
hands it to the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		As you can see, it is a ransom note.  
		Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable 
		to achieve on a level field of play.  
		Men who will not sign their names.  
		Weaklings.  Bums.

THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:

WE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.

				DUDE
		Bummer.

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt will fill you in on the 
		details.

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.  
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the 
hall.

HALLWAY

The soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice 
is hushed:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a 
		generous offer to you to act as 
		courier once we get instructions for 
		the money.

				DUDE
		Why me, man?

				BRANDT
		He suspects that the culprits might 
		be the very people who, uh, soiled 
		your rug, and you're in a unique 
		position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm 
		that suspicion.

				DUDE
		So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, 
		huh?

				BRANDT
		Well Dude, we just don't know.

BOWLING PINS

CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

WIDER

Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of 
the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying 
perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch 
bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.

FAST TRACK IN

On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic 
chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

				DUDE
		Fucking Quintana--that creep can 
		roll, man--

BACK TO THE BOWLER

Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's 
conversation continues over.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, 
		Dude.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		The man is a sex offender.  With a 
		record.  Spent six months in Chino 
		for exposing himself to an eight-
		year-old.

FLASHBACK

We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,  
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging 
the bell.

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.

				DUDE
		Huh.

				WALTER
		When he moved down to Venice he had 
		to go door-to-door to tell everyone 
		he's a pederast.

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man 
looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

				DONNY
		What's a pederast, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.

PINS

scattered by a strike.

QUINTANA

wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.

Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his 
first name, "Jesus".

BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE

They have been joined by Donny.

				WALTER
		Anyway.  How much they offer you?

				DUDE
		Twenty grand.  And of course I still 
		keep the rug.

				WALTER
		Just for making the hand-off?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.

				DUDE
		...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so  
		whenever these guys call--

				WALTER
		What if it's during a game?

				DUDE
		I told him if it was during league 
		play--

Donny has been watching Quintana.

				DONNY
		If what's during league play?

				WALTER
		Life does not stop and start at your 
		convenience, you miserable piece of 
		shit.

				DONNY
		What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

				DUDE
		I figure it's easy money, it's all 
		pretty harmless.  I mean she probably 
		kidnapped herself.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DONNY
		What do you mean, Dude?

				DUDE
		Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean 
		look at it.  Young trophy wife.  
		Marries a guy for money but figures 
		he isn't giving her enough.  She 
		owes money all over town--

				WALTER
		That...fucking...bitch!

				DUDE
		It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin 
		said, look for the person who will 
		benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, 
		you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying 
		to say--

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		That fucking bitch!

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!  
		Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				WALTER
		That's fucking exactly what happened, 
		Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

				DONNY
		Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed 
		off?

				WALTER
		Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking 
		thing-- I did not watch my buddies 
		die face down in the muck so that 
		this fucking strumpet--

				DUDE
		I don't see any connection to Vietnam, 
		Walter.

				WALTER
		Well, there isn't a literal 
		connection, Dude.

				DUDE
		Walter, face it, there isn't any 
		connection.  It's your roll.

				WALTER
		Have it your way.  The point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll--

				WALTER
		The fucking point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll.

				VOICE
		Are you ready to be fucked, man?

They both look up.

Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of 
the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a 
windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the 
breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball 
satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his 
partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.

				QUINTANA
		I see you rolled your way into the 
		semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and 
		me, we're gonna fuck you up.

				DUDE
		Yeah well, that's just, ya know, 
		like, your opinion, man.

Quintana looks at Walter.

				QUINTANA
		Let me tell you something, bendeco.  
		You pull any your crazy shit with 
		us, you flash a piece out on the 
		lanes, I'll take it away from you 
		and stick it up your ass and pull 
		the fucking trigger til it goes 
		"click".

				DUDE
		Jesus.

				QUINTANA
		You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with 
		the Jesus.

Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.

				WALTER
		Eight-year-olds, Dude.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  
His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an 
intermittent clatter.

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE 
BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.

The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall 
rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the 
Dude opens his eyes.

He screams.

A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  
in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards 
the carrier.

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head 
thunking back onto the rug.

A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear 
the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.

The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of 
Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in 
front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his 
bowling shirt. He looks up.

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the 
Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing 
us, growing smaller.

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices 
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic 
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its 
weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He 
is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down 
toward the city, dragged by the ball.

A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us 
out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  
the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in 
black.

We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections 
materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny 
surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of 
a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being 
regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass 
rolling a huge shadow across his face.

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward 
us --finger holes.

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing 
us once again in black..

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a 
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in 
the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde 
woman, performing her follow-through.

Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and 
away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; 
ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins 
spin, hit each other and drop.

We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.

FADE IN

We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades 
in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is 
now askew, with one arm off his ear.

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put 
him right side around.  His head is now resting against 
hardwood floor, not rug.

				DUDE
		Oh man.

He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  
red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  
blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.

WIDE ON THE ROOM

An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  
in place. The rug is gone.

The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   
The beeps continue.

The phone starts to jangle.

TRACK

We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   
Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  
wrist to  look at  his watch.

				BRANDT
		They called about eighty minutes 
		ago.  They want you to take the money 
		and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll 
		call you on the portable phone with 
		instructions in about forty minutes.  
		One person only or I'd go with you.  
		They were very clear on that: one 
		person only.  What happened to your 
		jaw?

				DUDE
		Oh, nothin', you know.

They have reached the little desk outside of the big 
Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key 
and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude 
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

				BRANDT
		Here's the money, and the phone.  
		Please, Dude, follow whatever 
		instructions they give.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Oh, man, don't say that..

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Shit.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands, Dude.  
		And report back to us as soon as 
		it's done.

DUDE'S CAR

We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through 
the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter 
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK 
SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the 
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look 
oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape 
bundled in brown wrapping paper.

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door 
and hands in the briefcase.

				WALTER
		Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.

				DUDE
		The what?

				WALTER
		The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have 
		they called yet?

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it 
as the car starts rolling.

				DUDE
		What the hell is this?

				WALTER
		My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  
		The whites.

				DUDE
		Agh--

He closes the briefcase.

				DUDE
		Walter, I'm sure there's a reason 
		you brought your dirty undies--

				WALTER
		Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  
		The ringer can't look empty.

				DUDE
		Walter--what the fuck are you 
		thinking?

				WALTER
		Well you're right, Dude, I got to 
		thinking.  I got to thinking why 
		should we settle for a measly fucking 
		twenty grand--

				DUDE
		We?  What the fuck we?  You said you 
		just wanted to come along--

				WALTER
		My point, Dude, is why should we 
		settle for twenty grand when we can 
		keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a 
		fucking game, Walter--

				WALTER
		It is a fucking game.  You said so 
		yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

				DUDE '
		Yeah, but--

The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
			(German accent)
		Who is this?

				DUDE
		Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want 
		us to go?

				VOICE
		...Us?
		DUDE

Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not 
handling the money and driving the car and talking on the 
phone all by my fucking--

				VOICE
		Shut the fuck up.
			(Beat)
		Hello?

				DUDE
		Yeah?

				VOICE
		Okay, listen--

Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

				WALTER
		Dude, are you fucking this up?

				VOICE
		Who is that?

				DUDE
		The driver man, I told you--

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		Oh shit.  Walter.

				WALTER
		What the fuck is going on there?

				DUDE
		They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it 
		up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was 
		in our hands!

				WALTER
		Easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		We're screwed now!  We don't get 
		shit and they're gonna kill her!  
		We're fucked, Walter!

				WALTER
		Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.  
		You're being very unDude.  They'll 
		call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

The phone chirps.

				WALTER
		Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, 
		Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These  
		guys are fucking amateurs--

				DUDE
		Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say 
		peep when I'm doing business here.

				WALTER
			(patronizing)
		Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

				WALTER
		But they're amateurs.

The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
		Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there 
		is no funny stuff.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				VOICE
		So no funny stuff.  Okay?

				DUDE
		Hey, just tell me where the fuck you 
		want us to go.

A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD

It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

				DUDE
		That was the sign.

Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

				WALTER
		Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, 
		nobody's in a position to complain.  
		And we keep the baksheesh.

				DUDE
		Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't 
		told me how we get her back.  Where 
		is she?

				WALTER
		That's the simple part, Dude.  When  
		we make the handoff, I grab the guy 
		and beat  it out of him.

He looks at the Dude.

				WALTER
		...Huh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  
		That's fucking ingenious, if I 
		understand it correctly.  That's a 
		Swiss fucking watch.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of 
		this is its simplicity. If the plan 
		gets too complex something always 
		goes wrong.  If there's one thing I 
		learned in Nam--

The phone chirps.

				DUDE
		Dude.

				VOICE
		You are approaching a vooden britch.  
		When you cross it you srow ze bag 
		from ze left vindow of ze moving 
		kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch 
		you.

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		FUCK.

				WALTER
		What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
		off?

				DUDE
		There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   
		At a wooden bridge we throw the money 
		out  of the car!

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		We throw the money out of the moving 
		car!

Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

				WALTER
		We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks 
		up our plan.

				DUDE
		Well call them up and explain it to 
		'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking 
		simple, I'm sure they'd fucking 
		understand it!  That's the beauty of 
		it Walter!

				WALTER
		Wooden bridge, huh?

				DUDE
		I'm throwing the money, Walter!  
		We're not fucking around!

				WALTER
		The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the 
		ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

				DUDE
		Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but 
		sooner or later you're gonna have to 
		face the fact that you're a goddamn 
		moron.

				WALTER
		Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's 
		the bridge--

There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from 
the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to 
grab the laundry.

And there goes the ringer.

He flings it out the window.

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

				DUDE
		What the fuck?

				WALTER
		Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch 
		I roll out!  I double back, grab one 
		of 'em and beat it out of him!  The 
		uzi!

				DUDE
		Uzi?

Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

				WALTER
		You didn't think I was rolling out 
		of here naked!

				DUDE
		Walter, please--

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out 
over the road.

				WALTER
		Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's 
		take that hill!

Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he 
hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, 
cursing, takes the wheel.

OUTSIDE

Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle 
flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

INSIDE THE CAR

The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

OUTSIDE

The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

INSIDE

The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

OUTSIDE

As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The 
front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps 
back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.

WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  
injured knee.

The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  
frantically waving the satchel in the air.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!

There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto 
the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires 
squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite 
direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring 
motorcycles.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching 
the three red tail lights fishtail away.

AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:

				WALTER
		Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

BOWLING LANE

A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.

WALTER.

He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of 
molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable 
phone in his lap.  It is ringing.

				WALTER
		Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used 
		to say.

				DUDE
		What the fuck is that supposed to 
		mean?  What the fuck're we gonna 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't 
		see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

The portable phone stops ringing.

				DUDE
		Huh?  The problem is--what do you 
		mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
		they're gonna kill that poor woman--

				WALTER
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		That poor woman--that poor slut--
		kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said 
		so yourself--

				DUDE
		No, Walter!  I said I thought she 
		kidnapped herself!  You're the one 
		who's so fucking certain--

				WALTER
		That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

Donny is trotting excitedly up.

				DONNY
		They posted the next round of the 
		tournament--

				WALTER
		Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

				DONNY
		This Saturday.  Quintana and--

				WALTER
		Saturday!  Well they'll have to 
		reschedule.

				DUDE
		Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		I told that fuck down at the league 
		office-- who's in charge of 
		scheduling?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				DONNY
		Burkhalter.

				WALTER
		I told that kraut a fucking thousand 
		times I don't roll on shabbas.

				DONNY
		It's already posted.

				WALTER
		WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about 
		that poor woman?  What do we tell--

				WALTER
		C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get 
		sick of her little game and, you 
		know, wander back--

				DONNY
		How come you don't roll on Saturday, 
		Walter?

				WALTER
		I'm shomer shabbas.

				DONNY
		What's that, Walter?

				DUDE
		Yeah, and in the meantime what do I 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of 
		rest.  Means I don't work, I don't 
		drive a car, I don't fucking ride in 
		a car, I don't handle money, I don't 
		turn on the oven, and I sure as shit 
		don't fucking roll!

				DONNY
		Sheesh.

				DUDE
		Walter, how--

				WALTER
		Shomer shabbas.

The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

				DUDE
		That's it.  I'm out of here.

				WALTER
		For Christ's sake, Dude.

Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling 
alley.

Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the 
hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--

				DONNY
		Oh yeah, how'd it go?

				WALTER
		Went alright.  Dude's car got a little 
		dinged up--

				DUDE
		But Walter, we didn't make the fucking 
		hand- off!  They didn't get, the 
		fucking money and they're gonna--
		they're gonna--

				WALTER
		Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

				WALTER
		Kill that poor woman.

				DONNY
		Walter, if you can't ride in a car, 
		how d'you get around on Shammas--

				WALTER
		Really, Dude, you surprise me.  
		They're not gonna kill shit.  They're 
		not gonna do shit.  What can they 
		do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, 
		look at the bottom line.  Who's 
		sitting on a million fucking dollars?  
		Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		Who's got a fucking million fucking 
		dollars parked in the trunk of our 
		car out here?

				DUDE
		"Our" car, Walter?

				WALTER
		And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty 
		undies.  My fucking whites--Say, 
		where is  the car?

The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out 
at an empty parking space.

				DONNY
		Who has your undies, Walter?

				WALTER
		Where's your car, Dude?

				DUDE
		You don't know, Walter?  You seem to 
		know the answer to everything else!

				WALTER
		Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped 
		spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

				DUDE
		It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking 
		know it's been stolen!

				WALTER
		Well, certainly that's a possibility, 
		Dude--

				DUDE
		Aw, fuck it.

The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts 
ringing again.

				DONNY
		Where you going, Dude?

				DUDE
		I'm going home, Donny.

				DONNY
		Your phone's ringing, Dude.

				DUDE
		Thank you, Donny.

DUDE'S LIVING ROOM

The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, 
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him 
on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, 
the other a fresh-faced rookie.

At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  
The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:

				DUDE
		1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

				YOUNGER COP
		Color?

				DUDE
		Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, 
		coloration.

				YOUNGER COP
		And was there anything of value in  
		the car?

DULLY:

				DUDE
		Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple 
		of Creedence tapes.  And there was 
		a, uh. . . my briefcase.

				YOUNGER COP
		In the briefcase?

				DUDE
		Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my 
		papers.  Business papers.

				YOUNGER COP
		And what do you do, sir?

				DUDE
		I'm unemployed.

				OLDER COP
		...Most people, we're working nights, 
		they offer us coffee.

There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the 
floor.  The older cop stares at him.

				DUDE
		...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But 
		it's nice when they offer.

AT LENGTH:

				DUDE
		...Also, my rug was stolen.

				YOUNGER COP
		Your rug was in the car.

The Dude taps the floor with his foot.

				DUDE
		No.  Here.

				YOUNGER COP
		Separate incidents?

The Dude stares at the floor.

Silence.

				OLDER COP
		Snap out of it, son.

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  
chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  
it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks 
on.

				DUDE
		You find them much?  Stolen cars?

Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message 
after the beep.  It takes a minute.

				YOUNGER COP
		Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much 
		hope for the tape deck though.  Or 
		the Creedence tapes.

				DUDE
		And the, uh, the briefcase?

Beep.

				FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  
		Call when you get home and I'll send 
		a car for you.  My name is Maude 
		Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took 
		the rug.

Beep.  Dial tone.

				OLDER COP
		Well, I guess we can close the file 
		on that one.

TRACKING FORWARD

We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown 
L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing 
industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are 
spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant 
rug.

We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, 
standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky 
depths of the cavernous space.

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended 
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the 
floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush 
in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two 
young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers 
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track 
and haul it back for another push.

				VOICE
		I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. 
		Lebowski.

She rumbles by in another pass.

All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  
Help me down.

The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  
except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  
and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix 
look.

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Is that what that's a picture of?

				MAUDE
		In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. 
		My art has been commended as being 
		strongly vaginal.  Which bothers 
		some men.  The word itself makes 
		some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

				DUDE
		Oh yeah?

				MAUDE
		Yes, they don't like hearing it and 
		find it difficult to say.  Whereas 
		without batting an eye a man will 
		refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or 
		his "Johnson".

				DUDE
		"Johnson"?

				MAUDE
		Thank you.

This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.

All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father 
told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a 
gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  
Now.  As for this. . . "kidnapping"--

				DUDE
		Huh?

				MAUDE
		Yes, I know about it.  And I know 
		that you acted as courier.  And let 
		me tell you something:  the whole 
		thing stinks to high heaven.

				DUDE
		Right, but let me explain something 
		about that rug--

				MAUDE
		Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				MAUDE
		Sex.  The physical act of love.  
		Coitus.  Do you like it?

				DUDE
		I was talking about my rug.

				MAUDE
		You're not interested in sex?

				DUDE
		You mean coitus?

				MAUDE
		I like it too.  It's a male myth 
		about feminists that we hate sex.  
		It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. 
		But unfortunately there are some 
		people--it is called satyriasis in 
		men, nymphomania in women--who engage 
		in it compulsively and without joy.

				DUDE
		Oh, no.

				MAUDE
		Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate 
		souls cannot love in the true sense 
		of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance 
		Bunny is one of these.

				DUDE
		Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your 
		stepmother is a nympho, but I don't 
		see what it has to do with--do you 
		have any kalhua?

				MAUDE
		Take a look at this, sir.

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen 
flickers to life.  A title card:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

SECOND CARD:

KARL HUNGUS

AND

BUNNY LAJOYA

IN

A THIRD CARD:

LOGJAMMIN'

The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  
to his glass.

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a 
door opening.

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  
man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  
Lebowski's pool.

				DIETER
		Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere 
		iss problem mit deine kable.

				DUDE
		Shit, I know that guy.  He's a 
		nihilist.

				MAUDE
		And you recognize her, of course.

The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

Bunny The TV is in here.

				DIETER
		Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use 
the shower.

				MAUDE
			(grimly)
		The story is ludicrous.

				DIETER
		Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to 
		verk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set.

				MAUDE
		Lord.  You can imagine where it goes 
		from here.

				DUDE
		He fixes the cable?

				MAUDE
		Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little 
		matter to me that this woman chose 
		to pursue a career

in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie 
Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am 
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other 
being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts 
and--

				DUDE
		Shit yeah, the achievers.

				MAUDE
		Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		yes, and proud we are of all of them.  
		I asked my father about his withdrawal 
		of a million dollars from the 
		Foundation account and he told me 
		about this "abduction", but I tell 
		you it is preposterous.  This 
		compulsive

fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but my-

				MAUDE
		I'm getting to your rug. My  father 
		and I don't get along; he doesn't 
		approve of my lifestyle and, needless 
		to say, I don't approve of his.  
		Still, I hardly wish to make my 
		father's embezzlement a police matter, 
		so I'm proposing that you try to 
		recover the money from the people 
		you delivered it to.

				DUDE
		Well--sure, I could do that--

				MAUDE
		If you successfully do so, I will 
		compensate you to the tune of 1% of 
		the recovered sum.

				DUDE
		A hundred.

				MAUDE
		Thousand, yes, bones or clams or 
		whatever you call them.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but what about--

				MAUDE
		--your rug, yes, well with that money 
		you can buy any number of rugs that 
		don't have sentimental value for me.  
		And I am sorry about that crack on 
		the jaw.

The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has 
all but disappeared.

				DUDE
		Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

				MAUDE
		Here's the name and number of a doctor 
		who will look at it for you.  You 
		will receive no bill.  He's a good 
		man, and thorough.

				DUDE
		That's really thoughtful but I--

				MAUDE
		Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

LIMO

The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to 
the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery 
cap a ponytail emerges.

				DRIVER
		--So he says, "My son can't hold a 
		job, my daughter's married to a 
		fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on 
		my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  
		But you know me.  I can't complain."

THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.			 
		Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya 
		Tony.

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves 
milk on his mustache.

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a 
little  money, I  was down in the dumps.

				TONY
		Aw, forget about it.

				DUDE
		Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be 
		worrying about that shit.  Life goes 
		on!

The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still 
holding his drink.

				TONY
		Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your 
		friend in the Volkswagon?

				DUDE
		Huh?

His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his 
shoulder.

He followed us here.

The Dude turns to look.

HIS POV

Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the 
curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

THE DUDE

He scowls.

				DUDE
		When did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

				SECOND CHAUFFEUR
		Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No 
		arguments.

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds 
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.

				DUDE
		Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

INSIDE

The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the 
rear. The door is slammed behind him.

				LEBOWSKI
		Start talking and talk fast you lousy 
		bum!

				BRANDT
		We've been frantically trying to 
		reach you, Dude.

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from 
the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

				LEBOWSKI
		Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

				DUDE
		Well we--I don't--

				LEBOWSKI
		They did not receive the money, you 
		nitwit!  They  did not receive the 
		goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR 
		HANDS!

				BRANDT
		This is our concern, Dude.

				DUDE
		No, man, nothing is fucked here--

				LEBOWSKI
		NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE 
		HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!

The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.

				DUDE
		C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?  
		Those guys are--we dropped off the 
		damn money--

				LEBOWSKI
		WHAT?!

				DUDE
		I--the royal we, you know, the 
		editorial--I dropped off the money, 
		exactly as per--Look, I've got certain 
		information, certain things have 
		come to light, and uh, has it ever 
		occurred to you, man, that given the 
		nature of all this new shit, that, 
		uh, instead of running around blaming 
		me, that this whole thing might just 
		be, not, you know, not just such a 
		simple, but uh--you know?

				LEBOWSKI
		What in God's holy name are you 
		blathering about?

				DUDE
		I'll tell you what I'm blathering 
		about!  I got information--new shit 
		has come to light and--shit, man!  
		She kidnapped herself!

Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.

				DUDE
		Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy 
		wife, I mean, in the parlance of our 
		times, owes money all over town, 
		including to known pornographers--
		and that's cool, that's cool-- but 
		I'm saying, she needs money, and of 
		course they're gonna say they didn't 
		get it 'cause she wants more, man, 
		she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
		hasn't that ever occurred to you...?  
		Sir?

				LEBOWSKI
			(quietly)
		No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not 
		occurred to me.

				BRANDT
		That had not occurred to us, Dude.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, you're not privy to all 
		the new shit, so uh, you know, but 
		that's what you pay me for.  Speaking 
		of which, would it be possible for 
		me to get my twenty grand in cash?  
		I gotta check this with my accountant 
		of course, but my concern is that, 
		you know, it could bump me into a 
		higher tax--

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt, give him the envelope.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, if you've already made 
		out the check.  Brandt is handing 
		him a letter-sized envelope which is 
		distended by something inside.

				BRANDT
		We received it this morning.

The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton 
wadding and unrolls it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Since you have failed to achieve, 
		even in the modest task that was 
		your charge, since you have stolen 
		my money, and since you have 
		unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up 
inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and 
starts to unroll the inner package.

				LEBOWSKI
		I have no choice but to tell these 
		bums that they should do whatever is 
		necessary to recover their money 
		from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And 
		with Brandt as my witness, tell you 
		this:  Any further harm visited upon 
		Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon 
		your head.

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents 
of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

				LEBOWSKI
		...By God sir.  I will not abide 
		another toe.

COFFEE SHOP

The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off 
into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little 
clinking noises.

AFTER A LONG BEAT:

				WALTER
		That wasn't her toe.

				DUDE
		Whose toe was it, Walter?

				WALTER
		How the fuck should I know?  I do 
		know that nothing about it indicates--

				DUDE
		The nail polish, Walter.

				WALTER
		Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible 
		to get some nail polish, apply it to 
		someone else's toe--

				DUDE
		Someone else's--where the fuck are 
		they gonna--

				WALTER
		You want a toe?  I can get you a 
		toe, believe me.  There are ways, 
		Dude.  You don't wanna know about 
		it, believe me.

				DUDE
		But Walter--

				WALTER
		I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this 
		afternoon--with nail  polish. These  
		fucking amateurs.   They send us a  
		toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- 
		selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My  
		point is--

				DUDE
		They're gonna kill her, Walter, and 
		then they're gonna kill me--

				WALTER
		Well that's just, that's the stress 
		talking, Dude.  So far we have what 
		looks to me like a series of 
		victimless crimes--

				DUDE
		What about the toe?

				WALTER
		FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

A waitress enters.

				WAITRESS
		Could you please keep your voices 
		down--this is a family restaurant.

				WALTER
		Oh, please dear!  I've got news for 
		you: the Supreme Court has roundly 
		rejected prior restraint!

				DUDE
		Walter, this isn't a First Amendment 
		thing.

				WAITRESS
		Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going 
		to have to ask you to leave.

				WALTER
		Lady, I got buddies who died face-
		down in the muck so you and I could 
		enjoy this family restaurant!

THE DUDE GETS UP:

				DUDE
		All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry 
		ma'am.

				WALTER
		Don't run away from this, Dude!  
		Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

				WALTER
		Our basic freedoms!

He looks defiantly around.

				WALTER
		I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, 
affecting nonchalance.

				WALTER
		Finishing my coffee.

DUDE'S BATHROOM

A dripping noise.

The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint 
pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.

The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the 
soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.

After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer 
		Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		We've recovered your vehicle.  It 
		can be claimed at the North Hollywood 
		Auto Circus there on Victory.

				DUDE
		Far out.  Far fuckin' out.

				MESSAGE
		You'll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of 
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

				DUDE
		Hunh?

He looks blearily at the open doorway.

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is 
striding across the living room towards the bathroom.

				DUDE
		Hey!  This is a private residence, 
		man!

The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the 
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other 
men are entering behind him.

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; 
the men are backlit shapes.

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small 
animal skitters excitedly about the floor.

The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

				DUDE
		Nice marmot.

The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, 
screaming, into the bathtub.

The Dude screams.

The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a 
frenzy of fearful aggression.

				FIRST MAN
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to 
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his 
head and squishes him back into the water.

				SECOND MAN
		You think veer kidding und making 
		mit de funny stuff?

				THIRD MAN
		Vee could do things you only dreamed 
		of, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.  
		Vee belief in nossing.

He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself 
off, spraying the Dude.

				DUDE
		Jesus!

				DIETER
		Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!  
		NOSSING!!

The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking 
itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

				DUDE
		Jesus Christ!

				FIRST MAN
		Tomorrow vee come back und cut off 
		your chonson.

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				FIRST MAN
		I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!

The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:

				SECOND MAN
		Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

				FIRST MAN
		Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und 
		skvush it, Lebowski!

NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS

A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a 
large parking lot.

				POLICEMAN
		You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.  
		Lebowski. Must've been a joyride 
		situation; they abandoned the car 
		once they hit the retaining wall.

They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side  
exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude  
a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.

				POLICEMAN
		These were on the road next to the 
		car.  You'll have to get in on the 
		other side.

The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

				POLICEMAN
		Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.  
		You're lucky they left the tape deck 
		though.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's 
		that smell?

				POLICEMAN
		Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept 
		in the car.  Or perhaps just used it 
		as a toilet, and moved on.

The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will 
not go; he bellows through the glass:

				DUDE
		When will you find these guys?  I 
		mean, do you have any promising leads?

The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.

				POLICEMAN
		Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with 
		the boys down at the Crime Lab.  
		They've assigned four more detectives 
		to the case, got us working in shifts.

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman 
rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by 
the glass.

BOWLING ALLEY BAR

The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a 
White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer 
nuts.

				DONNY
		And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

				WALTER
		Oh for Christ--will you shut the 
		fuck up, Donny.

				DUDE
		I figure my only hope is that the 
		big Lebowski kills me before the 
		Germans can cut my dick off.

				WALTER
		Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No 
		one is going to cut your dick off.

				DUDE
		Thanks Walter.

				WALTER
		Not if I have anything to say about 
		it.

				DUDE
			(bitterly)
		Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me 
		a very secure feeling.

				WALTER
		Dude--

				DUDE
		That makes me feel all warm inside.

				WALTER
		Now Dude--

				DUDE
		This whole fucking thing--I  could 
		be sitting here with just pee-stains 
		on my rug.

Walter sadly shakes his head.

				WALTER
		Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.  
		Fucking Nazis.

				DONNY
		They were Nazis, Dude?

				WALTER
		Come on, Donny, they were threatening 
		castration!

				DONNY
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Are you gonna split hairs?

				DONNY
		No--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong?

				DONNY
		Well--

				DUDE
		They're nihilists.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		They kept saying they believe in 
		nothing.

				WALTER
		Nihilists!  Jesus.

Walter looks haunted.

Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, 
Dude, at least it's an ethos.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		And let's also not forget--let's not 
		forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, 
		an amphibious rodent, for uh, 
		domestic, you know, within the city--
		that isn't legal either.

				DUDE
		What're you, a fucking park ranger 
		now?

				WALTER
		No, I'm--

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit about the fucking 
		marmot!

				WALTER
		--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

				DUDE
		Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need 
		your sympathy, man, I need my fucking 
		Johnson!

				DONNY
		What do you need that for, Dude?

				WALTER
		You gotta buck up, man, you can't go 
		into the tournament with this negative 
		attitude--

				DUDE
		Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you, 
		Walter!

There is a moment of stunned silence.

				WALTER
		Fuck the tournament?!

SAD; QUIET:

				WALTER
		Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want 
		to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's 
		go get a lane.

They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares

DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

				DUDE
		Another Caucasian, Gary.

				VOICE
		Right, Dude.

STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

				DUDE
		Friends like these, huh Gary.

				GARY
		That's right, Dude.

The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on 
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds."

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter 
vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam 
Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and 
wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.

TO THE BARTENDER:

				MAN
		D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?

We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened 
the movie.

				BARTENDER
		Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

The Stranger nods.

				THE STRANGER
		That's a good one.

Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His 
crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		How ya doin' there, Dude?

The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.

				DUDE
		Ahh, not so good, man.

				THE STRANGER
		One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser 
		fella than m'self once said, sometimes 
		you eat the bar and sometimes the 
		bar, wal, he eats you.

				DUDE
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern 
		thing?

				THE STRANGER
		Far from it.

				DUDE
		Mm.

The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the 
bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.

				THE STRANGER
		Much obliged.

He looks back at the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		I like your style, Dude.

THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

				DUDE
		Well I like your style too, man.  
		Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

				THE STRANGER
		Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.  
		D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how 
out of place the cowpoke is.

				DUDE
		The fuck are you talking about?

The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the 
bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Okay, have it your way.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.

				THE STRANGER
		Take it easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Thanks man.

He is gone.  "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an 
offscreen voice, breaking the spell:

				VOICE
		Dude!  Dude!

THE DUDE LOOKS:

Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, 
beckoning.

MAUDE'S LOFT

She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just 
cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the 
		doctor.

				DUDE
		No it's fine, really, uh--

				MAUDE
		Do you have any news regarding my 
		father's money?

				DUDE
		I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta 
		respecfully, 69 you know, tender my 
		resignation on that matter, 'cause 
		it looks like your mother really was 
		kidnapped after all.

				MAUDE
		She most certainly was not!

				DUDE
		Hey man, why don't you fucking listen 
		occasionally?  You might learn 
		something.  Now I got--

				MAUDE
		And please don't call her my mother.

				DUDE
		Now I got--

				MAUDE
		She is most definitely the perpetrator 
		and not the victim.

				DUDE
		I'm telling you, I got definitive 
		evidence--

				MAUDE
		From who?

				DUDE
		The main guy, Dieter--

				MAUDE
		Dieter Hauff?

				DUDE
		Well--yeah, I guess--

				MAUDE
		Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

				DUDE
		Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, 
		you know him?

				MAUDE
		Dieter has been on the fringes of--
		well, of everything in L.A., for 
		about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.  
		Under 'Autobahn.'

The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.

				MAUDE
		That was his group--they released 
		one album in the mid-seventies.

The Dude stops between two albums.

				DUDE
		Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

				MAUDE
		Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their 
		music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is 
the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a 
picture

OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW 
SLICKED-

back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are 
wearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name 
under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of 
nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

				MAUDE
		Is he pretending to be the abductor?

				DUDE
		Well...yeah--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, you don't really  
		kidnap someone that you're acquainted 
		with.  You can't get away with it if 
		the hostage knows who you are.

				DUDE
		Well yeah...I know that.

				MAUDE
		So Dieter has the money?

				DUDE
		Well, no, not exactly.  It's a 
		complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.  
		Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to 
		keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands 
		in old Duder's--

				MAUDE
		Do you still have that doctor's 
		number?

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, really, I don't even have 
		the bruise any more, I--

She is scribbling.

				MAUDE
		Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be 
		responsible for any delayed after-
		effects.

				DUDE
		Delayed after-eff--

				MAUDE
		I want you to see him immediately.

She is picking up a telephone.

				MAUDE
		I'll see if he's available.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE

His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of 
"Comin' Up Around the Bend."

Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, 
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a 
moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His 
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the 
Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

				VOICE
		Could you slide your shorts down 
		please, Mr.  Lebowski?

The Dude's eyes open.

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

				VOICE
		I understand sir.  Could you slide 
		your shorts down please?

DUDE'S CAR

The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude 
is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and, noticing something, looks again.

HIS POV

A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.

THE DUDE

His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint 
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it 
out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering 
sparks.

DUDE'S CROTCH

The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. 
The Dude screams.

THE STREET

The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off 
to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes 
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone 
poll.

INSIDE THE CAR

The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, 
and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which 
also won't open.

				DUDE
		Fuck Me.

But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  
the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion 
and back cushion.

				DUDE
		Fuckola, man.

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   
There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper 
sticking out from between the cushions.

The Dude pulls it out.

It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and 
dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, 
Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana 
Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some 
handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled 
in red throughout.

CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage 
in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, 
is performing a dance moderne.

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice 
hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse 
audience.

				WALTER
		He lives in North Hollywood on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DUDE
		The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

				WALTER
		Near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DONNY
		Those are good burgers, Walter.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid 
		is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his 
		father is--are you ready for this?--
		Arthur Digby Sellers.

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

				WALTER
		Who the f--have you ever heard of a 
		little show called Branded, Dude?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		All but one man died?  There at Bitter 
		Creek?

				DUDE
		Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show 
		Walter, so what?

				WALTER
		Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 
		156 episodes, Dude.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		The bulk of the series.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Not exactly a lightweight.

				DUDE
		No.

				WALTER
		And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

				DUDE
		Uh.

				WALTER
		Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out 
		there after the, uh, the.

He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

				WALTER
		What have you.  We'll, uh--

				DONNY
		We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, 
		brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.  
		We'll get that fucking money, if he 
		hasn't spent it already.  Million 
		fucking clams. And yes, we'll be 
		near the, uh--some burgers, some 
		beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking 
		troubles are over, Dude.

RESIDENTIAL AREA

The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated 
house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in 
front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.

				DUDE
		Fuck me, man!  That kid's already 
		spent all the money!

				WALTER
		Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's 
		still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, 
		depending on the options.  Wait in 
		the car, Donny.

THE FRONT DOOR

Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish 
woman.

				WOMAN
		Jace?

				WALTER
		Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter 
		Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this 
		is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WOMAN
		Jace.

				WALTER
		May we uh, we wanted to talk about 
		little Larry.  May we come in?

				WOMAN
		Jace.

They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as 
Pilar

CALLS UP THE STAIRS:

				PILAR
		Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and 
nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man 
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its 
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct 
hisses in and out.

				WALTER
		That's him, Dude.

				VIVA VOCE
		And a good day to you, sir.

				PILAR
		See down, please.

				WALTER
		Thank you, ma'am.

He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered 
voice, to Pilar:

				WALTER
		Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

				PILAR
		No, no.  He has healt' problems.

				WALTER
		Uh-huh.

HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:

				WALTER
		I just want to say, sir, that we're 
		both enormous--on a personal level, 
		Branded, especially the early 
		episodes, has been a source of, uh, 
		inspir---

There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year-
old, looks at the two men.

				PILAR
		See down, Sweetie.  These are the 
		policeman--

				WALTER
		No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the 
		impression that we're police exactly.  
		We're hoping that it will not be 
		necessary to call the police.

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:

				WALTER
		But that is up to little Larry here.  
		Isn't it, Larry?

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out 
the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out 
at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

Larry does not respond.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Look, man, did you--

				WALTER
		Dude, please!. . .  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Just ask him if he--ask him about 
		the car, man!

Walter is still holding out the homework.

				WALTER
		Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Is the car out front yours?

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		We know it's his fucking homework, 
		Walter!  Where's the fucking money, 
		you little brat?

Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework 
extended towards him.

				WALTER
		Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard 
		of Vietnam?

				DUDE
		Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

				WALTER
		You're going to enter a world of 
		pain, son.  We know that this is 
		your homework.  We know you stole a 
		car--

				DUDE
		And the fucking money!

				WALTER
		And the fucking money.  And we know 
		that this is your homework, Larry.

No answer.

				WALTER
		You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

FINALLY, IN DISGUST:

				WALTER
		Ah, this is pointless.

As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

				WALTER
		All right, Plan B.  You might want 
		to watch out the front window there, 
		Larry.

He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to 
follow him.

				WALTER
		This is what happens when you FUCK a 
		STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

OUTSIDE

Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like 
an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, 
the Dude, who follows:

				WALTER
		Fucking language problem, Dude.

He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes 
out a tire iron.

				WALTER
		Maybe he'll understand this.

He is walking over to the Corvette.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which 
shatters.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.

				WALTER
		THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A 
		STRANGER IN THE ASS!

Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs 
bark.

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER 
		IN THE ASS!

CRASH!

A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over 
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of 
the crowbar.

				MAN
		WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!

He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

				MAN
		I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!

Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

				WALTER
		Hunh?

The man looks about, wildly.

				MAN
		I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR 
		FUCKEEN CAR!

He runs over to the Dude's car.

				DUDE
		No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

CRASH!  CRASH!

				MAN
		I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

CRASH!

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

INSIDE THE CAR

Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

					  ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

THE DUDE'S CAR

We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as 
it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows.

The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 
'on In-and-Out Burgers.

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four 
into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

				DUDE
		I accept your apology. . . No I, I 
		just want to handle it myself from 
		now on. . . No.  That has nothing to 
		do with it. . . .Yes, it made it 
		home, I'm calling from home.  No, 
		Walter, it didn't look like Larry 
		was about to crack.

He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair 
that stands nearby.

				DUDE
		Well that's your perception. . . 
		Well you're right, Walter, and the 
		unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND 
		LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, 
		I'll be at practice.

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into 
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced 
against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when 
the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the 
floor.

				DUDE
		Huh?

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, 
kicking the chair away.

				WOO
		Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
		Treehorn wants to see you.

				BLOND MAN
		And we know which Lebowski you are, 
		Lebowski.

				WOO
		Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk 
		to the deadbeat Lebowski.

				BLOND MAN
		You're not dealing with morons here.

BLACKNESS

Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is 
a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her 
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a 
beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

MALIBU BEACH

A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried 
hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual 
attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in 
nightmarish slow motion.

WIDER

It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing 
kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.

In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  
into darkness, descends into light, rises again.

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach 
light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants 
and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the 
neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and 
disappears.

				MAN
		Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm 
		Jackie Treehorn.

INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE

The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.

				DUDE
		This is quite a pad you got here, 
		man.  Completely unspoiled.

				TREEHORN
		What's your drink, Dude?

				DUDE
		White Russian, thanks.  How's the 
		smut business, Jackie?

				TREEHORN
		I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in 
		publishing, entertainment, political 
		advocacy, and--

				DUDE
		Which one was Logjammin'?

				TREEHORN
		Regrettably, it's true, standards 
		have fallen in adult entertainment.  
		It's video, Dude.  Now that we're 
		competing with the amateurs, we can't 
		afford to invest that little extra 
		in story, production value, feeling.

He taps his forehead with one finger.

				TREEHORN
		People forget that the brain is the 
		biggest erogenous zone--

				DUDE
		On you, maybe.

He hands him the drink.

				TREEHORN
		Of course, you do get the good with 
		the bad.  The new technology permits 
		us to do exciting things with 
		interactive erotic software.  Wave 
		of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off 
		manually.

				TREEHORN
		Of course you do.  I can see you're 
		anxious for me to get to the point.  
		Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

				DUDE
		I thought you might know, man.

				TREEHORN
		Me?  How would I know?  The only 
		reason she ran off was to get away 
		from her rather sizable debt to me.

				DUDE
		But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Treehorn waves this off.

				TREEHORN
		I've heard the kidnapping story, so 
		save it.  I know you're mixed up in 
		all this, Dude, and I don't care 
		what you're trying to take off her 
		husband.  That's your business.  All 
		I'm saying is, I want mine.

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, right man, there are 
		many facets to this, uh, you know, 
		many interested parties.  If I can 
		find your money, man-- what's in it 
		for the Dude?

				TREEHORN
		Of course, there's that to discuss.  
		Refill?

				DUDE
		Does the Pope shit in the woods?

				TREEHORN
		Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

				DUDE
		Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way 
		you do business.  Your money is being 
		held by a kid named Larry Sellers.  
		He lives in North Hollywood, on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.  
		A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure 
		your goons'll be able to get it off 
		him, mean he's only fifteen and he's 
		flunking social studies.  So if you'll 
		just write me a check for my ten per 
		cent. . . of half a million. . . 
		fifty grand.

He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.

				DUDE
		I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you 
		mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.

				TREEHORN
		A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your 
		idea of a joke?

Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on 
either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking 
grimly down at the Dude.

				DUDE
		No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's 
		got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just 
		wanted a car.  All the Dude ever 
		wanted. . . was his rug back. . . 
		not greedy. . . it really.

He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  
Tied the room together.

He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.

FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE

Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and 
squishes.

FAST FADE OUT

BLACK

				THE STRANGER'S VOICE
		Darkness warshed over the Dude--
		darker'n a black steer's tookus on a 
		moonless prairie night.  There was 
		no bottom.

We hear a thundering bass.

SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

ANOTHER TITLE CARD:

THE DUDE

AND

MAUDE LEBOWSKI

IN

THIRD TITLE CARD:

GUTTERBALLS

The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked 
by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  
into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  
"Just Dropped In."

The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable 
repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light 
as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing 
operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an 
armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, 
and holds a trident.

The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps 
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- 
skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs 
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the 
end.

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their 
legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, 
the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face 
down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little 
ball-guide arrows zipping by.

The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so 
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing 
chorines.

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so 
that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward 
and his forward momentum blows back his hair.

Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, 
are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  
and rush on into black.

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless 
woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three 
men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool 
of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding 
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the 
advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of 
car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with 
flashing gumballs pulls up.

SQUAD CAR

The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the 
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

				DUDE
		He was innocent.  Not a charge was 
		true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

CHIEF'S OFFICE

The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces 
off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.

His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through 
it with disgusted incredulity.

				CHIEF
		This is your only I.D.?

He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
				DUDE
		I know my rights.

				CHIEF
		You don't know shit, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I 
		want Bill Kunstler.

				CHIEF
		What are you, some kind of sad-assed 
		refugee from the fucking sixties?

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to 
		eject you from his garden party, 
		that you were drunk and abusive.

				DUDE
		That guy treats women like objects, 
		man.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in 
		this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw 
		shit.  We got a nice quiet beach 
		community here, and I aim to keep it 
		nice and quiet.  So let me make 
		something plain.  I don't like you 
		sucking around bothering our citizens, 
		Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
		off name, I don't like your jerk-off 
		face, I don't like your jerk- off 
		behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
		off --do I make myself clear?

The Dude stares.

				DUDE
		I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It 
hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee 
splashing everywhere.

The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

				DUDE
		--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

The Chief slaps him twice.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts 
kicking at him.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep 
		your ugly fucking goldbricking ass 
		out of my beach community!

CAB

The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks 
with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his 
face and scalp.

"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.

DUDE'S POV

The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds 
under a knit cap.

				DUDE
		Jesus, man, can you change the 
		station?

				DRIVER
		Fuck you man!  You don't like my 
		fucking music, get your own fucking 
		cab!

				DUDE
		I've had a--

				DRIVER
		I pull over and kick your ass out, 
		man!

				DUDE
		--had a rough night, and I hate the 
		fucking Eagles, man--

				DRIVER
		That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

THE STREET

The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, 
oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.

INSIDE THE OTHER CAR

It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and 
badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a 
dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a 
kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

THE FOOTWELL

On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright 
red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.

Five more toes.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed 
to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.

				DUDE
		Jesus.

The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, 
upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

Quiet.

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.

The Dude cringes.

Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Maude?

She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.

				MAUDE
		Love me.

The Dude is stupefied.

				DUDE
		That's my robe.

					 THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:

BLACK

After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the 
blackness:

				MAUDE
		Tell me a little about yourself, 
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting 
himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness 
except for the glowing tip of the joint.

				DUDE
		I was, uh, one of the authors of the 
		Port Huron Statement.--The original 
		Port Huron Statement.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Not the compromised second draft.  
		And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the 
		Seattle Seven?

				MAUDE
		Mmnun.

Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie 
next to each other in bed.

				DUDE
		And then. . . let's see, I uh--music 
		business briefly.

				MAUDE
		Oh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed 
		of Sound Tour.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Bunch of assholes.  And then, you 
		know, little of this, little of that. 
		My career's, uh, slowed down a bit 
		lately.

				MAUDE
		What do you do for fun?

				DUDE
		Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.  
		Drive around.  The occasional acid 
		flashback.

He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a 
pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each 
kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep 
her pelvis raised.

				MAUDE
		What happened to your house?

				DUDE
		Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.  
		Wanted to save the finder's fee.

				MAUDE
		Finder's fee?

				DUDE
		He thought I had your father's money, 
		so he got me out of the way while he 
		looked for it.

				MAUDE
		It's not my father's money, it's the 
		Foundation's.  Why did he think you 
		had it?  And who does?

				DUDE
		Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.  
		Real fucking brat.

He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey--

				DUDE
		It's a complicated case, Maude.  
		Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately 
		I've been adhering to a pretty strict, 
		uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, 
		you know, limber.  I'm real fucking 
		close to your father's money, real 
		fucking close.  It's just--

				MAUDE
		I keep telling you, it's the 
		Foundation's money.  Father doesn't 
		have any.

				DUDE
		Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

				MAUDE
		No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

				DUDE
		But your father--he runs stuff, he--

				MAUDE
		We did let Father run one of the 
		companies, briefly, but he didn't do 
		very well at it.

				DUDE
		But he's--

				MAUDE
		He helps administer the charities 
		now, and I give him a reasonable 
		allowance.  He has no money of his 
		own.  I know how he likes to present 
		himself; Father's weakness is vanity.  
		Hence the slut.

				DUDE
		Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is 
		that yoga?

Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees 
pulled in.

				MAUDE
		It increases the chances of 
		conception.

The Dude spits some White Russian.

				DUDE
		Increases?

				MAUDE
		Well yes, what did you think this 
		was all about?  Fun and games?

				DUDE
		Well...no, of course not--

				MAUDE
		I want a child.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.  
		In fact I don't want the father to 
		be someone I have to see socially, 
		or who'll have any interest in rearing 
		the child himself.

				DUDE
		Huh...

Something occurs to him.

				DUDE
		So...that doctor.

				MAUDE
		Exactly.  What happened to your face?  
		Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is 
absent.

				DUDE
		No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.  
		A real reactionary. . . So your 
		father. . . Oh man, I get it!

				MAUDE
		What?

The Dude is leaving the bedroom.

				DUDE
		Yeah, my thinking about the case, 
		man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.  
		Your father--

LIVING ROOM

The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

				PHONE VOICE
		This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; 
		leave a message after the beep.

FROM THE BEDROOM:

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		What're you talking about?

Beep.

				DUDE
		Walter, if you're there, pick up the 
		fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, 
		this is an emergency.  I'm not--

				WALTER
		Dude?

				DUDE
		Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I 
		need you to come pick me up--

				WALTER
		I can't drive, Dude, it's erev 
		shabbas.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm 
		not even supposed to pick up the 
		phone, unless it's an emergency.

				DUDE
		It is a fucking emergency.

				WALTER
		I understand.  That's why I picked 
		up the phone.

				DUDE
		THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, 
		just call Donny then, and ask him to--

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

				DUDE
		WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA 
		GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR 
		I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		Jeffrey?

THE DUDE

He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His 
attention is caught by something down the street.

HIS POV

A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the 
shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.

THE DUDE

Striding purposefully down the street.

HIS POV

The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's 
ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More 
whines and coughs; no start.

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a 
newspaper, which he holds before his face.

THE DUDE

As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's 
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  
He is revved with nervous energy.

				DUDE
		Get out of that fucking car, man!

The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's 
movement as he gets out.

The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a 
short fringe and a mustache.

The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, 
		man!

				MAN
		Relax, man!  No physical harm 
		intended!

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you?  Why've you 
		been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

				MAN
		Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

The Dude is stunned.

				DUDE
		Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

				MAN
		Irish m--What the fuck are you talking 
		about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a 
		private snoop!  Like you, man!

				DUDE
		Huh?

				DA FINO
		A dick, man!  And let me tell you 
		something: I dig your work. Playing 
		one side against the other--in bed 
		with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

				DUDE
		I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay 
		away from my fucking lady friend, 
		man.

				DA FINO
		Hey hey, I'm not messing with your 
		special lady--

				DUDE
		She's not my special lady, she's my 
		fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping 
		her conceive, man!

				DA FINO
		Hey, man, I'm not--

				DUDE
		Who're you working for?  Lebowski?  
		Jackie Treehorn?

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.

				DUDE
		The?  Who the fff--

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.  It's a wandering 
		daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.  
		Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.  
		Her parents want her back.

He is fumbling in his wallet.

				DA FINO
		See?

The Dude looks at the picture.

It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but 
fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and 
straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

				DUDE
		Jesus fucking Christ.

				DA FINO
		Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

He is holding out another picture.

The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.  
The family farm.

A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat 
snow-swept landscape.

Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her 
homesick.

				DUDE
		Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on 
		the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

He hands back the picture.

She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's 
definitely not around.

				DA FINO
		Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

				DUDE
		Yeah, it sucks.

				DA FINO
		Well maybe you and me could pool our 
		resources--trade information--
		professional courtesy--compeers, you 
		know--

We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an 
approaching car.

				DUDE
		Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.  
		And stay away from my special la--
		from my fucking lady friend.

The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its 
passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and 
yapping.

DENNY'S

Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in 
black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde 
hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless 
tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, 
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and 
arms.

Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-
swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of 
the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   
They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad 
and pen.

				WAITRESS
		You folks ready?

The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.

				DIETER
		I haff lingenberry pancakes.

				KIEFFER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

				FRANZ
		Sree picks in blanket.

The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.

				DIETER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

WALTER'S CAR

Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the 
Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from 
the back seat.

				DUDE
		I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  
		We fucked up his pay-off.  And got 
		the kidnappers all pissed off, and 
		the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, 
		but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

				WALTER
		Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, 
		uh.

				DUDE
		I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
		up, then why does he still leave me 
		in charge of getting back his wife?  
		Because he fucking doesn't want her 
		back, man!  He's had enough!  He no 
		longer digs her!  It's all a show!  
		But then, why didn't he give a shit 
		about his million bucks?  I mean, he 
		knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, 
		but he never asked for it back.

				WALTER
		What's your point, Dude?

				DUDE
		His million bucks was never in it, 
		man!  There was no money in that 
		briefcase!  He was hoping they'd 
		kill her!  You throw out a ringer 
		for a ringer!

				WALTER
		Yeah?

				DUDE
		Shit yeah!

				WALTER
		Okay, but how does all this add up 
		to an emergency?

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		I'm saying, I see what you're getting 
		at, Dude, he kept the money, but my 
		point is, here we are, it's shabbas, 
		the sabbath, which I'm allowed to 
		break only if it's a matter of life 
		and death--

				DUDE
		Walter, come off it.  You're not 
		even fucking Jewish, you're--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?

				DUDE
		You're fucking Polish Catholic--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?  
		I converted when I married Cynthia!  
		Come on, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, and you were--

				WALTER
		You know this!

				DUDE
		And you were divorced five fucking 
		years ago.

				WALTER
		Yeah?  What do you think happens 
		when you get divorced?  You turn in 
		your library card?  Get a new driver's 
		license?  Stop being Jewish?

				DUDE
		This driveway.

AS HE TURNS:

				WALTER
		I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

				DUDE
		It's just part of your whole sick 
		Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her 
		fucking dog.  Going to her fucking 
		synagogue.  You're living in the 
		fucking past.

				WALTER
		Three thousand years of beautiful 
		tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
		YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE 
		PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell 
		happened?

He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where 
Walter is looking.

THE LEBOWSKI MANSION

Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he 
and the Dude get out.

Both are gaping off at the front lawn.

				WALTER
		Jesus Christ.

THEIR POV

Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a 
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a 
palm trunk.

TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY

Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, 
naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing 
into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters 
in from a boom box by the pool.

Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and 
straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the 
length of the hall.

				BRANDT
		He can't see you, Dude.

We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to 
the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its 
tail.

				DUDE
		Where'd she been?

				BRANDT
		Visiting friends of hers in Palm 
		Springs.  Just picked up and left, 
		never bothered to tell us.

				DUDE
		But I guess she told Dieter.

				WALTER
		Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped 
		her.

				BRANDT
		Who's this gentleman, Dude?

				WALTER
		Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

				BRANDT
		You shouldn't go in there, Dude!  
		He's very angry!

BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

THE GREAT ROOM

The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His 
wheelchair hums as he spins it around.

				LEBOWSKI
			(bitterly)
		Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

				DUDE
		Where's the money, Lebowski?

				WALTER
		A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY 
		LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE 
		SCUM, MAN!

The dog yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Who the hell is he?

				WALTER
		I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy 
		who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY 
		GOLDBRICKING ASS!

				DUDE
		We know the briefcase was empty, 
		man.  We know you kept the million  
		bucks yourself.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well, you have your story, I have 
		mine.  I say I entrusted the money 
		to you, and you stole it.

				WALTER
		AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING 
		YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

				DUDE
		You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped 
		and you could use it as a pretext to 
		make some money disappear.  All you 
		needed was a sap to pin it on, and 
		you'd just met me.  You thought, 
		hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone 
		the square community won't give a 
		shit about.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well?  Aren't you?

				DUDE
		Well. . . yeah.

				LEBOWSKI
		All right, get out.  Both of you.

				WALTER
		Look at that fucking phony, Dude!  
		Pretending to be a fucking 
		millionaire!

				LEBOWSKI
		I said out.  Now.

				WALTER
		Let me tell you something else.  
		I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, 
		and this guy is a fake.  A fucking 
		goldbricker.

He is crossing to Lebowski.

				WALTER
		This guy fucking walks.  I've never 
		been more certain of anything in my 
		life!

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me, mister!

Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski 
out of the wheelchair by his armpits.

				WALTER
		Walk, you fucking phony!

The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing 
the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps 
and yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Put me down, you son of a bitch!

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		It's all over, man!  We call your 
		fucking bluff!

				DUDE
		WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S 
		CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!

				WALTER
		Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!
		ACHTUNG, BABY!!

He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the 
floor, weeping.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				LEBOWSKI
			(sobbing)
		You're bullies!  Cowards, both of 
		you!

Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the 
floor.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				DUDE
		He can't walk, Walter!

				WALTER
		Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		You monsters!

				DUDE
		Help me put him back in his chair.

Walter moves to comply.

				WALTER
		Shit, sorry man.

THROUGH HIS TEARS:

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me!  You bullies!  
		You and these women!  You won't leave 
		a man his fucking balls!

				DUDE
		Walter, you fuck!

				WALTER
		Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I 
		wouldn't've done it if I knew he was 
		a fucking crybaby.

				DUDE
		We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer 
and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and 
batting the dog away.

				DUDE
		There ya go.  Sorry man.

Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

TEN PINS

Scattered at the cut.

DUDE AND WALTER

Each with a beer at the scoring table.

				WALTER
		Sure you'll see some tank battles.  
		But fighting in desert is very 
		different from fighting in canopy 
		jungle.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war 
		whereas, uh, this thing should be a 
		fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an 
		M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking 
		tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, 
		eyeball to eyeball.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		That's fuckin' combat.  The man in 
		the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy 
		fuckin' adversary.

				DONNY
		Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch 
		of fig-eaters with towels on their 
		heads tryin' to find reverse on a 
		Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

				VOICE
		HEY!

The Dude and Walter look.

Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is 
restrained by O'Brien.

				QUINTANA
		What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!

Walter looks at him innocently.

				QUINTANA
		What is this bullshit, man?  I don't 
		fucking care!  It don't matter to 
		Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!  
		You might fool the fucks in the league 
		office, but you don't fool Jesus!  
		It's bush league psych-out stuff!  
		Laughable, man!  I would've fucked 
		you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck 
		you in the ass next Wednesday instead!

				QUINTANA

He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him 
away.

				QUINTANA
		You got a date Wednesday, man!

Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his 
shades, watch him go.

				WALTER
		He's cracking.

BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT

Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding 
his leatherette ball satchel.

				WALTER
		A tree of life, Dude.  To all who 
		cling to it.

They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming 
from a boom box.

REVERSE

Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in 
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them 
orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been 
put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's 
creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, 
parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning 
car.

				DUDE
		They finally did it.  They killed my 
		fucking car.

				DIETER
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

				FRANZ
		Ja, it seems you forgot our little 
		deal, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		You don't have the fucking girl, 
		dipshits.  We know you never did.  
		So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

				DUDE

The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in 
German.  Under his breath:

				DONNY
		Are these the Nazis, Walter?

Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three 
men:

				WALTER
		They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to 
		be afraid of.

The Germans stop conferring.

				DIETER
		Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat 
		money or vee fuck you up.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee 
		sreaten you.

He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the 
firelight.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.

Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

				WALTER
		There's no ransom if you don't have 
		a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom 
		is.  Those are the fucking rules.

				DIETER
		Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

				WALTER
		NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
		OF- BITCHES--

				KIEFFER
		His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She 
		sought we'd be getting million 
		dollars!  Iss not fair!

				WALTER
		Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST 
		HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF 
		FUCKING CRYBABIES?!

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, 
		there never was any money.  The big 
		Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, 
		man, so take it up with him.

				WALTER
		AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

The Germans confer again, in German.

Donny is visibly frightened.

				DONNY
		Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:

				WALTER
		They won't hurt us, Donny.  These 
		men are cowards.

THE CONFERENCE ENDS:

				DIETER
		Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on 
		you und vee call it eefen.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.

The Dude is digging into his pocket.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter, we're ending this 
		thing cheap.

Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.

				WALTER
		What's mine is mine.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter!.

Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:

				DUDE
		Four dollars here!

He inspects the change in his palm.

				DUDE
		Almost five!

				DONNY
			(tremulously)
		I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

				WALTER
			(grimly)
		What's mine is mine.

With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR 
		MONEY!

				WALTER
			(coolly)
		Come and get it.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!

				WALTER
		Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

				WALTER
		Show me what you got.  Nihilist.  
		Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

In a rage, Dieter charges.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

WALTER

hurls his leather satchel.

KIEFFER

Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling 
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.

He falls back, his uzi clattering away.

WALTER

twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in 
both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes 
on Dieter's ear.

DUDE

He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate 
kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives 
a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his 
arms up, evading the kicks.

WALTER

His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his 
saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.

Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter 
screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws 
clamped.

THE SABER

Dieter drops it.

DUDE

Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.

WALTER

still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and 
Dieter's separate.

DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I 
		BELIEF IN NUSSING!

Walter spits his ear into his face.

DUDE

The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to 
establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.

				FRANZ
		VEAKLING!

WALTER

draws back his fist.

				DIETER
		NUSSING!

				WALTER
		ANTI-SEMITE!

Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter 
for the count.

DUDE AND FRANZ

With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to 
charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.

As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  
frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music 
screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is 
quiet.

All quiet.

Walter, panting, looks around.

				WALTER
		We've got a man down, Dude.

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to 
Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.

The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.

				DUDE
		Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

				WALTER
		No Dude.

				DUDE
		They shot Donny!

Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to 
Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.

				WALTER
		There weren't any shots.

				DUDE
		Then what's...

				WALTER
		It's a heart attack.

				DUDE
		Wha.

				WALTER
		Call the medics, Dude.

				DUDE
		Wha. . . Donny--

				WALTER
		Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping 
		blood.  Might pass out.

The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand 
on Donny's shoulder.

				WALTER
		Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing 
		fine.  We got help choppering in.

FADE OUT

HOLD IN BLACK

THE DUDE AND WALTER

---

They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript 
waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off 
those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He 
eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's 
army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.

				MAN
		Hello, gentlemen.  You are the 
		bereaved?

				DUDE
		Yeah man.

				MAN
		Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet 
		you.

				DUDE
		Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Walter Sobchak.

				DUDE
		The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

				DONNELLY
		Excuse me?

				DUDE
		Nothing.

				DONNELLY
		Yes.  I understand you're taking 
		away the remains.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

				DONNELLY
		We have the urn.

He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters 
to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.

				DONNELLY
		And I assume this is credit card?

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk 
to whomever wants to take it.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit 
halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head 
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a 
mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards 
Donnelly, pointing.

				WALTER
		What's this?

				DONNELLY
		That is for the urn.

				WALTER
		Don't need it.  We're scattering the 
		ashes.

				DONNELLY
		Yes, so we were informed.  However, 
		we must of course transmit the remains 
		to you in a receptacle.

				WALTER
		This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

				DONNELLY
		Yes sir.  It is our most modestly 
		priced receptacle.

				DUDE
		Well can we--

				WALTER
		A hundred and eighty dollars?!

				DONNELLY
		They range up to three thousand.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but we're--

				DUDE
		Can we just rent it from you?

				DONNELLY
		Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental 
		house.

				WALTER
		We're scattering the fucking ashes!

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T 
		MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

				DONNELLY
		Sir, please lower your voice--

				DUDE
		Hey man, don't you have something 
		else you could put it in?

				DONNELLY
		That is our most modestly priced 
		receptacle.

				WALTER
		GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND 
		HERE?!

POINT DUME -- DAY

It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk 
towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is 
one lonely car, Walter's.

Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic 
lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly 
for a beat.  Finally:

				WALTER
		I'll say a few words.

The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears 
his throat.

				WALTER
		Donny was a good bowler, and a good 
		man.  He was. . . He was one of us.  
		He was a man who loved the outdoors, 
		and bowling, and as a surfer explored 
		the beaches of southern California 
		from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he 
		was an avid bowler.  And a good 
		friend.  He died--he died as so many 
		of his generation, before his time.  
		In your wisdom you took him, Lord.  
		As you took so many bright flowering 
		young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc 
		and Hill 364.  These young men gave 
		their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny 
		who. . . who loved bowling.

Walter clears his throat.

				WALTER
		And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, 
		in accordance with what we think   
		your dying wishes might well have 
		been, we commit your mortal remains 
		to the bosom of.

Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.

				WALTER
		the Pacific Ocean, which you loved 
		so well.

AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:

				WALTER
		Goodnight, sweet prince.

The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing 
just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, 
frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.

				WALTER
		Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.

				WALTER
		Goddamn wind.

Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping 
Walter's hands away.

				DUDE
		Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking 
		asshole!

				WALTER
		Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

The Dude is near tears.

				DUDE
		You make everything a fucking 
		travesty!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

				DUDE
		What about that shit about Vietnam!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		What the fuck does Vietnam have to 
		do with anything!  What the fuck 
		were you talking about?!

Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost 
lost.

				WALTER
		Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		You're a fuck, Walter!

He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then 
wraps his arms around the Dude.

				WALTER
		Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING

We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow 
through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  
They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his 
bowling shirt.

BAR AREA

The Dude walks up to the bar.

				DUDE
		Two oat sodas, Gary.

				GARY
		Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

				DUDE
		Thanks, man.

				GARY
		Sorry to hear about Donny.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you 
		eat the bear, and, uh.

"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The 
Stranger ambles up to the bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Howdy do, Dude.

				DUDE
		Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered 
		if I'd see you again.

				THE STRANGER
		Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things 
		been goin'?

				DUDE
		Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, 
		ups and downs.

The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure, I gotcha.

The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

				DUDE
		Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I 
		gotta get back.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know 
		that you will.

THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:

				DUDE
		Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude 
		abides.

Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

				THE STRANGER
		The Dude abides.

He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into 
the camera.

				THE STRANGER
		I don't know about you, but I take 
		comfort in that.  It's good knowin' 
		he's out there, the Dude, takin' her 
		easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I 
		sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, 
		that about does her, wraps her all 
		up.  Things seem to've worked out 
		pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, 
		and it was a purt good story, dontcha 
		think?   Made me laugh to beat the 
		band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I 
		didn't like seein' Donny go. But 
		then, happen to know that there's a 
		little Lebowski on the way.  I guess 
		that's the way the whole durned human 
		comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, 
		down through the generations, westward 
		the wagons, across the sands a time 
		until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' 
		again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed 
		yourselves.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull 
back.

				THE STRANGER
		Catch ya further on down the trail.

As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his 
voice fades:

				THE STRANGER
		...Say friend, ya got any more a 
		that good sarsaparilla?...
THE BIG LEBOWSKI

We are floating up a steep scrubby slope.  We hear male voices 
gently singing "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and a deep, affable, 
Western-accented voice--Sam Elliot's, perhaps:

				VOICE-OVER
		A way out west there was a fella, 
		fella I want to tell you about, fella 
		by the name of Jeff Lebowski.  At 
		least, that was the handle his lovin' 
		parents gave him, but he never had 
		much use for it himself.  This 
		Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.  
		Now, Dude, that's a name no one would 
		self-apply where I come from.  But 
		then, there was a lot about the Dude 
		that didn't make a whole lot of sense 
		to me.  And a lot about where he 
		lived, like- wise.  But then again, 
		maybe that's why I found the place 
		s'durned innarestin'.

We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at 
twilight stretches out before us.

				VOICE-OVER
		They call Los Angeles the City of 
		Angels.  I didn't find it to be that 
		exactly, but I'll allow as there are 
		some nice folks there.  'Course, I 
		can't say I seen London, and I never 
		been to France, and I ain't never 
		seen no queen in her damn undies as 
		the fella says.  But I'll tell you 
		what, after seeing Los Angeles and 
		thisahere story I'm about to unfold--
		wal, I guess I seen somethin' ever' 
		bit as stupefyin' as ya'd see in any 
		a those other places, and in English 
		too, so I can die with a smile on my 
		face without feelin' like the good 
		Lord gypped me.

INTERIOR   RALPH'S

It is late, the supermarket all but deserted.  We are tracking 
in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the 
dairy case.  He is the Dude.  His rumpled look and relaxed 
manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep.

He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their 
expiration dates.

				VOICE-OVER
		Now this story I'm about to unfold 
		took place back in the early nineties--
		just about the time of our conflict 
		with Sad'm and the Eye-rackies.  I 
		only mention it 'cause some- times 
		there's a man--I won't say a hee-ro, 
		'cause what's a hee-ro?--but sometimes 
		there's a man.

The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of 
milk.  He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs.

				VOICE-OVER
		And I'm talkin' about the Dude here-- 
		sometimes there's a man who, wal, 
		he's the man for his time'n place, 
		he fits right in there--and that's 
		the Dude, in Los Angeles.

CHECKOUT GIRL

She waits, arms folded.  A small black-and white TV next to 
her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with 
helicopter rotors spinning behind him.

				GEORGE BUSH
		This aggression will not stand. . . 
		This will not stand!

The Dude, peeking over his shades, scribbles something at 
the little customer's lectern.  Milk beads his mustache.

				VOICE-OVER
		...and even if he's a lazy man, and 
		the Dude was certainly that--quite 
		possibly the laziest in Los Angeles 
		County.

The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and 
is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents.

				VOICE-OVER
		...which would place him high in the 
		runnin' for laziest worldwide--but 
		sometimes there's a man. . . sometimes 
		there's a man.

EXTERIOR  RALPH'S

Long shot of the glowing Ralph's.  There are only two or 
three cars parked in the huge lot.

				VOICE-OVER
		Wal, I lost m'train of thought here.  
		But--aw hell, I done innerduced him 
		enough.

The Dude is a small figure walking across the vast lot.  
Next to him walks a Mexican carry-out boy in a red apron and 
cap carrying a small brown bag holding the quart of milk.  
The two men's footsteps echo in the still of the night.

After a beat of walking the Dude offhandedly points.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S HOUSE

The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow 
court.  He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small 
leatherette satchel in the other.  He awkwardly hugs the 
grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door.

INSIDE

The Dude enters and flicks on a light.

His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit.  
We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, 
his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body.  
Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece 
of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a 
hole.

The Dude is propelled across the bedroom and on into a small 
bathroom, the satchel once again taking away a piece of 
doorframe.  His head is plunged into the toilet.  The paper 
bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet 
rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the 
floor.

The Dude blows bubbles.

				VOICE
		We want that money, Lebowski.  Bunny 
		said you were good for it.

Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and 
gasps for air.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

His head is plunged back into the toilet.

				VOICE
		Where's the money, Lebowski!

The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping.

				VOICE
		WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!

				DUDE
		It's uh, it's down there somewhere.  
		Lemme take another look.

His head is plunged back in.

				VOICE
		Don't fuck with us.  If your wife 
		owes money to Jackie Treehorn, that 
		means you owe money to Jackie 
		Treehorn.

The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and 
flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against 
the toilet.

The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand.

Looming over him is a strapping blond man.

Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly 
and walks over to a rug.

				CHINESE MAN
		Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

He starts peeing on the rug.

The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his 
sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Oh, man.  Don't do--

				BLOND MAN
		You see what happens?  You see what 
		happens, Lebowski?

The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses.

				DUDE
		Look, nobody calls me Lebowski.  You 
		got the wrong guy.  I'm the Dude, 
		man.

				BLOND MAN
		Your name is Lebowski.  Your wife is 
		Bunny.

				DUDE
		Bunny?  Look, moron.

He holds up his hands.

				DUDE
		You see a wedding ring?  Does this 
		place look like I'm fucking married?   
		All my plants are dead!

The blond man stoops to unzip the satchel.  He pulls out a 
bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious 
native.

				BLOND MAN
		The fuck is this?

The Dude pats at his pockets, takes out a joint and lights 
it.

				DUDE
		Obviously you're not a golfer.

The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile.

				BLOND MAN
		Woo?

The Chinese man is zipping his fly.

				WOO
		Yeah?

				BLOND MAN
		Wasn't this guy supposed to be a 
		millionaire?

				WOO
		Uh?

They both look around.

				WOO
		Fuck.

				BLOND MAN
		What do you think?

				WOO
		He looks like a fuckin' loser.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger 
and peeks over them.

				DUDE
		Hey.  At least I'm housebroken.

The two men look at each other.  They turn to leave.

				WOO
		Fuckin' waste of time.

The blond man turns testily at the door.

				BLOND MAN
		Thanks a lot, asshole.

						 ON THE DOOR SLAM WE CUT TO:

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins 
flying, bowlers hoisting balls, balls gliding down lanes, 
sliding feet, graceful releases, ball return spinning up a 
ball, fingers sliding into fingerholes, etc.

The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant 
jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike.

A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail 
turns from the strike to walk back to the bench.

				MAN
		Hot damn, I'm throwin' rocks tonight.  
		Mark it, Dude.

We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man 
nursing a large plastic cup of Bud.  He has dark worried 
eyes and a goatee.  Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts.  
He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves 
cut off over an old bowling shirt.  This is Walter.  He 
squints through the smoke from his own cigarette as he 
addresses the Dude at the scoring table.

The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears 
some of its foam on his mustache.

				WALTER
		This was a valued rug.

He elaborately clears his throat.

				WALTER
		This was, uh--

				DUDE
		Yeah man, it really tied the room 
		together--

				WALTER
		This was a valued, uh.

Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter.

				DONNY
		What tied the room together, Dude?

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the story, 
		Donny?

				DONNY
		What--

				WALTER
		Were you listening to the Dude's 
		story?

				DONNY
		I was bowling--

				WALTER
		So you have no frame of reference, 
		Donny.  You're like a child who 
		wanders in in the middle of a movie 
		and wants to know--

				DUDE
		What's your point, Walter?

				WALTER
		There's no fucking reason--here's my 
		point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--

				DONNY
		Yeah Walter, what's your point?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		What's the point of--we all know who 
		was at fault, so what the fuck are 
		you talking about?

				WALTER
		Huh?  No!  What the fuck are you 
		talking--I'm not--we're talking about 
		unchecked aggression here--

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				DUDE
		My rug.

				WALTER
		Forget it, Donny.  You're out of 
		your element.

				DUDE
		This Chinaman who peed on my rug, I 
		can't go give him a bill so what the 
		fuck are you talking about?

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?!  
		This Chinaman is not the issue!  I'm 
		talking about drawing a line in the 
		sand, Dude.  Across this line you do 
		not, uh--and also, Dude, Chinaman is 
		not the preferred, uh. . . Asian- 
		American.  Please.

				DUDE
		Walter, this is not a guy who built 
		the rail- roads, here, this is a guy 
		who peed on my--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you--

				DUDE
		Walter, he peed on my rug--

				DONNY
		He peed on the Dude's rug--

				WALTER
		YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This 
		Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.

				DUDE
		So who--

				WALTER
		Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other 
		Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire.  
		He's gonna be easier to find anyway 
		than these two, uh. these two  . . . 
		And he has the wealth, uh, the 
		resources obviously, and there is no 
		reason, no FUCKING reason, why his 
		wife should go out and owe money and 
		they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		No, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Okay. That, uh.

He elaborately clears his throat.

That rap really tied the room together, did it not?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				DONNY
		And this guy peed on it.

				WALTER
		Donny!  Please!

				DUDE
		Yeah, I could find this Lebowski guy--

				DONNY
		His name is Lebowski?  That's your 
		name, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, this is the guy, this guy should 
		compensate me for the fucking rug.  
		I mean his wife goes out and owes 
		money and they pee on my rug.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right Dude; they pee on 
		your fucking Rug.

CLOSE ON A PLAQUE

We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver 
to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, 
honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR.

Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room 
with a YOUNG MAN.  We hear the two men talk:

				YOUNG MAN
		And this is the study.  You can see 
		the various commendations, honorary 
		degrees, et cetera.

				DUDE
		Yes, uh, very impressive.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please, feel free to inspect them.

				DUDE
		I'm not really, uh.

				YOUNG MAN
		Please!  Please!

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

We are panning the walls, looking at various citations and

certificates unrelated to the ones being discussed offscreen:

				YOUNG MAN
		That's the key to the city of 
		Pasadena, which Mr. Lebowski was 
		given two years ago in recognition 
		of his various civic, uh.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				YOUNG MAN
		That's a Los Angeles Chamber of 
		Commerce Business Achiever award, 
		which is given--not necessarily given 
		every year!  Given only when there's 
		a worthy, somebody especially--

				DUDE
		Hey, is this him with Nancy?

				YOUNG MAN
		That is indeed Mr. Lebowski with the 
		first lady, yes, taken when--

				DUDE
		Lebowski on the right?

				YOUNG MAN
		Of course, Mr. Lebowski on the right, 
		Mrs.  Reagan on the left, taken when--

				DUDE
		He's handicapped, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And 
		this picture was taken when Mrs. 
		Reagan was first lady of the nation, 
		yes, yes? Not of California.

				DUDE
		Far out.

				YOUNG MAN
		And in fact he met privately with 
		the President, though unfortunately 
		there wasn't time for a photo 
		opportunity.

				DUDE
		Nancy's pretty good.

				YOUNG MAN
		Wonderful woman.  We were very--

				DUDE
		Are these.

				YOUNG MAN
		These are Mr. Lebowski's children, 
		so to speak--

				DUDE
		Different mothers, huh?

				YOUNG MAN
		No, they--

				DUDE
		I guess he's pretty, uh, racially 
		pretty cool--

				YOUNG MAN
		They're not his, heh-heh, they're 
		not literally his children; they're 
		the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		inner-city children of promise but 
		without the--

				DUDE
		I see.

				YOUNG MAN
		--without  the means  for higher  
		education, so Mr. Lebowski  has 
		committed  to sending  all of them 
		to college.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  Think he's got room for one 
		more?

				YOUNG MAN
		One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went 
		to college?

				DUDE
		Well, yeah I did, but I spent most 
		of my time occupying various, um, 
		administration buildings--

				YOUNG MAN
		Heh-heh--

				DUDE
		--smoking thai-stick, breaking into 
		the ROTC--

				YOUNG MAN
		Yes, heh--

				DUDE
		--and bowling.  I'll tell you the 
		truth, Brandt, I don't remember most 
		of it.--Jeez!  Fuck me!

Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed 
Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI 
ACHIEVER?  Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we 
realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the 
display is mirrored.

We hear the door open and the whine of a motor.  The Dude, 
wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look.

So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to.  He 
wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin.

Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized 
wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski.

				LEBOWSKI
		Okay sir, you're a Lebowski, I'm a 
		Lebowski, that's terrific, I'm very 
		busy so what can I do for you?

He wheels himself behind a desk.  The Dude sits facing him 
as Brandt withdraws.

				DUDE
		Well sir, it's this rug I have, really 
		tied the room together-

				LEBOWSKI
		You told Brandt on the phone, he 
		told me.  So where do I fit in?

				DUDE
		Well they were looking for you, these 
		two guys, they were trying to--

				LEBOWSKI
		I'll say it again, all right?  You 
		told Brandt.  He told me.  I know 
		what happened. Yes?  Yes?

				DUDE
		So you know they were trying to piss 
		on your rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		You mean, did you personally come 
		and pee on my--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Do you speak English?  Parla 
		usted Inglese?  I'll say it again.  
		Did I urinate on your rug?

				DUDE
		Well no, like I said, Woo peed on 
		the rug--

				LEBOWSKI
		Hello!  Hello!  So every time--I 
		just want to understand this, sir--
		every time a rug is micturated upon 
		in this fair city, I have to 
		compensate the--

				DUDE
		Come on, man, I'm not trying to scam 
		anybody here, I'm just--

				LEBOWSKI
		You're just looking for a handout 
		like every other--are you employed, 
		Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Look, let me explain something.   
		I'm not Mr. Lebowski;  you're Mr. 
		Lebowski.  I'm the Dude.  So that's  
		what  you  call me.  That, or Duder. 
		His  Dudeness.  Or El Duderino, if,  
		you know, you're not into the whole 
		brevity thing--

				LEBOWSKI
		Are you employed, sir?

				DUDE
		Employed?

				LEBOWSKI
		You don't go out and make a living 
		dressed like that in the middle of a 
		weekday.

				DUDE
		Is this a--what day is this?

				LEBOWSKI
		But I do work, so if you don't mind--

				DUDE
		No, look.  I do mind.  The Dude minds.  
		This will not stand, ya know, this 
		will not stand, man.  I mean, if 
		your wife owes--

				LEBOWSKI
		My wife is not the issue here. I 
		hope that my wife will someday learn 
		to live on her allowance, which is 
		ample, but if she doesn't, sir, that 
		will be her problem, not mine, just 
		as your rug is your problem, just as 
		every bum's lot in life is his own 
		responsibility regardless of whom he 
		chooses to blame.  I didn't blame 
		anyone for the loss of my legs, some 
		chinaman in Korea took them from me 
		but I went out and achieved anyway.  
		I can't solve your problems, sir, 
		only you can.

The Dude rises.

				DUDE
		Ah fuck it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Sure!  Fuck it!  That's your answer!  
		Tattoo it on your forehead!  Your 
		answer to everything!

The Dude is heading for the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		Your "revolution" is over, Mr.  
		Lebowski!  Condolences!  The bums 
		lost!

As the Dude opens the door.

				LEBOWSKI
		...My advice is, do what your parents 
		did!  Get a job, sir!  The bums will 
		always lose-- do you hear me, 
		Lebowski?  THE BUMS WILL ALWAYS--

The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find 
himself--

				HALLWAY
		--in a high coffered hallway.  Brandt 
		is approaching.

				BRANDT
		How was your meeting, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Okay.  The old man told me to take 
		any rug in the house.

WALKWAY

A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down 
a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming 
pool to a garage.  Brandt and the Dude follow.

				BRANDT
		Manolo will load it into your car 
		for you, uh, Dude.

				DUDE
		It's the LeBaron.

DUDE'S POINT OF VIEW

Tracking toward the pool.  A young woman sits facing it, her 
back to us, leaning forward to paint her toenails.

Beyond her a black form floats in an inflatable chair in the 
pool.

				BRANDT
		Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see 
		you again some time, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the 
		neighborhood, need to use the john.

CLOSER TRACK

Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the 
nails emerald green.

THE DUDE

Looking.

WIDER

The young woman looks up at him.  She is in her early 
twenties.

She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Blow on them.

The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over 
them.

				DUDE
		Huh?

She waggles her foot and giggles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		G'ahead.  Blow.

The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot.

				DUDE
		You want me to blow on your toes?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh. . . I can't blow that far.

The Dude looks over at the pool.

				DUDE
		You sure he won't mind?

The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out.  He 
is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.  He 
wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, 
shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin.  
One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty 
whiskey bottle bobs.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Dieter doesn't care about anything.  
		He's a nihilist.

				DUDE
		Practicing?

The young woman smiles.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		You're not blowing.

Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow.

				BRANDT
		Our guest has to be getting along, 
		Mrs.  Lebowski.

The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still 
looking at the young woman.

				DUDE
		You're Bunny?

				BUNNY
		I'll suck your cock for a thousand 
		dollars.

Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter:

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha!  Wonderful woman.  Very 
		free-spirited.  We're all very fond 
		of her.

				BUNNY
		Brandt can't watch though.  Or he 
		has to pay a hundred.

				BRANDT
		Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!  That's marvelous.

He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his

SHOULDER:

				DUDE
		I'm just gonna find a cash machine.

BOWLING PINS

Scattered by a strike.

THE BOWLERS

Donny calls out from the bench:

				DONNY
		Grasshopper Dude--They're dead in 
		the water!!

As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to 
another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that 
shares the lane.

				DUDE
		Your maples, Carl.

Walter, just arriving, is carrying a leatherette satchel in 
one hand and a large plastic carrier in the other.

				WALTER
		Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it 
		is no dream.

				DUDE
		You're fucking twenty minutes late.  
		What the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Theodore Herzel.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		State of Israel.  If you will it, 
		Dude, it is no--

				DUDE
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		The carrier.  What's in the fucking 
		carrier?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		Can't leave him home alone or he 
		eats the furniture.

				DUDE
		What the fuck are you--

				WALTER
		I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian.  
		I'm looking after it while Cynthia 
		and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

				DUDE
		You brought a fucking Pomeranian 
		bowling?

				WALTER
		What do you mean "brought it bowling"?  
		I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not 
		buying it a fucking beer.  He's not 
		gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.

He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier.  It scoots 
around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging 
its tail.

				DUDE
		Hey, man, if my fucking ex-wife asked 
		me to take care of her fucking dog 
		while she and her boyfriend went to 
		Honolulu, I'd tell her to go fuck 
		herself.  Why can't she board it?

				WALTER
		First of all, Dude, you don't have 
		an ex, secondly, it's a fucking show 
		dog with fucking papers.  You can't 
		board it.  It gets upset, its hair 
		falls out.

				DUDE
		Hey man--

				WALTER
		Fucking dog has papers, Dude.--Over 
		the line!

Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter.

				WALTER
		Smokey Huh?

				WALTER
		Over the line, Smokey!  I'm sorry.  
		That's a foul.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit.  Eight, Dude.

				WALTER
		Excuse me!  Mark it zero.  Next frame.

				SMOKEY
		Bullshit. Walter!

				WALTER
		This is not Nam.  This is bowling.  
		There are rules.

				DUDE
		Come on Walter, it's just--it's 
		Smokey.  So his toe slipped over a 
		little, it's just a game.

				WALTER
		This is a league game.  This 
		determines who enters the next round-
		robin, am I wrong?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!?

				SMOKEY
		Yeah, but I wasn't over.  Gimme the 
		marker, Dude,  I'm marking it an 
		eight.

Walter takes out a gun.

				WALTER
		Smokey my friend, you're entering a 
		world of pain.

				DUDE
		Hey Walter--

				WALTER
		Mark that frame an eight, you're 
		entering a world of pain.

				SMOKEY
		I'm not--

				WALTER
		A world of pain.

A manager in a bowling-shirt style uniform is running for a 
phone.

				SMOKEY
		Look Dude, I don't hold with this.  
		This guy is your partner, you should--

Walter primes the gun and points it at his head.

				WALTER
		HAS THE WHOLE WORLD GONE CRAZY?  AM 
		I THE ONLY ONE HERE WHO GIVES A SHIT 
		ABOUT THE RULES?  MARK IT ZERO!

The Pomeranian is excitedly yapping at Walter's elbow, making 
high body-twisting tail-wagging leaps.

				DUDE
		Walter, they're calling the cops, 
		put the piece away.

				WALTER
		MARK IT ZERO!

				SMOKEY
		Walter--

				WALTER
		YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE?  
		MARK IT ZERO!!

				SMOKEY
		All right!  There it is!  It's fucking 
		zero!

He points frantically at the score projected above the lane.

				SMOKEY
		You happy, you crazy fuck?

				WALTER
		This is a league game, Smokey!

PARKING LOT

Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car.  The Pomeranian 
trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier.

				DUDE
		Walter, you can't do that.  These 
		guys're like me, they're pacificists.  
		Smokey was a conscientious objector.

				WALTER
		You know Dude, I myself dabbled with 
		pacifism at one point.  Not in Nam, 
		of course--

				DUDE
		And you know Smokey has emotional 
		problems!

				WALTER
		You mean--beyond pacifism?

				DUDE
		He's fragile, man!  He's very fragile!

As the two men get into the car:

				WALTER
		Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, 
		it's water under the bridge.  And we 
		do enter the next round-robin, am I 
		wrong?

				DUDE
		No, you're not wrong--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong!

				DUDE
		You're not wrong, Walter, you're 
		just an asshole.

They watch a squad car take a squealing turn into the lot.

				WALTER
		Okay then.  We play Quintana and 
		O'Brien next week.  They'll be 
		pushovers.

				DUDE
		Just, just take it easy, Walter.

				WALTER
		That's your answer to everything, 
		Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism 
		is not--look at our current situation 
		with that camelfucker in Iraq--
		pacifism is not something to hide 
		behind.

				DUDE
		Well, just take 't easy, man.

				WALTER
		I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah?  Wavin' a gun around?!

				WALTER
			(smugly)
		Calmer than you are.

-his irritates the Dude further.

				DUDE
		Just take it easy, man!

Walter is still smug.

				WALTER
		Calmer than you are.

DUDE'S HOUSE

A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-
up old furniture.

At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing 
kalhua, rum and milk.

				VOICE
		Dude, this is Smokey.  Look, I don't 
		wanna be a hard-on about this, and I 
		know it wasn't your fault, but I 
		just thought it was fair to tell you 
		that Gene and I will be submitting 
		this to the League and asking them 
		to set aside the round.  Or maybe 
		forfeit it to us--

				DUDE
		Shit!

				VOICE
		--so, like I say, just thought, you 
		know, fair warning.  Tell Walter.

A beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Brandt at, uh, 
		well--at Mr. Lebowski's office.  
		Please call us as soon as is 
		convenient.

Beep.

				ANOTHER VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Fred Dynarski 
		with the Southern Cal Bowling League.  
		I just got a, an informal report, 
		uh, that a uh, a member of your team, 
		uh, Walter Sobchak, drew a loaded 
		weapon during league play--

We hear the doorbell.

THE DOOR

It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding 
middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans.

				DUDE
		Hiya Allan.

				ALLAN
		Dude, I finally got the venue I 
		wanted.  I'm Performing my dance 
		quintet--you know, my cycle--at Crane 
		Jackson's Fountain Street Theatre on 
		Tuesday night, and I'd love it if 
		you came and gave me notes.

The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua.

				DUDE
		Sure Allan, I'll be there.

				ALLAN
		Dude, uh, tomorrow is already the 
		tenth.

				DUDE
		Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.

				ALLAN
		Just, uh, just slip the rent under 
		my door.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay.

BACK IN THE LIVING ROOM

The  voice continues on the machine.

				VOICE
		--serious infraction, and examine 
		your standing.  Thank you.  Beep.

				VOICE
		Mr. Lebowski, Brandt again.  Please 
		do call us when you get in and I'll 
		send the limo.  Let me assure you--I 
		hope you're not avoiding this call 
		because of the rug, which, I assure 
		you, is not a problem.  We need your 
		help and, uh--well we would very 
		much like to see you.  Thank you.  
		It's Brandt.

TRACKING

We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway.  
Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano.  Brandt talks back 
over

HIS SHOULDER:

				BRANDT
		We've had some terrible news.  Mr. 
		Lebowski is in seclusion in the West 
		Wing.

				DUDE
		Huh.

Brandt throws open a pair of heavy double doors.  The music 
washes over us as we enter a great study where Jeffrey 
Lebowski, a blanket thrown over his knees, stares hauntedly 
into a fire, listening to Lohengrin.

BRANDT ANNOUNCES, AMBIGUOUSLY:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski.

Jeffrey Lebowski waves the Dude in without looking around.

				LEBOWSKI
		It's funny.  I can look back on a 
		life of achievement, on challenges 
		met, competitors bested, obstacles 
		overcome.  I've accomplished more 
		than most men, and without the use 
		of my legs.  What. . . What makes a 
		man, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Huh?

				DUDE
		I don't know, sir.

				LEBOWSKI
		Is it. . . is it, being prepared to 
		do the right thing?  Whatever the 
		price?  Isn't that what makes a man?

				DUDE
		Sure.  That and a pair of testicles.

Lebowski turns away from the Dude with a haunted stare, lost 
in thought.

				LEBOWSKI
		You're joking.  But perhaps you're 
		right.

The Dude thumps at his chest pocket.

				DUDE
		Mind if I smoke a jay?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny.

He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on 
his cheeks.

				DUDE
		'Scuse me?

				LEBOWSKI
		Bunny Lebowski. . . She is the light 
		of my life.  Are you surprised at my 
		tears, sir?

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A.

				LEBOWSKI
		Strong men also cry. . . Strong men 
		also cry.

He clears his throat.

				LEBOWSKI
		I received this fax this morning.

Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and 
hands it to the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		As you can see, it is a ransom note.  
		Sent by cowards.  Men who are unable 
		to achieve on a level field of play.  
		Men who will not sign their names.  
		Weaklings.  Bums.

THE DUDE EXAMINES THE FAX:

WE HAVE BUNNY.  GATHER ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN UNMARKED NON-
CONSECUTIVE TWENTIES.  AWAIT INSTRUCTIONS.  NO FUNNY STUFF.

				DUDE
		Bummer.

Lebowski looks soulfully at the Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt will fill you in on the 
		details.

He wheels his chair around to once again gaze into the fire.  
Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the 
hall.

HALLWAY

The soprano's singing is once again faint.  Brandt's voice 
is hushed:

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a 
		generous offer to you to act as 
		courier once we get instructions for 
		the money.

				DUDE
		Why me, man?

				BRANDT
		He suspects that the culprits might 
		be the very people who, uh, soiled 
		your rug, and you're in a unique 
		position to confirm or, uh, disconfirm 
		that suspicion.

				DUDE
		So he thinks it's the carpet-pissers, 
		huh?

				BRANDT
		Well Dude, we just don't know.

BOWLING PINS

CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion.

WIDER

Still in slow motion.  We are looking across the length of 
the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying 
perfect form.  He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch 
bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side.

FAST TRACK IN

On the Dude, sitting next to Walter in the molded plastic 
chairs. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler.

				DUDE
		Fucking Quintana--that creep can 
		roll, man--

BACK TO THE BOWLER

Displaying great slow-motion form as the Dude and Walter's 
conversation continues over.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, 
		Dude.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		The man is a sex offender.  With a 
		record.  Spent six months in Chino 
		for exposing himself to an eight-
		year-old.

FLASHBACK

We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater,  
walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging 
the bell.

The VOICE-OVER conversation continues.

				DUDE
		Huh.

				WALTER
		When he moved down to Venice he had 
		to go door-to-door to tell everyone 
		he's a pederast.

The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man 
looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up.

				DONNY
		What's a pederast, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.

PINS

scattered by a strike.

QUINTANA

wheeling and thrusting a black gloved fist into the air.

Stitched above the breast pocket of his all-in-one is his 
first name, "Jesus".

BACK TO WALTER AND THE DUDE

They have been joined by Donny.

				WALTER
		Anyway.  How much they offer you?

				DUDE
		Twenty grand.  And of course I still 
		keep the rug.

				WALTER
		Just for making the hand-off?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket.

				DUDE
		...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so  
		whenever these guys call--

				WALTER
		What if it's during a game?

				DUDE
		I told him if it was during league 
		play--

Donny has been watching Quintana.

				DONNY
		If what's during league play?

				WALTER
		Life does not stop and start at your 
		convenience, you miserable piece of 
		shit.

				DONNY
		What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

				DUDE
		I figure it's easy money, it's all 
		pretty harmless.  I mean she probably 
		kidnapped herself.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DONNY
		What do you mean, Dude?

				DUDE
		Rug-peers did not do this.  I mean 
		look at it.  Young trophy wife.  
		Marries a guy for money but figures 
		he isn't giving her enough.  She 
		owes money all over town--

				WALTER
		That...fucking...bitch!

				DUDE
		It's all a goddamn fake.  Like Lenin 
		said, look for the person who will 
		benefit.  And you will, uh, you know, 
		you'll, uh, you know what I'm trying 
		to say--

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		That fucking bitch!

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				DONNY
		I am the Walrus.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin!  
		Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!

				DONNY
		What the fuck is he talking about?

				WALTER
		That's fucking exactly what happened, 
		Dude!  That makes me fucking SICK!

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?

				DONNY
		Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed 
		off?

				WALTER
		Those rich fucks!  This whole fucking 
		thing-- I did not watch my buddies 
		die face down in the muck so that 
		this fucking strumpet--

				DUDE
		I don't see any connection to Vietnam, 
		Walter.

				WALTER
		Well, there isn't a literal 
		connection, Dude.

				DUDE
		Walter, face it, there isn't any 
		connection.  It's your roll.

				WALTER
		Have it your way.  The point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll--

				WALTER
		The fucking point is--

				DUDE
		It's your roll.

				VOICE
		Are you ready to be fucked, man?

They both look up.

Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of 
the lanes.  Over his polyester all-in-one he now wears a 
windbreaker with a racing stripe and "Jesus" stitched on the 
breast.  He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball 
satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein).  Behind him stands his 
partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.

				QUINTANA
		I see you rolled your way into the 
		semis.  Deos mio, man.  Seamus and 
		me, we're gonna fuck you up.

				DUDE
		Yeah well, that's just, ya know, 
		like, your opinion, man.

Quintana looks at Walter.

				QUINTANA
		Let me tell you something, bendeco.  
		You pull any your crazy shit with 
		us, you flash a piece out on the 
		lanes, I'll take it away from you 
		and stick it up your ass and pull 
		the fucking trigger til it goes 
		"click".

				DUDE
		Jesus.

				QUINTANA
		You said it, man.  Nobody fucks with 
		the Jesus.

Jesus walks away.  Walter nods sadly.

				WALTER
		Eight-year-olds, Dude.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug.  
His eyes are closed.  He wears a Walkman headset.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headphones we can just hear an 
intermittent clatter.

In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE 
BEACH LEAGUE PLAYOFFS 1987.

The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall 
rumbling down the lane.  On its impact with the pins, the 
Dude opens his eyes.

He screams.

A blonde woman looms over him.  Next to  her a  young man  
in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards 
the carrier.

The sap catches the Dude on the chin and sends  his head 
thunking back onto the rug.

A million stars explode against a field of black.  We hear 
the "La-la-la-la" of The Man in Me.

The black field  dissolves into  the pattern  of the  rug.   
The rug rolls away to reveal an aerial view of  the city  of 
Los  Angeles at twilight, moving below us at great speed.

The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in 
front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his 
bowling shirt. He looks up.

Ahead the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the 
Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet.  She is outpacing 
us, growing smaller.

The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices 
that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand.  
His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic 
implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its 
weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He 
is falling. From a high angle we see the Dude hurtling down 
toward the city, dragged by the ball.

A  reverse  looking  up shows  the Dude  hurtling toward  us 
out  of the inky  sky,  his eyes  wide with  horror.  Led by  
the bowling  ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in 
black.

We hear a distant rumble, like thunder.  Dull reflections 
materialize in the darkness.  They are glints off the shiny 
surface of an oncoming bowling ball.

We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of 
a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being 
regurgitated up at us, overtaking us.

The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass 
rolling a huge shadow across his face.

The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward 
us --finger holes.

The largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing 
us once again in black..

The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a 
bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in 
the thumbhole of the rolling ball.

We see the receding bowler spinning away.  It is the blonde 
woman, performing her follow-through.

Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and 
away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; 
ceiling; approaching pins; again and again.

We hit the pins and clatter into blackness.  We hear pins 
spin, hit each other and drop.

We hear an irritating, insistent beeping.

FADE IN

We are close on the Dude, upside down.  As the picture fades 
in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint.  
They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is 
now askew, with one arm off his ear.

As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put 
him right side around.  His head is now resting against 
hardwood floor, not rug.

				DUDE
		Oh man.

He  raises  himself  onto  his  elbows  and  massages  the  
red   lump  on his  jaw.  The  beeper  on his  belt is  
blinking red  in sync  with the continuing irritating beeps.

WIDE ON THE ROOM

An  end  table  is  upset,  but  otherwise the  furniture is  
in place. The rug is gone.

The  Dude  looks  around.    The  bowling sounds  continue.   
The beeps continue.

The phone starts to jangle.

TRACK

We  push  Brandt  down  the  familiar  marble  hallway.   
Again  there is a  distant  aria.    Brandt  throws  out a  
wrist to  look at  his watch.

				BRANDT
		They called about eighty minutes 
		ago.  They want you to take the money 
		and drive north on the 4 5.  They'll 
		call you on the portable phone with 
		instructions in about forty minutes.  
		One person only or I'd go with you.  
		They were very clear on that: one 
		person only.  What happened to your 
		jaw?

				DUDE
		Oh, nothin', you know.

They have reached the little desk outside of the big 
Lebowski's office; Brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key 
and takes out an attache case.  He hands this to the Dude 
along with a cellular phone in a battery-pack carrying case.

				BRANDT
		Here's the money, and the phone.  
		Please, Dude, follow whatever 
		instructions they give.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Oh, man, don't say that..

				BRANDT
		Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that:  
		Her life is in your hands.

				DUDE
		Shit.

				BRANDT
		Her life is in your hands, Dude.  
		And report back to us as soon as 
		it's done.

DUDE'S CAR

We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through 
the front windshield.  The headlights play over Walter 
standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK 
SECURITY.  Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the 
fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look 
oddly like a commuter.  He also holds an irregular shape 
bundled in brown wrapping paper.

The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door 
and hands in the briefcase.

				WALTER
		Take the ringer.  I'll drive.

The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over.

				DUDE
		The what?

				WALTER
		The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have 
		they called yet?

The Dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it 
as the car starts rolling.

				DUDE
		What the hell is this?

				WALTER
		My dirty undies.  Laundry, Dude.  
		The whites.

				DUDE
		Agh--

He closes the briefcase.

				DUDE
		Walter, I'm sure there's a reason 
		you brought your dirty undies--

				WALTER
		Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight.  
		The ringer can't look empty.

				DUDE
		Walter--what the fuck are you 
		thinking?

				WALTER
		Well you're right, Dude, I got to 
		thinking.  I got to thinking why 
		should we settle for a measly fucking 
		twenty grand--

				DUDE
		We?  What the fuck we?  You said you 
		just wanted to come along--

				WALTER
		My point, Dude, is why should we 
		settle for twenty grand when we can 
		keep the entire million.  Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a 
		fucking game, Walter--

				WALTER
		It is a fucking game.  You said so 
		yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--

				DUDE '
		Yeah, but--

The phone chirps.  Dude grabs it.

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
			(German accent)
		Who is this?

				DUDE
		Dude the Bagman.  Where do you want 
		us to go?

				VOICE
		...Us?
		DUDE

Shit. . . Uh, yeah, you know, me and the driver.  I'm not 
handling the money and driving the car and talking on the 
phone all by my fucking--

				VOICE
		Shut the fuck up.
			(Beat)
		Hello?

				DUDE
		Yeah?

				VOICE
		Okay, listen--

Walter looks over at the Dude and bellows:

				WALTER
		Dude, are you fucking this up?

				VOICE
		Who is that?

				DUDE
		The driver man, I told you--

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		Oh shit.  Walter.

				WALTER
		What the fuck is going on there?

				DUDE
		They hung up, Walter!  You fucked it 
		up!  You fucked it up!  Her life was 
		in our hands!

				WALTER
		Easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		We're screwed now!  We don't get 
		shit and they're gonna kill her!  
		We're fucked, Walter!

				WALTER
		Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on.  
		You're being very unDude.  They'll 
		call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--

The phone chirps.

				WALTER
		Ya see?  Nothing is fucked up here, 
		Dude.  Nothing is fucked.  These  
		guys are fucking amateurs--

				DUDE
		Shutup, Walter!  Don't fucking say 
		peep when I'm doing business here.

				WALTER
			(patronizing)
		Okay Dude.  Have it your way.

The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack.

				WALTER
		But they're amateurs.

The Dude glares at Walter.  Into the phone:

				DUDE
		Dude here.

				VOICE
		Okay, vee proceed.  But only if there 
		is no funny stuff.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				VOICE
		So no funny stuff.  Okay?

				DUDE
		Hey, just tell me where the fuck you 
		want us to go.

A HIGHWAY SIGN:  SIMI VALLEY ROAD

It flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.

				DUDE
		That was the sign.

Walter wrestles the car onto the two-lane road.

				WALTER
		Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, 
		nobody's in a position to complain.  
		And we keep the baksheesh.

				DUDE
		Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't 
		told me how we get her back.  Where 
		is she?

				WALTER
		That's the simple part, Dude.  When  
		we make the handoff, I grab the guy 
		and beat  it out of him.

He looks at the Dude.

				WALTER
		...Huh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter.  
		That's fucking ingenious, if I 
		understand it correctly.  That's a 
		Swiss fucking watch.

				WALTER
		Thaaat's right, Dude.  The beauty of 
		this is its simplicity. If the plan 
		gets too complex something always 
		goes wrong.  If there's one thing I 
		learned in Nam--

The phone chirps.

				DUDE
		Dude.

				VOICE
		You are approaching a vooden britch.  
		When you cross it you srow ze bag 
		from ze left vindow of ze moving 
		kar.  Do not slow down.  Vee vatch 
		you.

Click.  Dial tone.

				DUDE
		FUCK.

				WALTER
		What'd he say?  Where's the hand-
		off?

				DUDE
		There is no fucking hand-off, Walter!   
		At a wooden bridge we throw the money 
		out  of the car!

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		We throw the money out of the moving 
		car!

Walter stares dumbly for a beat.

				WALTER
		We can't do that, Dude.  That fucks 
		up our plan.

				DUDE
		Well call them up and explain it to 
		'em, Walter!  Your plan is so fucking 
		simple, I'm sure they'd fucking 
		understand it!  That's the beauty of 
		it Walter!

				WALTER
		Wooden bridge, huh?

				DUDE
		I'm throwing the money, Walter!  
		We're not fucking around!

				WALTER
		The bridge is coming up!  Gimme the 
		ringer, Dude!  Chop-chop!

				DUDE
		Fuck that!  I love you, Walter, but 
		sooner or later you're gonna have to 
		face the fact that you're a goddamn 
		moron.

				WALTER
		Okay, Dude.  No time to argue.  Here's 
		the bridge--

There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge.  
The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from 
the back seat.  Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to 
grab the laundry.

And there goes the ringer.

He flings it out the window.

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!

				DUDE
		What the fuck?

				WALTER
		Your wheel!  At fifteen em-pee-aitch 
		I roll out!  I double back, grab one 
		of 'em and beat it out of him!  The 
		uzi!

				DUDE
		Uzi?

Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle.

				WALTER
		You didn't think I was rolling out 
		of here naked!

				DUDE
		Walter, please--

Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out 
over the road.

				WALTER
		Fifteen!  This is it, Dude!  Let's 
		take that hill!

Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he 
hits the pavement.  The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, 
cursing, takes the wheel.

OUTSIDE

Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle 
flashes tear open the wrapping paper.

INSIDE THE CAR

The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel.

OUTSIDE

The car clunks and screams around in a skid.

INSIDE

The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something.

OUTSIDE

As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The 
front of his car is crumpled into a tree.  The car body saps 
back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out.

WALTER  is  just  rising  from  the  ground  massaging an  
injured knee.

The  Dude  runs  up  the  road  toward  the bridge,  
frantically waving the satchel in the air.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!  WE HAVE IT!!

There is a distant engine roar.  A motorcycle bumps up onto 
the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires 
squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite 
direction.  It is closely followed by two more roaring 
motorcycles.

				DUDE
		WE HAVE IT!!. . . We have it!

The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching 
the three red tail lights fishtail away.

AFTER A LONG STARING SILENCE:

				WALTER
		Ahh fuck it, let's go bowling.

BOWLING LANE

A ball rumbles in to scatter ten pins.

WALTER.

He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of 
molded plastic chairs.  The Dude listlessly holds the portable 
phone in his lap.  It is ringing.

				WALTER
		Aitz chaim he, Dude.  As the ex used 
		to say.

				DUDE
		What the fuck is that supposed to 
		mean?  What the fuck're we gonna 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Huh?  Oh, him, yeah.  Well I don't 
		see, um-- what exactly is the problem?

The portable phone stops ringing.

				DUDE
		Huh?  The problem is--what do you 
		mean what's the--there's no--we didn't--
		they're gonna kill that poor woman--

				WALTER
		What the fuck're you talking about?  
		That poor woman--that poor slut--
		kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said 
		so yourself--

				DUDE
		No, Walter!  I said I thought she 
		kidnapped herself!  You're the one 
		who's so fucking certain--

				WALTER
		That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--

Donny is trotting excitedly up.

				DONNY
		They posted the next round of the 
		tournament--

				WALTER
		Donny, shut the f--when do we play?

				DONNY
		This Saturday.  Quintana and--

				WALTER
		Saturday!  Well they'll have to 
		reschedule.

				DUDE
		Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		I told that fuck down at the league 
		office-- who's in charge of 
		scheduling?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				DONNY
		Burkhalter.

				WALTER
		I told that kraut a fucking thousand 
		times I don't roll on shabbas.

				DONNY
		It's already posted.

				WALTER
		WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit, Walter?  What about 
		that poor woman?  What do we tell--

				WALTER
		C'mon Dude, eventually she'll get 
		sick of her little game and, you 
		know, wander back--

				DONNY
		How come you don't roll on Saturday, 
		Walter?

				WALTER
		I'm shomer shabbas.

				DONNY
		What's that, Walter?

				DUDE
		Yeah, and in the meantime what do I 
		tell Lebowski?

				WALTER
		Saturday is shabbas.  Jewish day of 
		rest.  Means I don't work, I don't 
		drive a car, I don't fucking ride in 
		a car, I don't handle money, I don't 
		turn on the oven, and I sure as shit 
		don't fucking roll!

				DONNY
		Sheesh.

				DUDE
		Walter, how--

				WALTER
		Shomer shabbas.

The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone.

				DUDE
		That's it.  I'm out of here.

				WALTER
		For Christ's sake, Dude.

Walter and Donny join the Dude as he walks out of the bowling 
alley.

Hell, you just tell him--well, you tell him, uh, we made the 
hand-off, everything went, uh, you know--

				DONNY
		Oh yeah, how'd it go?

				WALTER
		Went alright.  Dude's car got a little 
		dinged up--

				DUDE
		But Walter, we didn't make the fucking 
		hand- off!  They didn't get, the 
		fucking money and they're gonna--
		they're gonna--

				WALTER
		Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."

He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra.

				WALTER
		Kill that poor woman.

				DONNY
		Walter, if you can't ride in a car, 
		how d'you get around on Shammas--

				WALTER
		Really, Dude, you surprise me.  
		They're not gonna kill shit.  They're 
		not gonna do shit.  What can they 
		do?  Fuckin' amateurs.  And meanwhile, 
		look at the bottom line.  Who's 
		sitting on a million fucking dollars?  
		Am I wrong?

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		Who's got a fucking million fucking 
		dollars parked in the trunk of our 
		car out here?

				DUDE
		"Our" car, Walter?

				WALTER
		And what do they got, Dude?  My dirty 
		undies.  My fucking whites--Say, 
		where is  the car?

The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out 
at an empty parking space.

				DONNY
		Who has your undies, Walter?

				WALTER
		Where's your car, Dude?

				DUDE
		You don't know, Walter?  You seem to 
		know the answer to everything else!

				WALTER
		Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped 
		spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.

				DUDE
		It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking 
		know it's been stolen!

				WALTER
		Well, certainly that's a possibility, 
		Dude--

				DUDE
		Aw, fuck it.

The Dude walks away across the lot.  The portable phone starts 
ringing again.

				DONNY
		Where you going, Dude?

				DUDE
		I'm going home, Donny.

				DONNY
		Your phone's ringing, Dude.

				DUDE
		Thank you, Donny.

DUDE'S LIVING ROOM

The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, 
fingers of one hand cupped over his sunglasses.  Facing him 
on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, 
the other a fresh-faced rookie.

At the cut the portable phone, in the Dude's lap, is chirping.  
The Dude waits for the rings to end.  When they do:

				DUDE
		1972 Pontiac LeBaron.

				YOUNGER COP
		Color?

				DUDE
		Green.  Some brown, or, uh, rust, 
		coloration.

				YOUNGER COP
		And was there anything of value in  
		the car?

DULLY:

				DUDE
		Huh?  Oh.  Yeah.  Tape deck.  Couple 
		of Creedence tapes.  And there was 
		a, uh. . . my briefcase.

				YOUNGER COP
		In the briefcase?

				DUDE
		Papers.  Just papers.  You know, my 
		papers.  Business papers.

				YOUNGER COP
		And what do you do, sir?

				DUDE
		I'm unemployed.

				OLDER COP
		...Most people, we're working nights, 
		they offer us coffee.

There is silence.  Dude continues to stare at a spot on the 
floor.  The older cop stares at him.

				DUDE
		...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But 
		it's nice when they offer.

AT LENGTH:

				DUDE
		...Also, my rug was stolen.

				YOUNGER COP
		Your rug was in the car.

The Dude taps the floor with his foot.

				DUDE
		No.  Here.

				YOUNGER COP
		Separate incidents?

The Dude stares at the floor.

Silence.

				OLDER COP
		Snap out of it, son.

The home phone starts ringing--a ring distinct  from the  
chirp of the portable.  The Dude makes no move to answer  
it.   Finally the rings stop as an answering machine kicks 
on.

				DUDE
		You find them much?  Stolen cars?

Dude's Voice on Machine The Dude's not in.  Leave a message 
after the beep.  It takes a minute.

				YOUNGER COP
		Sometimes.  I wouldn't hold out much 
		hope for the tape deck though.  Or 
		the Creedence tapes.

				DUDE
		And the, uh, the briefcase?

Beep.

				FEMALE VOICE ON MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.  
		Call when you get home and I'll send 
		a car for you.  My name is Maude 
		Lebowski.  I'm the woman who took 
		the rug.

Beep.  Dial tone.

				OLDER COP
		Well, I guess we can close the file 
		on that one.

TRACKING FORWARD

We are moving through the open living area of a large downtown 
L.A. loft.  A huge unfinished canvas,  lit by  standing 
industrial lights, dominates one wall.  The furnishings  are 
spare  given the space.  On the floor is the Dude's brilliant 
rug.

We hear a rumble like an approaching bowling ball.  The Dude, 
standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky 
depths of the cavernous space.

Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head.  
As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass.

We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended 
from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the 
floor.  She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush 
in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas.

The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps.  Two 
young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers 
reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track 
and haul it back for another push.

				VOICE
		I'll be with you in a minute, Mr. 
		Lebowski.

She rumbles by in another pass.

All right, we'll do the blue tomorrow.  Elfranco.  Pedro.  
Help me down.

The  two  men  help Maude  out of  her sling.   She  is naked  
except for leather  harness  straps  which  ring  her  breasts  
and wrap  her thighs and give her something of a dominatrix 
look.

Does the female form make you uncomfor- table, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Is that what that's a picture of?

				MAUDE
		In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. 
		My art has been commended as being 
		strongly vaginal.  Which bothers 
		some men.  The word itself makes 
		some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.

				DUDE
		Oh yeah?

				MAUDE
		Yes, they don't like hearing it and 
		find it difficult to say.  Whereas 
		without batting an eye a man will 
		refer to his "dick" or his "rod" or 
		his "Johnson".

				DUDE
		"Johnson"?

				MAUDE
		Thank you.

This to Elfranco, who has handed her a robe.

All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.  My father 
told me he's agreed to let you have the rug, but it was a 
gift from me to my late mother, and so was not his to give.  
Now.  As for this. . . "kidnapping"--

				DUDE
		Huh?

				MAUDE
		Yes, I know about it.  And I know 
		that you acted as courier.  And let 
		me tell you something:  the whole 
		thing stinks to high heaven.

				DUDE
		Right, but let me explain something 
		about that rug--

				MAUDE
		Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				MAUDE
		Sex.  The physical act of love.  
		Coitus.  Do you like it?

				DUDE
		I was talking about my rug.

				MAUDE
		You're not interested in sex?

				DUDE
		You mean coitus?

				MAUDE
		I like it too.  It's a male myth 
		about feminists that we hate sex.  
		It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. 
		But unfortunately there are some 
		people--it is called satyriasis in 
		men, nymphomania in women--who engage 
		in it compulsively and without joy.

				DUDE
		Oh, no.

				MAUDE
		Yes Mr. Lebowski, these unfortunate 
		souls cannot love in the true sense 
		of the word.  Our mutual acquaintance 
		Bunny is one of these.

				DUDE
		Listen, Maude, I'm sorry if your 
		stepmother is a nympho, but I don't 
		see what it has to do with--do you 
		have any kalhua?

				MAUDE
		Take a look at this, sir.

She is aiming a remote at a projection TV.  The screen 
flickers to life.  A title card:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

SECOND CARD:

KARL HUNGUS

AND

BUNNY LAJOYA

IN

A THIRD CARD:

LOGJAMMIN'

The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway  
to his glass.

From the television set we hear a doorbell ring, and then  a 
door opening.

On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced  
man in blue coyer-alls.  It is Dieter, the floater in  
Lebowski's pool.

				DIETER
		Hello.  Nein dizbatcher says zere 
		iss problem mit deine kable.

				DUDE
		Shit, I know that guy.  He's a 
		nihilist.

				MAUDE
		And you recognize her, of course.

The girl answering the door is Bunny Lebowski.

Bunny The TV is in here.

				DIETER
		Za, okay, I bring mein toolz.

Bunny This is my friend Shari.  She just came over to use 
the shower.

				MAUDE
			(grimly)
		The story is ludicrous.

				DIETER
		Mein nommen iss Karl.  Is hard to 
		verk in zese clozes--

Maude switches off the set.

				MAUDE
		Lord.  You can imagine where it goes 
		from here.

				DUDE
		He fixes the cable?

				MAUDE
		Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.  Little 
		matter to me that this woman chose 
		to pursue a career

in pornography, nor that she has been "banging" Jackie 
Treehorn, to use the parlance of our times.  However.  I am 
one of two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation, the other 
being my father.  The Foundation takes youngsters from Watts 
and--

				DUDE
		Shit yeah, the achievers.

				MAUDE
		Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, 
		yes, and proud we are of all of them.  
		I asked my father about his withdrawal 
		of a million dollars from the 
		Foundation account and he told me 
		about this "abduction", but I tell 
		you it is preposterous.  This 
		compulsive

fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but my-

				MAUDE
		I'm getting to your rug. My  father 
		and I don't get along; he doesn't 
		approve of my lifestyle and, needless 
		to say, I don't approve of his.  
		Still, I hardly wish to make my 
		father's embezzlement a police matter, 
		so I'm proposing that you try to 
		recover the money from the people 
		you delivered it to.

				DUDE
		Well--sure, I could do that--

				MAUDE
		If you successfully do so, I will 
		compensate you to the tune of 1% of 
		the recovered sum.

				DUDE
		A hundred.

				MAUDE
		Thousand, yes, bones or clams or 
		whatever you call them.

				DUDE
		Yeah, but what about--

				MAUDE
		--your rug, yes, well with that money 
		you can buy any number of rugs that 
		don't have sentimental value for me.  
		And I am sorry about that crack on 
		the jaw.

The Dude fingers his jaw, where the lump from the sap has 
all but disappeared.

				DUDE
		Oh that's okay, I hardly even--

				MAUDE
		Here's the name and number of a doctor 
		who will look at it for you.  You 
		will receive no bill.  He's a good 
		man, and thorough.

				DUDE
		That's really thoughtful but I--

				MAUDE
		Please see him, Jeffrey.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

LIMO

The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian,  listening to 
the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery 
cap a ponytail emerges.

				DRIVER
		--So he says, "My son can't hold a 
		job, my daughter's married to a 
		fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on 
		my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown.  
		But you know me.  I can't complain."

THROUGH RASPING LAUGHTER:

				DUDE
		Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash.			 
		Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya 
		Tony.

He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves 
milk on his mustache.

I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost  a 
little  money, I  was down in the dumps.

				TONY
		Aw, forget about it.

				DUDE
		Yeah, man!  Fuck it!  I can't be 
		worrying about that shit.  Life goes 
		on!

The limo has rolled to a stop.  The Dude gets out, still 
holding his drink.

				TONY
		Home sweet home, Mr. L.  Who's your 
		friend in the Volkswagon?

				DUDE
		Huh?

His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his 
shoulder.

He followed us here.

The Dude turns to look.

HIS POV

Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the 
curb.  In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape.

THE DUDE

He scowls.

				DUDE
		When did he-

The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-
nelson by another uniformed chauffeur.

				SECOND CHAUFFEUR
		Into the limo, you sonofabitch.  No 
		arguments.

As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds 
his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it.

				DUDE
		Fuck, man!  There's a beverage here!

The waiting limo's back door is flung open.

INSIDE

The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the 
rear. The door is slammed behind him.

				LEBOWSKI
		Start talking and talk fast you lousy 
		bum!

				BRANDT
		We've been frantically trying to 
		reach you, Dude.

Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from 
the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.

				LEBOWSKI
		Where's my goddamn money, you bum?!

				DUDE
		Well we--I don't--

				LEBOWSKI
		They did not receive the money, you 
		nitwit!  They  did not receive the 
		goddamn money.  HER LIFE WAS IN YOUR 
		HANDS!

				BRANDT
		This is our concern, Dude.

				DUDE
		No, man, nothing is fucked here--

				LEBOWSKI
		NOTHING IS FUCKED! THE GODDAMN PLANE 
		HAS CRASHED INTO THE MOUNTAIN!

The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink.

				DUDE
		C'mon man, who're you gonna believe?  
		Those guys are--we dropped off the 
		damn money--

				LEBOWSKI
		WHAT?!

				DUDE
		I--the royal we, you know, the 
		editorial--I dropped off the money, 
		exactly as per--Look, I've got certain 
		information, certain things have 
		come to light, and uh, has it ever 
		occurred to you, man, that given the 
		nature of all this new shit, that, 
		uh, instead of running around blaming 
		me, that this whole thing might just 
		be, not, you know, not just such a 
		simple, but uh--you know?

				LEBOWSKI
		What in God's holy name are you 
		blathering about?

				DUDE
		I'll tell you what I'm blathering 
		about!  I got information--new shit 
		has come to light and--shit, man!  
		She kidnapped herself!

Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck.  The Dude is encouraged.

				DUDE
		Well sure, look at it!  Young trophy 
		wife, I mean, in the parlance of our 
		times, owes money all over town, 
		including to known pornographers--
		and that's cool, that's cool-- but 
		I'm saying, she needs money, and of 
		course they're gonna say they didn't 
		get it 'cause she wants more, man, 
		she's gotta feed the monkey, I mean--
		hasn't that ever occurred to you...?  
		Sir?

				LEBOWSKI
			(quietly)
		No.  No Mr. Lebowski, that had not 
		occurred to me.

				BRANDT
		That had not occurred to us, Dude.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, you're not privy to all 
		the new shit, so uh, you know, but 
		that's what you pay me for.  Speaking 
		of which, would it be possible for 
		me to get my twenty grand in cash?  
		I gotta check this with my accountant 
		of course, but my concern is that, 
		you know, it could bump me into a 
		higher tax--

				LEBOWSKI
		Brandt, give him the envelope.

				DUDE
		Well, okay, if you've already made 
		out the check.  Brandt is handing 
		him a letter-sized envelope which is 
		distended by something inside.

				BRANDT
		We received it this morning.

The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton 
wadding and unrolls it.

				LEBOWSKI
		Since you have failed to achieve, 
		even in the modest task that was 
		your charge, since you have stolen 
		my money, and since you have 
		unrepentantly betrayed my trust.

The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up 
inside.  The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and 
starts to unroll the inner package.

				LEBOWSKI
		I have no choice but to tell these 
		bums that they should do whatever is 
		necessary to recover their money 
		from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.  And 
		with Brandt as my witness, tell you 
		this:  Any further harm visited upon 
		Bunny, shall be visited tenfold upon 
		your head.

Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents 
of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish.

				LEBOWSKI
		...By God sir.  I will not abide 
		another toe.

COFFEE SHOP

The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off 
into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little 
clinking noises.

AFTER A LONG BEAT:

				WALTER
		That wasn't her toe.

				DUDE
		Whose toe was it, Walter?

				WALTER
		How the fuck should I know?  I do 
		know that nothing about it indicates--

				DUDE
		The nail polish, Walter.

				WALTER
		Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible 
		to get some nail polish, apply it to 
		someone else's toe--

				DUDE
		Someone else's--where the fuck are 
		they gonna--

				WALTER
		You want a toe?  I can get you a 
		toe, believe me.  There are ways, 
		Dude.  You don't wanna know about 
		it, believe me.

				DUDE
		But Walter--

				WALTER
		I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this 
		afternoon--with nail  polish. These  
		fucking amateurs.   They send us a  
		toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- 
		selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My  
		point is--

				DUDE
		They're gonna kill her, Walter, and 
		then they're gonna kill me--

				WALTER
		Well that's just, that's the stress 
		talking, Dude.  So far we have what 
		looks to me like a series of 
		victimless crimes--

				DUDE
		What about the toe?

				WALTER
		FORGET ABOUT THE FUCKING TOE!

A waitress enters.

				WAITRESS
		Could you please keep your voices 
		down--this is a family restaurant.

				WALTER
		Oh, please dear!  I've got news for 
		you: the Supreme Court has roundly 
		rejected prior restraint!

				DUDE
		Walter, this isn't a First Amendment 
		thing.

				WAITRESS
		Sir, if you don't calm down I'm going 
		to have to ask you to leave.

				WALTER
		Lady, I got buddies who died face-
		down in the muck so you and I could 
		enjoy this family restaurant!

THE DUDE GETS UP:

				DUDE
		All right, I'm leaving.  I'm sorry 
		ma'am.

				WALTER
		Don't run away from this, Dude!  
		Goddamnit, this affects all of us!

The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him:

				WALTER
		Our basic freedoms!

He looks defiantly around.

				WALTER
		I'm staying.  Finishing my coffee.

He stirs the coffee, bopping his head in time to the Muzak, 
affecting nonchalance.

				WALTER
		Finishing my coffee.

DUDE'S BATHROOM

A dripping noise.

The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint 
pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head.

We hear the phone ringing in the other roam.

The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the 
soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub.

After the Dude's outgoing message we hear:

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty Officer 
		Rolvaag of the L.A.P.D.

The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying.

				VOICE THROUGH MACHINE
		We've recovered your vehicle.  It 
		can be claimed at the North Hollywood 
		Auto Circus there on Victory.

				DUDE
		Far out.  Far fuckin' out.

				MESSAGE
		You'll just need to present a--

The message is interrupted by loud smashing sounds, as of 
someone applying a baseball bat to the answering machine.

				DUDE
		Hunh?

He looks blearily at the open doorway.

A tall man dressed in black leather with a cricket paddle is 
striding across the living room towards the bathroom.

				DUDE
		Hey!  This is a private residence, 
		man!

The man has entered the bathroom and, in stride, swings the 
cricket paddle up to smash the overhead light.  Two other 
men are entering behind him.

The room is dark now except for spill from the living room; 
the men are backlit shapes.

One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small 
animal skitters excitedly about the floor.

The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal.

				DUDE
		Nice marmot.

The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, 
screaming, into the bathtub.

The Dude screams.

The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a 
frenzy of fearful aggression.

				FIRST MAN
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

The Dude, screaming, grabs the lip of the tub and starts to 
hoist himself up but the first man lays a palm on top of his 
head and squishes him back into the water.

				SECOND MAN
		You think veer kidding und making 
		mit de funny stuff?

				THIRD MAN
		Vee could do things you only dreamed 
		of, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, vee could really do it, Lebowski.  
		Vee belief in nossing.

He scoops the marmot out of the water.  It shakes itself 
off, spraying the Dude.

				DUDE
		Jesus!

				DIETER
		Vee belief in nossing, Lebowski!  
		NOSSING!!

The marmot, back on the floor, is skittering around, shaking 
itself and convulsing in little sneezes.

				DUDE
		Jesus Christ!

				FIRST MAN
		Tomorrow vee come back und cut off 
		your chonson.

				DUDE
		Excuse me?

				FIRST MAN
		I SAY VEE CUT OFF YOUR CHONSON!

The three men turn to leave.  Over their retreating backs:

				SECOND MAN
		Just sink about zat, Lebowski.

				FIRST MAN
		Ja, your viggly penis, Lebowski.

				SECOND MAN
		Ja, und maybe vee stamp on it und 
		skvush it, Lebowski!

NORTH HOLLYWOOD AUTO CIRCUS

A policeman with a clipboard is leading the Dude through a 
large parking lot.

				POLICEMAN
		You're lucky she wasn't chopped, Mr.  
		Lebowski. Must've been a joyride 
		situation; they abandoned the car 
		once they hit the retaining wall.

They have reached the Dude's car.  The  driver's side  
exterior has been scraped raw.  The policeman hands the Dude  
a door  handle and an exterior rear-view mirror.

				POLICEMAN
		These were on the road next to the 
		car.  You'll have to get in on the 
		other side.

The Dude climbs in the passenger side.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  It's not here!

				POLICEMAN
		Yeah, sorry, I saw that on the report.  
		You're lucky they left the tape deck 
		though.

				DUDE
		My fucking briefcase!  Jesus--what's 
		that smell?

				POLICEMAN
		Uh, yeah.  Probably a vagrant, slept 
		in the car.  Or perhaps just used it 
		as a toilet, and moved on.

The Dude tries to roll down the driver's window but it will 
not go; he bellows through the glass:

				DUDE
		When will you find these guys?  I 
		mean, do you have any promising leads?

The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly.

				POLICEMAN
		Leads, yeah.  I'll just check with 
		the boys down at the Crime Lab.  
		They've assigned four more detectives 
		to the case, got us working in shifts.

The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman 
rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by 
the glass.

BOWLING ALLEY BAR

The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a 
White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer 
nuts.

				DONNY
		And then they're gonna stamp on it?!

				WALTER
		Oh for Christ--will you shut the 
		fuck up, Donny.

				DUDE
		I figure my only hope is that the 
		big Lebowski kills me before the 
		Germans can cut my dick off.

				WALTER
		Now that is ridiculous, Dude.  No 
		one is going to cut your dick off.

				DUDE
		Thanks Walter.

				WALTER
		Not if I have anything to say about 
		it.

				DUDE
			(bitterly)
		Yeah, thanks Walter.  That gives me 
		a very secure feeling.

				WALTER
		Dude--

				DUDE
		That makes me feel all warm inside.

				WALTER
		Now Dude--

				DUDE
		This whole fucking thing--I  could 
		be sitting here with just pee-stains 
		on my rug.

Walter sadly shakes his head.

				WALTER
		Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes.  
		Fucking Nazis.

				DONNY
		They were Nazis, Dude?

				WALTER
		Come on, Donny, they were threatening 
		castration!

				DONNY
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Are you gonna split hairs?

				DONNY
		No--

				WALTER
		Am I wrong?

				DONNY
		Well--

				DUDE
		They're nihilists.

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		They kept saying they believe in 
		nothing.

				WALTER
		Nihilists!  Jesus.

Walter looks haunted.

Say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, 
Dude, at least it's an ethos.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		And let's also not forget--let's not 
		forget, Dude--that keeping wildlife, 
		an amphibious rodent, for uh, 
		domestic, you know, within the city--
		that isn't legal either.

				DUDE
		What're you, a fucking park ranger 
		now?

				WALTER
		No, I'm--

				DUDE
		Who gives a shit about the fucking 
		marmot!

				WALTER
		--We're sympathizing here, Dude--

				DUDE
		Fuck your sympathy!  I don't need 
		your sympathy, man, I need my fucking 
		Johnson!

				DONNY
		What do you need that for, Dude?

				WALTER
		You gotta buck up, man, you can't go 
		into the tournament with this negative 
		attitude--

				DUDE
		Fuck the tournament!  Fuck you, 
		Walter!

There is a moment of stunned silence.

				WALTER
		Fuck the tournament?!

SAD; QUIET:

				WALTER
		Okay Dude.  I can see you don't want 
		to be cheered up.  C'mon Donny, let's 
		go get a lane.

They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar.  As he stares

DOWN INTO HIS EMPTY GLASS:

				DUDE
		Another Caucasian, Gary.

				VOICE
		Right, Dude.

STILL STARING DOWN AT THE BAR:

				DUDE
		Friends like these, huh Gary.

				GARY
		That's right, Dude.

The pop song on the jukebox has ended; someone puts on 
"Tumbling Tumbleweeds."

A man saunters up to the bar to take the stool that Walter 
vacated.  He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam 
Elliot, perhaps.  He has a large Western-style mustache and 
wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat.

TO THE BARTENDER:

				MAN
		D'ya have a good sarsaparilla?

We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened 
the movie.

				BARTENDER
		Sioux City Sarsaparilla.

The Stranger nods.

				THE STRANGER
		That's a good one.

Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar.  His 
crinkled eyes settle on the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		How ya doin' there, Dude?

The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head.

				DUDE
		Ahh, not so good, man.

				THE STRANGER
		One a those days, huh.  Wal, a wiser 
		fella than m'self once said, sometimes 
		you eat the bar and sometimes the 
		bar, wal, he eats you.

				DUDE
			(absently)
		Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern 
		thing?

				THE STRANGER
		Far from it.

				DUDE
		Mm.

The bartender puts a brown bottle and a frosted glass on the 
bar in front of The Stranger, who touches his hat brim.

				THE STRANGER
		Much obliged.

He looks back at the Dude.

				THE STRANGER
		I like your style, Dude.

THE DUDE LOOKS UP, ABSENTLY:

				DUDE
		Well I like your style too, man.  
		Got a whole cowboy thing goin'.

				THE STRANGER
		Thankie. . . Just one thing, Dude.  
		D'ya have to use s'many cuss words?

The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how 
out of place the cowpoke is.

				DUDE
		The fuck are you talking about?

The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the 
bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Okay, have it your way.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip.

				THE STRANGER
		Take it easy, Dude.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Thanks man.

He is gone.  "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" is ending as we hear an 
offscreen voice, breaking the spell:

				VOICE
		Dude!  Dude!

THE DUDE LOOKS:

Tony, the unformed limo driver, is at the door of the bar, 
beckoning.

MAUDE'S LOFT

She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just 
cinching shut.  Paint flecks her skin.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the 
		doctor.

				DUDE
		No it's fine, really, uh--

				MAUDE
		Do you have any news regarding my 
		father's money?

				DUDE
		I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta 
		respecfully, 69 you know, tender my 
		resignation on that matter, 'cause 
		it looks like your mother really was 
		kidnapped after all.

				MAUDE
		She most certainly was not!

				DUDE
		Hey man, why don't you fucking listen 
		occasionally?  You might learn 
		something.  Now I got--

				MAUDE
		And please don't call her my mother.

				DUDE
		Now I got--

				MAUDE
		She is most definitely the perpetrator 
		and not the victim.

				DUDE
		I'm telling you, I got definitive 
		evidence--

				MAUDE
		From who?

				DUDE
		The main guy, Dieter--

				MAUDE
		Dieter Hauff?

				DUDE
		Well--yeah, I guess--

				MAUDE
		Her "co-star" in the beaver picture?

				DUDE
		Beaver?  You mean vagina?--I mean, 
		you know him?

				MAUDE
		Dieter has been on the fringes of--
		well, of everything in L.A., for 
		about twenty years.  Look at my LP's.  
		Under 'Autobahn.'

The Dude fingers through the albums filling one bookshelf.

				MAUDE
		That was his group--they released 
		one album in the mid-seventies.

The Dude stops between two albums.

				DUDE
		Roy Orbison. . . Pink Floyd.

				MAUDE
		Huh?  Autobahn.  A-u-t-o.  Their 
		music is a sort of--ugh--techno-pop.

The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve.  On it is 
the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a 
picture

OF THREE YOUNG GERMANS, THEIR FOREHEADS LOOMING BELOW 
SLICKED-

back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany.  They are 
wearing severe but modishly retro suits.  Each has his name 
under his picture--Dieter, Kieffer; and Franz.  A bed of 
nails is the only set dressing on the cyc.

				DUDE
		Jeez.  I miss vinyl.

				MAUDE
		Is he pretending to be the abductor?

				DUDE
		Well...yeah--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, you don't really  
		kidnap someone that you're acquainted 
		with.  You can't get away with it if 
		the hostage knows who you are.

				DUDE
		Well yeah...I know that.

				MAUDE
		So Dieter has the money?

				DUDE
		Well, no, not exactly.  It's a 
		complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins.  
		Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to 
		keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands 
		in old Duder's--

				MAUDE
		Do you still have that doctor's 
		number?

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, really, I don't even have 
		the bruise any more, I--

She is scribbling.

				MAUDE
		Please Jeffrey.  I don't want to be 
		responsible for any delayed after-
		effects.

				DUDE
		Delayed after-eff--

				MAUDE
		I want you to see him immediately.

She is picking up a telephone.

				MAUDE
		I'll see if he's available.  He's a 
		good man, and thorough.

CLOSE SHOT   THE DUDE

His eyes are closed, a headset on, his shirt off.  Leaking 
tinnily through the headset we hear the opening bars of 
"Comin' Up Around the Bend."

Behind him, cropped so that we see only a little of his torso, 
a white-smocked figure taps at the Dude's back.  After a 
moment the figure circles to one side, out of frame.  His 
hand reaches in to pull one arm of the headset away from the 
Dude's ear, and as he does so the music issues more strongly.

				VOICE
		Could you slide your shorts down 
		please, Mr.  Lebowski?

The Dude's eyes open.

				DUDE
		Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.

				VOICE
		I understand sir.  Could you slide 
		your shorts down please?

DUDE'S CAR

The Dude is driving home.  A Creedence tape plays.  The Dude 
is sucking down a joint.  He glances at the rear-view mirror--
and, noticing something, looks again.

HIS POV

A Volkswagon bug is following, a lone fat man driving.

THE DUDE

His eyes still on the mirror, he absently takes the joint 
between thumb and forefinger of his right hand and flicks it 
out the driver's window--except that the window is not open.  
The butt bounces off the glass and around the car, showering 
sparks.

DUDE'S CROTCH

The glowing butt rolls down the car seat between his legs. 
The Dude screams.

THE STREET

The car careens wildly as the surrounding traffic veers off 
to, make way, horns blaring.  The car finally spins and comes 
to rest with its passenger side wrapped into a telephone 
poll.

INSIDE THE CAR

The Dude frantically grabs at his door, which won't open, 
and then slides over to push at the passenger door, which 
also won't open.

				DUDE
		Fuck Me.

But he is sitting on the passenger  side now,  away from  
the lit butt.  He looks around for it.

Smoke is wisping up from between the Driver's seat cushion 
and back cushion.

				DUDE
		Fuckola, man.

He takes his beer and pours it in between the cushions.   
There is a hissing  sound.   But there is a piece of paper 
sticking out from between the cushions.

The Dude pulls it out.

It is lined spiral notebook paper, slightly singed and 
dripping beer, covered with handwriting.  In the upper right-
hand corner is the name Lawrence Sellers, and under that, 
Mrs. Jamtoss 5th Period.  The theme is titled "The Louisiana 
Purchase."  In red ink is a large circled D and some 
handwritten marginal comments; misspelled words are circled 
in red throughout.

CRANE JACKSON'S FOUNTAIN STREET THEATER

We are behind Walter, the Dude, and Donny, facing the stage 
in the background where Allan, the Dude's balding landlord, 
is performing a dance moderne.

As Walter talks to the Dude he leans in to him, his voice 
hushed, so as not to disturb the rest of the very sparse 
audience.

				WALTER
		He lives in North Hollywood on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DUDE
		The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.

				WALTER
		Near the In-and-Out Burger--

				DONNY
		Those are good burgers, Walter.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  This kid 
		is in the ninth grade, Dude, and his 
		father is--are you ready for this?--
		Arthur Digby Sellers.

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is that?

				WALTER
		Huh?

				DUDE
		Who the fuck is Arthur Digby Sellers?

				WALTER
		Who the f--have you ever heard of a 
		little show called Branded, Dude?

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		All but one man died?  There at Bitter 
		Creek?

				DUDE
		Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show 
		Walter, so what?

				WALTER
		Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 
		156 episodes, Dude.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		The bulk of the series.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		Not exactly a lightweight.

				DUDE
		No.

				WALTER
		And yet his son is a fucking dunce.

				DUDE
		Uh.

				WALTER
		Yeah, go figure.  Well we'll go out 
		there after the, uh, the.

He waves a hand vaguely toward the stage.

				WALTER
		What have you.  We'll, uh--

				DONNY
		We'll be near the In-and-Out Burger.

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  We'll, uh, 
		brace the kid--he'll be a pushover.  
		We'll get that fucking money, if he 
		hasn't spent it already.  Million 
		fucking clams. And yes, we'll be 
		near the, uh--some burgers, some 
		beers, a few laughs.  Our fucking 
		troubles are over, Dude.

RESIDENTIAL AREA

The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated 
house sitting on a scrubby lot.  Parked incongruously in 
front of the house is a brand new red Corvette.

				DUDE
		Fuck me, man!  That kid's already 
		spent all the money!

				WALTER
		Hardly Dude, a new 'vette?  The kid's 
		still got, oh, 96 to 97 thousand, 
		depending on the options.  Wait in 
		the car, Donny.

THE FRONT DOOR

Walter rings the bell.  It is opened by a matronly Spanish 
woman.

				WOMAN
		Jace?

				WALTER
		Hello, Pilar?  My name is Walter 
		Sobchak, we spoke on the phone, this 
		is my associate Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WOMAN
		Jace.

				WALTER
		May we uh, we wanted to talk about 
		little Larry.  May we come in?

				WOMAN
		Jace.

They enter a dim living room and stand, looking about, as 
Pilar

CALLS UP THE STAIRS:

				PILAR
		Larry!  Sweetie!  Dat mang is here!

There is a rhythmic compressor sound; Walter places it and 
nudges the Dude.  At the other end of the living room a man 
lies on something that looks like a hospital gurney with its 
midsection enclosed by a motorized stainless-steel bubble.  
It is an iron lung, artificially breathing with distinct 
hisses in and out.

				WALTER
		That's him, Dude.

				VIVA VOCE
		And a good day to you, sir.

				PILAR
		See down, please.

				WALTER
		Thank you, ma'am.

He and the Dude sit on a sagging green sofa.  In a lowered 
voice, to Pilar:

				WALTER
		Does he, uh. . . Is he still writing?

				PILAR
		No, no.  He has healt' problems.

				WALTER
		Uh-huh.

HE BELLOWS ACROSS THE ROOM:

				WALTER
		I just want to say, sir, that we're 
		both enormous--on a personal level, 
		Branded, especially the early 
		episodes, has been a source of, uh, 
		inspir---

There are footsteps on the stairs.  Larry, a fifteen-year-
old, looks at the two men.

				PILAR
		See down, Sweetie.  These are the 
		policeman--

				WALTER
		No ma'am, I didn't mean to give the 
		impression that we're police exactly.  
		We're hoping that it will not be 
		necessary to call the police.

He adopts his command voice in turning to Larry:

				WALTER
		But that is up to little Larry here.  
		Isn't it, Larry?

Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out 
the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag.  He holds it out 
at arm's length, displaying it to Larry.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

Larry does not respond.

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Look, man, did you--

				WALTER
		Dude, please!. . .  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Just ask him if he--ask him about 
		the car, man!

Walter is still holding out the homework.

				WALTER
		Is this yours, Larry?  Is this your 
		homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		Is the car out front yours?

				WALTER
		Is this your homework, Larry?

				DUDE
		We know it's his fucking homework, 
		Walter!  Where's the fucking money, 
		you little brat?

Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework 
extended towards him.

				WALTER
		Look, Larry. . . Have you ever heard 
		of Vietnam?

				DUDE
		Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!

				WALTER
		You're going to enter a world of 
		pain, son.  We know that this is 
		your homework.  We know you stole a 
		car--

				DUDE
		And the fucking money!

				WALTER
		And the fucking money.  And we know 
		that this is your homework, Larry.

No answer.

				WALTER
		You're gonna KILL your FATHER, Larry!.

FINALLY, IN DISGUST:

				WALTER
		Ah, this is pointless.

As he shoves the homework back in the attache case:

				WALTER
		All right, Plan B.  You might want 
		to watch out the front window there, 
		Larry.

He is heading for the door.  The Dude, puzzled, rises to 
follow him.

				WALTER
		This is what happens when you FUCK a 
		STRANGER in the ASS, Larry.

OUTSIDE

Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like 
an enraged encyclopedia salesman.  Without looking back at, 
the Dude, who follows:

				WALTER
		Fucking language problem, Dude.

He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes 
out a tire iron.

				WALTER
		Maybe he'll understand this.

He is walking over to the Corvette.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!  He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which 
shatters.

				WALTER
		YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS?!

CRASH!  He takes out the driver's window.

				WALTER
		THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU FUCK A 
		STRANGER IN THE ASS!

Lights are going on in houses down the street.  Distant dogs 
bark.

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS, LARRY!

CRASH!

				WALTER
		HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS!  FUCK A STRANGER 
		IN THE ASS!

CRASH!

A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over 
behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of 
the crowbar.

				MAN
		WHAT THE FUCK JOO DOING, MANG?!

He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter.

				MAN
		I JUS' BAWDEEZ FUCKEEN CAR LASS WEEK!

Walter cringes before the enraged Mexican.

				WALTER
		Hunh?

The man looks about, wildly.

				MAN
		I KILL JOO, MANG!  I--I KILL JOR 
		FUCKEEN CAR!

He runs over to the Dude's car.

				DUDE
		No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--

CRASH!  CRASH!

				MAN
		I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

CRASH!

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

INSIDE THE CAR

Glass rains in on a terrified, cringing, Donny.

				MAN
		I KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!

					  ON A DEAFENING CRASH WE CUT TO:

THE DUDE'S CAR

We are looking into the car through the broken windshield as 
it rattles down the freeway.  Wind whistles through the caved-
in windows.

The Dude drives, his jaw clenched, staring grimly out at the

road.  Walter, beside him, and Donny in the back seat, munch 
'on In-and-Out Burgers.

Creedence music plays above the bluster of wind.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

As the Dude talks on the phone he is hammering a two-by-four 
into the floor just inside, and parallel to, the front door.

				DUDE
		I accept your apology. . . No I, I 
		just want to handle it myself from 
		now on. . . No.  That has nothing to 
		do with it. . . .Yes, it made it 
		home, I'm calling from home.  No, 
		Walter, it didn't look like Larry 
		was about to crack.

He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair 
that stands nearby.

				DUDE
		Well that's your perception. . . 
		Well you're right, Walter, and the 
		unspoken Message is FUCK YOU AND 
		LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE. . . Yeah, 
		I'll be at practice.

He hangs up and has just finished sliding the chair into 
place with its top under the doorknob and its legs braced 
against the two-by-four, thus wedging the door closed, when 
the door is opened--outwards.  The chair clatters to the 
floor.

				DUDE
		Huh?

Woo and the blond man who earlier peed on the rug stride in, 
kicking the chair away.

				WOO
		Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie
		Treehorn wants to see you.

				BLOND MAN
		And we know which Lebowski you are, 
		Lebowski.

				WOO
		Yeah.  Jackie Treehorn wants to talk 
		to the deadbeat Lebowski.

				BLOND MAN
		You're not dealing with morons here.

BLACKNESS

Out of the blackness something is falling toward us.  It is 
a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her 
mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy.  She is topless.  
She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a 
beat reappears, rising into the night sky.

MALIBU BEACH

A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried 
hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual 
attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in 
nightmarish slow motion.

WIDER

It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing 
kerosene heaters.  1960's mainstream jazz, of the Mancini-
Brubeck school, has been piped down to speakers on the beach'.

In long shot now the woman rises, squealing, disappears  
into darkness, descends into light, rises again.

A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach 
light.  He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants 
and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the 
neck.  Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and 
disappears.

				MAN
		Hello Dude, thanks for coming.  I'm 
		Jackie Treehorn.

INSIDE THE BEACH HOUSE

The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor.

				DUDE
		This is quite a pad you got here, 
		man.  Completely unspoiled.

				TREEHORN
		What's your drink, Dude?

				DUDE
		White Russian, thanks.  How's the 
		smut business, Jackie?

				TREEHORN
		I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in 
		publishing, entertainment, political 
		advocacy, and--

				DUDE
		Which one was Logjammin'?

				TREEHORN
		Regrettably, it's true, standards 
		have fallen in adult entertainment.  
		It's video, Dude.  Now that we're 
		competing with the amateurs, we can't 
		afford to invest that little extra 
		in story, production value, feeling.

He taps his forehead with one finger.

				TREEHORN
		People forget that the brain is the 
		biggest erogenous zone--

				DUDE
		On you, maybe.

He hands him the drink.

				TREEHORN
		Of course, you do get the good with 
		the bad.  The new technology permits 
		us to do exciting things with 
		interactive erotic software.  Wave 
		of the future, Dude.  100% electronic.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.  Well, I still jerk off 
		manually.

				TREEHORN
		Of course you do.  I can see you're 
		anxious for me to get to the point.  
		Well Dude, here it is.  Where's Bunny?

				DUDE
		I thought you might know, man.

				TREEHORN
		Me?  How would I know?  The only 
		reason she ran off was to get away 
		from her rather sizable debt to me.

				DUDE
		But she hasn't run off, she's been--

Treehorn waves this off.

				TREEHORN
		I've heard the kidnapping story, so 
		save it.  I know you're mixed up in 
		all this, Dude, and I don't care 
		what you're trying to take off her 
		husband.  That's your business.  All 
		I'm saying is, I want mine.

				DUDE
		Yeah, well, right man, there are 
		many facets to this, uh, you know, 
		many interested parties.  If I can 
		find your money, man-- what's in it 
		for the Dude?

				TREEHORN
		Of course, there's that to discuss.  
		Refill?

				DUDE
		Does the Pope shit in the woods?

				TREEHORN
		Let's say a 10% finder's fee?

				DUDE
		Okay, Jackie, done.  I like the way 
		you do business.  Your money is being 
		held by a kid named Larry Sellers.  
		He lives in North Hollywood, on 
		Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger.  
		A real fuckin' brat, but I'm sure 
		your goons'll be able to get it off 
		him, mean he's only fifteen and he's 
		flunking social studies.  So if you'll 
		just write me a check for my ten per 
		cent. . . of half a million. . . 
		fifty grand.

He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily.

				DUDE
		I'll go out and mingle.--Jesus, you 
		mix a hell of a Caucasian, Jackie.

The Dude shakes his head, tries to focus.

				TREEHORN
		A fifteen-year-old?  Is this your 
		idea of a joke?

Jackie Treehorn's image starts to swim.  He is joined on 
either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking 
grimly down at the Dude.

				DUDE
		No funny stuff, Jackie. . . the kid's 
		got it.  Hiya, fellas. . . kid just 
		wanted a car.  All the Dude ever 
		wanted. . . was his rug back. . . 
		not greedy. . . it really.

He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus.  
Tied the room together.

He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table.

FROM UNDER THE GLASS COFFEE TABLE

Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and 
squishes.

FAST FADE OUT

BLACK

				THE STRANGER'S VOICE
		Darkness warshed over the Dude--
		darker'n a black steer's tookus on a 
		moonless prairie night.  There was 
		no bottom.

We hear a thundering bass.

SCRATCHY WHITE TITLE CARD:

JACKIE TREEHORN PRESENTS

ANOTHER TITLE CARD:

THE DUDE

AND

MAUDE LEBOWSKI

IN

THIRD TITLE CARD:

GUTTERBALLS

The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked 
by a pair of  bowling balls.   The  bending bass sound turns  
into the lead-in to Kenny Rogers and the First Edition's  
"Just Dropped In."

The Dude is walking down a long corridor dressed as a cable 
repairman.  The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light 
as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley.

In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing 
operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song.  She wears an 
armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, 
and holds a trident.

The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps 
her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball.

The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini- 
skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs 
turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the 
end.

But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their 
legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, 
the tools from his utility belt swinging free.  He is face 
down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides.

His point of view shows the lane rushing by below, the little 
ball-guide arrows zipping by.

The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so 
that he is now gliding along the lane face-up.

Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing 
chorines.

The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so 
that he is once again gliding face-down.  He looks forward 
and his forward momentum blows back his hair.

Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, 
are the approaching pins.  We hit the pins, scattering them,  
and rush on into black.

A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless 
woman, squealing, her legs kicking.

As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three 
men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool 
of light.  It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding 
oversized shears which they menacingly scissor.

The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the 
advancing Germans.  He turns and runs, fists pumping.

The scissoring sound of the shears turns into the whoosh of 
car-bys.  The field of black is punctured by headlights.  
The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific 
Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring.

With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with 
flashing gumballs pulls up.

SQUAD CAR

The Dude sits in the back seat, his head lolling with the 
motion of the car as he blearily sings the theme of Branded:

				DUDE
		He was innocent.  Not a charge was 
		true.  And they say he ran awaaaaaay.

CHIEF'S OFFICE

The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces 
off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair.

His wallet is tossed onto the desk.

The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through 
it with disgusted incredulity.

				CHIEF
		This is your only I.D.?

He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card.
				DUDE
		I know my rights.

				CHIEF
		You don't know shit, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		I want a fucking lawyer, man.  I 
		want Bill Kunstler.

				CHIEF
		What are you, some kind of sad-assed 
		refugee from the fucking sixties?

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to 
		eject you from his garden party, 
		that you were drunk and abusive.

				DUDE
		That guy treats women like objects, 
		man.

				CHIEF
		Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in 
		this town, Lebowski.  You don't draw 
		shit.  We got a nice quiet beach 
		community here, and I aim to keep it 
		nice and quiet.  So let me make 
		something plain.  I don't like you 
		sucking around bothering our citizens, 
		Lebowski.  I don't like your jerk-
		off name, I don't like your jerk-off 
		face, I don't like your jerk- off 
		behavior, and I don't like you, jerk-
		off --do I make myself clear?

The Dude stares.

				DUDE
		I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude.  It 
hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee 
splashing everywhere.

The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk.

				DUDE
		--Ow!  Fucking fascist!

The Chief slaps him twice.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, Lebowski!

He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts 
kicking at him.

				CHIEF
		Stay out of Malibu, deadbeat!  Keep 
		your ugly fucking goldbricking ass 
		out of my beach community!

CAB

The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks 
with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his 
face and scalp.

"Peaceful Easy Feeling" is on the radio.

DUDE'S POV

The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds 
under a knit cap.

				DUDE
		Jesus, man, can you change the 
		station?

				DRIVER
		Fuck you man!  You don't like my 
		fucking music, get your own fucking 
		cab!

				DUDE
		I've had a--

				DRIVER
		I pull over and kick your ass out, 
		man!

				DUDE
		--had a rough night, and I hate the 
		fucking Eagles, man--

				DRIVER
		That's it!  Outta this fucking cab!

THE STREET

The cab screeches over towards the curb.  Another car, 
oncoming, its radio blaring Metallica, speeds by.

INSIDE THE OTHER CAR

It is a red convertible.  The driver, singing loudly and 
badly along with the radio, her hair blowing in the wind, a 
dreamy smile on her face as she speeds along, higher than a 
kite, is Bunny Lebowski.

THE FOOTWELL

On the accelerator her right foot, in an open-toed bright 
red high-heeled shoe, has five painted toes.

When she downshifts her left foot enters to engage the clutch.

Five more toes.

DUDE'S BUNGALOW

The Dude staggers in the open front door, one hand pressed 
to a lump on his forehead, and looks around.

				DUDE
		Jesus.

The place is a wreck.  Furniture has been overturned, 
upholstery slashed, drawers dumped.

Quiet.

The door to the bedroom starts to creak open.

The Dude cringes.

Maude emerges from the bedroom.  She is wearing a bathrobe.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Maude?

She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches.

				MAUDE
		Love me.

The Dude is stupefied.

				DUDE
		That's my robe.

					 THOOMP!  ON THE EMBRACE WE CUT TO:

BLACK

After a beat, a long sigh, and then a voice from the 
blackness:

				MAUDE
		Tell me a little about yourself, 
		Jeffrey.

				DUDE
		Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.

A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting 
himself a joint.  He shakes the match out to restore blackness 
except for the glowing tip of the joint.

				DUDE
		I was, uh, one of the authors of the 
		Port Huron Statement.--The original 
		Port Huron Statement.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Not the compromised second draft.  
		And then I, uh. . . Ever hear of the 
		Seattle Seven?

				MAUDE
		Mmnun.

Click--the Dude turns on a bedside lamp.  He and Maude lie 
next to each other in bed.

				DUDE
		And then. . . let's see, I uh--music 
		business briefly.

				MAUDE
		Oh?

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Roadie for Metallica.  Speed 
		of Sound Tour.

				MAUDE
		Uh-huh.

				DUDE
		Bunch of assholes.  And then, you 
		know, little of this, little of that. 
		My career's, uh, slowed down a bit 
		lately.

				MAUDE
		What do you do for fun?

				DUDE
		Oh, you know, the usual.  Bowl.  
		Drive around.  The occasional acid 
		flashback.

He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it.  She wedges a 
pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each 
kneecap.  She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep 
her pelvis raised.

				MAUDE
		What happened to your house?

				DUDE
		Jackie Treehorn trashed the place.  
		Wanted to save the finder's fee.

				MAUDE
		Finder's fee?

				DUDE
		He thought I had your father's money, 
		so he got me out of the way while he 
		looked for it.

				MAUDE
		It's not my father's money, it's the 
		Foundation's.  Why did he think you 
		had it?  And who does?

				DUDE
		Larry Sellers, a high-school kid.  
		Real fucking brat.

He picks a White Russian off the bedside table.

				MAUDE
		Jeffrey--

				DUDE
		It's a complicated case, Maude.  
		Lotta ins, lotta outs.  Fortunately 
		I've been adhering to a pretty strict, 
		uh, drug regimen to keep my mind, 
		you know, limber.  I'm real fucking 
		close to your father's money, real 
		fucking close.  It's just--

				MAUDE
		I keep telling you, it's the 
		Foundation's money.  Father doesn't 
		have any.

				DUDE
		Huh?  He's fucking loaded.

				MAUDE
		No no, the wealth was all Mother's.

				DUDE
		But your father--he runs stuff, he--

				MAUDE
		We did let Father run one of the 
		companies, briefly, but he didn't do 
		very well at it.

				DUDE
		But he's--

				MAUDE
		He helps administer the charities 
		now, and I give him a reasonable 
		allowance.  He has no money of his 
		own.  I know how he likes to present 
		himself; Father's weakness is vanity.  
		Hence the slut.

				DUDE
		Huh.  Jeez.  Well, so, did he--is 
		that yoga?

Throughout, Maude has been lying on her back with her knees 
pulled in.

				MAUDE
		It increases the chances of 
		conception.

The Dude spits some White Russian.

				DUDE
		Increases?

				MAUDE
		Well yes, what did you think this 
		was all about?  Fun and games?

				DUDE
		Well...no, of course not--

				MAUDE
		I want a child.

				DUDE
		Yeah, okay, but see, the Dude--

				MAUDE
		Look, Jeffrey, I don't want a partner.  
		In fact I don't want the father to 
		be someone I have to see socially, 
		or who'll have any interest in rearing 
		the child himself.

				DUDE
		Huh...

Something occurs to him.

				DUDE
		So...that doctor.

				MAUDE
		Exactly.  What happened to your face?  
		Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

The Dude is staring off into space, thinking.  His answer is 
absent.

				DUDE
		No, the, uh, police chief of Malibu.  
		A real reactionary. . . So your 
		father. . . Oh man, I get it!

				MAUDE
		What?

The Dude is leaving the bedroom.

				DUDE
		Yeah, my thinking about the case, 
		man, it had become uptight.  Yeah.  
		Your father--

LIVING ROOM

The Dude finishes punching a number into the phone.

				PHONE VOICE
		This is Walter Sobchak.  I'm not in; 
		leave a message after the beep.

FROM THE BEDROOM:

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		What're you talking about?

Beep.

				DUDE
		Walter, if you're there, pick up the 
		fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, 
		this is an emergency.  I'm not--

				WALTER
		Dude?

				DUDE
		Walter, listen, I'm at my place, I 
		need you to come pick me up--

				WALTER
		I can't drive, Dude, it's erev 
		shabbas.

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		Erev shabbas.  I can't drive.  I'm 
		not even supposed to pick up the 
		phone, unless it's an emergency.

				DUDE
		It is a fucking emergency.

				WALTER
		I understand.  That's why I picked 
		up the phone.

				DUDE
		THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, 
		just call Donny then, and ask him to--

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm not supposed to make calls--

				DUDE
		WALTER, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WE GOTTA 
		GO TO PASADENA!  COME  PICK ME UP OR 
		I'M OFF THE FUCKING BOWLING TEAM!

				MAUDE'S VOICE
		Jeffrey?

THE DUDE

He emerges on his front stoop, pulling on a shirt. His 
attention is caught by something down the street.

HIS POV

A car is  parked halfway down the block.  We can see the 
shape of a fat man in the driver's seat.

THE DUDE

Striding purposefully down the street.

HIS POV

The fat man leans forward and we hear the sound of the car's 
ignition coughing, but the engine will not turn over.  More 
whines and coughs; no start.

The man hurriedly fumbles in front of him.  He brings up a 
newspaper, which he holds before his face.

THE DUDE

As he gets to the car.  He reaches through the open driver's 
window and grabs the newspaper and hurls it to the ground.  
He is revved with nervous energy.

				DUDE
		Get out of that fucking car, man!

The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's 
movement as he gets out.

The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch.

He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a 
short fringe and a mustache.

The Dude shouts to cover his fear:

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, 
		man!

				MAN
		Relax, man!  No physical harm 
		intended!

				DUDE
		Who the fuck are you?  Why've you 
		been following me?  Come on, fuckhead!

				MAN
		Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus.

The Dude is stunned.

				DUDE
		Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk?

				MAN
		Irish m--What the fuck are you talking 
		about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a 
		private snoop!  Like you, man!

				DUDE
		Huh?

				DA FINO
		A dick, man!  And let me tell you 
		something: I dig your work. Playing 
		one side against the other--in bed 
		with everybody--fabulous stuff, man.

				DUDE
		I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay 
		away from my fucking lady friend, 
		man.

				DA FINO
		Hey hey, I'm not messing with your 
		special lady--

				DUDE
		She's not my special lady, she's my 
		fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping 
		her conceive, man!

				DA FINO
		Hey, man, I'm not--

				DUDE
		Who're you working for?  Lebowski?  
		Jackie Treehorn?

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.

				DUDE
		The?  Who the fff--

				DA FINO
		The Gundersons.  It's a wandering 
		daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man.  
		Her real name is Fawn Gunderson.  
		Her parents want her back.

He is fumbling in his wallet.

				DA FINO
		See?

The Dude looks at the picture.

It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but 
fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and 
straight Partridge Family hair and bangs.

				DUDE
		Jesus fucking Christ.

				DA FINO
		Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.

He is holding out another picture.

The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her.  
The family farm.

A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat 
snow-swept landscape.

Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her 
homesick.

				DUDE
		Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on 
		the farm once they seen Karl Hungus.

He hands back the picture.

She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's 
definitely not around.

				DA FINO
		Fuck, man!  That's terrible!

				DUDE
		Yeah, it sucks.

				DA FINO
		Well maybe you and me could pool our 
		resources--trade information--
		professional courtesy--compeers, you 
		know--

We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an 
approaching car.

				DUDE
		Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino.  
		And stay away from my special la--
		from my fucking lady friend.

The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its 
passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and 
yapping.

DENNY'S

Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in 
black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde 
hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless 
tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, 
and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and 
arms.

Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage-
swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of 
the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German.   
They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad 
and pen.

				WAITRESS
		You folks ready?

The German shouting stops.  Dieter looks sourly up.

				DIETER
		I haff lingenberry pancakes.

				KIEFFER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

				FRANZ
		Sree picks in blanket.

The woman speaks to Dieter in German.  He nods.

				DIETER
		Lingenberry pancakes.

WALTER'S CAR

Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the 
Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from 
the back seat.

				DUDE
		I mean we totally fucked it up, man.  
		We fucked up his pay-off.  And got 
		the kidnappers all pissed off, and 
		the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, 
		but he didn't do anything.  Huh?

				WALTER
		Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, 
		uh.

				DUDE
		I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck-
		up, then why does he still leave me 
		in charge of getting back his wife?  
		Because he fucking doesn't want her 
		back, man!  He's had enough!  He no 
		longer digs her!  It's all a show!  
		But then, why didn't he give a shit 
		about his million bucks?  I mean, he 
		knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, 
		but he never asked for it back.

				WALTER
		What's your point, Dude?

				DUDE
		His million bucks was never in it, 
		man!  There was no money in that 
		briefcase!  He was hoping they'd 
		kill her!  You throw out a ringer 
		for a ringer!

				WALTER
		Yeah?

				DUDE
		Shit yeah!

				WALTER
		Okay, but how does all this add up 
		to an emergency?

				DUDE
		Huh?

				WALTER
		I'm saying, I see what you're getting 
		at, Dude, he kept the money, but my 
		point is, here we are, it's shabbas, 
		the sabbath, which I'm allowed to 
		break only if it's a matter of life 
		and death--

				DUDE
		Walter, come off it.  You're not 
		even fucking Jewish, you're--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?

				DUDE
		You're fucking Polish Catholic--

				WALTER
		What the fuck are you talking about?  
		I converted when I married Cynthia!  
		Come on, Dude!

				DUDE
		Yeah, and you were--

				WALTER
		You know this!

				DUDE
		And you were divorced five fucking 
		years ago.

				WALTER
		Yeah?  What do you think happens 
		when you get divorced?  You turn in 
		your library card?  Get a new driver's 
		license?  Stop being Jewish?

				DUDE
		This driveway.

AS HE TURNS:

				WALTER
		I'm as Jewish as fucking Tevye

				DUDE
		It's just part of your whole sick 
		Cynthia thing.  Taking care of her 
		fucking dog.  Going to her fucking 
		synagogue.  You're living in the 
		fucking past.

				WALTER
		Three thousand years of beautiful 
		tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax--
		YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I LIVE IN THE 
		PAST!   I--Jesus.  What the hell 
		happened?

He is looking off as the car slows.  The Dude looks where 
Walter is looking.

THE LEBOWSKI MANSION

Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he 
and the Dude get out.

Both are gaping off at the front lawn.

				WALTER
		Jesus Christ.

THEIR POV

Tire treads lead across the manicured front lawn to where a 
little red sports car rests with its hood crumpled into a 
palm trunk.

TRACKING DOWN THE GREAT HALLWAY

Through the French doors at its far end we can see Bunny, 
naked, briefly bouncing on the diving board before splashing 
into the illuminated pool outside.  Heavy metal music filters 
in from a boom box by the pool.

Brandt, approaching, stoops and straightens, stoops and 
straightens, picking up the discarded clothes that run the 
length of the hall.

				BRANDT
		He can't see you, Dude.

We pull the Dude and Walter as they approach the doors to 
the great study.  Walter's dog follows, stiffly waving its 
tail.

				DUDE
		Where'd she been?

				BRANDT
		Visiting friends of hers in Palm 
		Springs.  Just picked up and left, 
		never bothered to tell us.

				DUDE
		But I guess she told Dieter.

				WALTER
		Jesus, Dude!  He never even kidnapped 
		her.

				BRANDT
		Who's this gentleman, Dude?

				WALTER
		Who'm I?  I'm a fucking VETERAN!

				BRANDT
		You shouldn't go in there, Dude!  
		He's very angry!

BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into--

THE GREAT ROOM

The big Lebowski turns at the sound of the door.  His 
wheelchair hums as he spins it around.

				LEBOWSKI
			(bitterly)
		Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.

				DUDE
		Where's the money, Lebowski?

				WALTER
		A MILLION BUCKS FROM FUCKING NEEDY 
		LITTLE URBAN ACHIEVERS!  YOU ARE 
		SCUM, MAN!

The dog yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Who the hell is he?

				WALTER
		I'll tell you who I am!  I'm the guy 
		who's gonna KICK YOUR PHONY 
		GOLDBRICKING ASS!

				DUDE
		We know the briefcase was empty, 
		man.  We know you kept the million  
		bucks yourself.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well, you have your story, I have 
		mine.  I say I entrusted the money 
		to you, and you stole it.

				WALTER
		AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING 
		YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!

				DUDE
		You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped 
		and you could use it as a pretext to 
		make some money disappear.  All you 
		needed was a sap to pin it on, and 
		you'd just met me.  You thought, 
		hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone 
		the square community won't give a 
		shit about.

				LEBOWSKI
		Well?  Aren't you?

				DUDE
		Well. . . yeah.

				LEBOWSKI
		All right, get out.  Both of you.

				WALTER
		Look at that fucking phony, Dude!  
		Pretending to be a fucking 
		millionaire!

				LEBOWSKI
		I said out.  Now.

				WALTER
		Let me tell you something else.  
		I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, 
		and this guy is a fake.  A fucking 
		goldbricker.

He is crossing to Lebowski.

				WALTER
		This guy fucking walks.  I've never 
		been more certain of anything in my 
		life!

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me, mister!

Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski 
out of the wheelchair by his armpits.

				WALTER
		Walk, you fucking phony!

The big Lebowski waggles helplessly, his rubbery feet grazing 
the floor like a Raggedy Ann's.  The pomeranian gaily leaps 
and yaps.

				LEBOWSKI
		Put me down, you son of a bitch!

				DUDE
		Walter!

				WALTER
		It's all over, man!  We call your 
		fucking bluff!

				DUDE
		WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S 
		CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!

				WALTER
		Sure, I'll put him down, Dude.  RAUSS!
		ACHTUNG, BABY!!

He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the 
floor, weeping.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				LEBOWSKI
			(sobbing)
		You're bullies!  Cowards, both of 
		you!

Walter is abashed.  The Big Lebowski flails about on the 
floor.

				WALTER
		Oh, shit.

				DUDE
		He can't walk, Walter!

				WALTER
		Yeah, I can see that, Dude.

				LEBOWSKI
		You monsters!

				DUDE
		Help me put him back in his chair.

Walter moves to comply.

				WALTER
		Shit, sorry man.

THROUGH HIS TEARS:

				LEBOWSKI
		Stay away from me!  You bullies!  
		You and these women!  You won't leave 
		a man his fucking balls!

				DUDE
		Walter, you fuck!

				WALTER
		Shit, Dude, I didn't know.  I 
		wouldn't've done it if I knew he was 
		a fucking crybaby.

				DUDE
		We're sorry, man.  We're really sorry.

The Dude has picked up the Big Lebowski's plaid lap warmer 
and is frantically tucking it back in around his waist and 
batting the dog away.

				DUDE
		There ya go.  Sorry man.

Walter, puzzled, hands on hips, stands over the big Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Shit.  He didn't look like a spinal.

TEN PINS

Scattered at the cut.

DUDE AND WALTER

Each with a beer at the scoring table.

				WALTER
		Sure you'll see some tank battles.  
		But fighting in desert is very 
		different from fighting in canopy 
		jungle.

				DUDE
		Uh-huh.

				WALTER
		I mean 'Nam was a foot soldier's war 
		whereas, uh, this thing should be a 
		fucking cakewalk.  I mean I had an 
		M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking 
		tank.  Just me and Charlie, man, 
		eyeball to eyeball.

				DUDE
		Yeah.

				WALTER
		That's fuckin' combat.  The man in 
		the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy 
		fuckin' adversary.

				DONNY
		Who's in pyjamas, Walter?

				WALTER
		Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch 
		of fig-eaters with towels on their 
		heads tryin' to find reverse on a 
		Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--

				VOICE
		HEY!

The Dude and Walter look.

Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is 
restrained by O'Brien.

				QUINTANA
		What's this "day of rest" shit, man?!

Walter looks at him innocently.

				QUINTANA
		What is this bullshit, man?  I don't 
		fucking care!  It don't matter to 
		Jesus!  But you're not fooling me!  
		You might fool the fucks in the league 
		office, but you don't fool Jesus!  
		It's bush league psych-out stuff!  
		Laughable, man!  I would've fucked 
		you in the ass Saturday, I'll fuck 
		you in the ass next Wednesday instead!

				QUINTANA

He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him 
away.

				QUINTANA
		You got a date Wednesday, man!

Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his 
shades, watch him go.

				WALTER
		He's cracking.

BOWLING ALLEY PARKING LOT

Donny, Walter and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding 
his leatherette ball satchel.

				WALTER
		A tree of life, Dude.  To all who 
		cling to it.

They react to the droning synthesizer-based technopop coming 
from a boom box.

REVERSE

Dieter, Kieffer and Franz, in shiny black leather, stand in 
a line facing them in the all-but-deserted lot.  Behind them 
orange flames lick gently at the Dude's car, which has been 
put to the torch.  The orange flames glow on the men's 
creaking leather.  Next to the car are three motorcycles, 
parked in a neat row.  The Dude looks sadly at the burning 
car.

				DUDE
		They finally did it.  They killed my 
		fucking car.

				DIETER
		Vee vant zat money, Lebowski.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, uzzervize vee kill ze girl.

				FRANZ
		Ja, it seems you forgot our little 
		deal, Lebowski.

				DUDE
		You don't have the fucking girl, 
		dipshits.  We know you never did.  
		So you've got nothin' on my Johnson.

				DUDE

The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in 
German.  Under his breath:

				DONNY
		Are these the Nazis, Walter?

Walter answers, also sotto voce, his eyes still on the three 
men:

				WALTER
		They're nihilists, Donny, nothing to 
		be afraid of.

The Germans stop conferring.

				DIETER
		Vee don't care.  Vee still vant zat 
		money or vee fuck you up.

				KIEFFER
		Ja, vee still vant ze money.  Vee 
		sreaten you.

He pulls an uzi from under his coat.  It glints in the 
firelight.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.

Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans:

				WALTER
		There's no ransom if you don't have 
		a fucking hostage.  That's what ransom 
		is.  Those are the fucking rules.

				DIETER
		Zere ARE no ROOLZ!

				WALTER
		NO RULES!  YOU CABBAGE-EATING SONS-
		OF- BITCHES--

				KIEFFER
		His girlfriend gafe up her toe!  She 
		sought we'd be getting million 
		dollars!  Iss not fair!

				WALTER
		Fair!  WHO'S THE FUCKING NIHILIST 
		HERE!  WHAT ARE YOU, A BUNCH OF 
		FUCKING CRYBABIES?!

				DUDE
		Hey, cool it Walter.  Listen, pal, 
		there never was any money.  The big 
		Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase, 
		man, so take it up with him.

				WALTER
		AND I'D LIKE MY UNDIES BACK!

The Germans confer again, in German.

Donny is visibly frightened.

				DONNY
		Are they gonna hurt us, Walter?

WALTER 'S TONE IS GENTLE:

				WALTER
		They won't hurt us, Donny.  These 
		men are cowards.

THE CONFERENCE ENDS:

				DIETER
		Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on 
		you und vee call it eefen.

				WALTER
		Fuck you.

The Dude is digging into his pocket.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter, we're ending this 
		thing cheap.

Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's.

				WALTER
		What's mine is mine.

				DUDE
		Come on, Walter!.

Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet:

				DUDE
		Four dollars here!

He inspects the change in his palm.

				DUDE
		Almost five!

				DONNY
			(tremulously)
		I got eighteen dollars, Dude.

				WALTER
			(grimly)
		What's mine is mine.

With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!  VEE TAKE YOUR 
		MONEY!

				WALTER
			(coolly)
		Come and get it.

				DIETER
		VEE FUCK YOU UP, MAN!

				WALTER
		Come and get it.  Fucking nihilist.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

				WALTER
		Show me what you got.  Nihilist.  
		Dipshit with a nine-toed woman.

In a rage, Dieter charges.

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  I FUCK YOU!

WALTER

hurls his leather satchel.

KIEFFER

Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard.  The bowling 
ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet.

He falls back, his uzi clattering away.

WALTER

twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in 
both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes 
on Dieter's ear.

DUDE

He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate 
kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping.  Franz gives 
a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his 
arms up, evading the kicks.

WALTER

His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear.  Dieter draws his 
saber against Walter's side, drawing blood.

Walter doesn't react to the wound.  Growling as Dieter 
screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws 
clamped.

THE SABER

Dieter drops it.

DUDE

Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks.

WALTER

still worrying the ear.  With a tearing sound his head and 
Dieter's separate.

DIETER, EARLESS, SCREAMS:

				DIETER
		I FUCK YOU!  YOU CANNOT HURT ME!  I 
		BELIEF IN NUSSING!

Walter spits his ear into his face.

DUDE

The Dude and Franz, both now panting heavily, have yet to 
establish body contact.  Franz continues to kick.

				FRANZ
		VEAKLING!

WALTER

draws back his fist.

				DIETER
		NUSSING!

				WALTER
		ANTI-SEMITE!

Bam!--A powerhouse blow to the middle of his face drops Dieter 
for the count.

DUDE AND FRANZ

With a piercing shriek Franz finally summons the nerve to 
charge the Dude, hands raised to deliver karate blows.

As he reaches the Dude--WHHAP--the  boom box swings into  
frame to smash him in the face.  Its volume shoots up.

Walter bashes him a few more times over the head.  The music 
screeches to static, then quiet.  Laid out now, Franz too is 
quiet.

All quiet.

Walter, panting, looks around.

				WALTER
		We've got a man down, Dude.

With a hand pressed to his bleeding side he trots over to 
Donny, who lies gasping on the ground.

The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over.

				DUDE
		Hy God!  They shot him, Walter!

				WALTER
		No Dude.

				DUDE
		They shot Donny!

Donny gasps for air.  His eyes, wide, go from the Dude to 
Walter.  One hand still clutches his eighteen dollars.

				WALTER
		There weren't any shots.

				DUDE
		Then what's...

				WALTER
		It's a heart attack.

				DUDE
		Wha.

				WALTER
		Call the medics, Dude.

				DUDE
		Wha. . . Donny--

				WALTER
		Hurry Dude.  I'd go but I'm pumping 
		blood.  Might pass out.

The Dude runs into the lanes.  Walter lays a reassuring hand 
on Donny's shoulder.

				WALTER
		Rest easy, good buddy, you're doing 
		fine.  We got help choppering in.

FADE OUT

HOLD IN BLACK

THE DUDE AND WALTER

---

They sit side by side, forearms on knees, in a nondescript 
waiting area.  Walter bounces the fingertips of one hand off 
those of the other.  They sit.  They wait.

A tall thin man in a conservative black suit enters.  He 
eyes the Dude's bowling attire and sunglasses and Walter's 
army surplus, but doesn't make an issue of it.

				MAN
		Hello, gentlemen.  You are the 
		bereaved?

				DUDE
		Yeah man.

				MAN
		Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet 
		you.

				DUDE
		Jeffrey Lebowski.

				WALTER
		Walter Sobchak.

				DUDE
		The Dude, actually.  Is what, uh.

				DONNELLY
		Excuse me?

				DUDE
		Nothing.

				DONNELLY
		Yes.  I understand you're taking 
		away the remains.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

				DONNELLY
		We have the urn.

He nods through a door.  Another man in a black suit enters 
to carefully deposit a large silver urn on the desktop.

				DONNELLY
		And I assume this is credit card?

He is vaguely handing a large leather folder across the desk 
to whomever wants to take it.

				WALTER
		Yeah.

He takes it, opens it, puts on reading glasses that sit 
halfway down his nose, and inspects the bill with his head 
pulled back for focus and cocked for concentration.  Silence.  
The Dude smiles at Donnelly.  Donnelly gives back a 
mortician's smile.  At length Walter holds the bill towards 
Donnelly, pointing.

				WALTER
		What's this?

				DONNELLY
		That is for the urn.

				WALTER
		Don't need it.  We're scattering the 
		ashes.

				DONNELLY
		Yes, so we were informed.  However, 
		we must of course transmit the remains 
		to you in a receptacle.

				WALTER
		This is a hundred and eighty dollars.

				DONNELLY
		Yes sir.  It is our most modestly 
		priced receptacle.

				DUDE
		Well can we--

				WALTER
		A hundred and eighty dollars?!

				DONNELLY
		They range up to three thousand.

				WALTER
		Yeah, but we're--

				DUDE
		Can we just rent it from you?

				DONNELLY
		Sir, this is a mortuary, not a rental 
		house.

				WALTER
		We're scattering the fucking ashes!

				DUDE
		Walter--

				WALTER
		JUST BECAUSE WE'RE BEREAVED DOESN'T 
		MEAN WE'RE SAPS!

				DONNELLY
		Sir, please lower your voice--

				DUDE
		Hey man, don't you have something 
		else you could put it in?

				DONNELLY
		That is our most modestly priced 
		receptacle.

				WALTER
		GODDAMNIT!  IS THERE A RALPH'S AROUND 
		HERE?!

POINT DUME -- DAY

It is a high, wind-swept bluff.  Walter and the Dude walk 
towards the lip of the bluff.  Parked in the background is 
one lonely car, Walter's.

Walter is carrying a bright red coffee can with a blue plastic 
lid.  When they reach the edge the two men stand awkwardly 
for a beat.  Finally:

				WALTER
		I'll say a few words.

The Dude clasps his hands in front of him.  Walter clears 
his throat.

				WALTER
		Donny was a good bowler, and a good 
		man.  He was. . . He was one of us.  
		He was a man who loved the outdoors, 
		and bowling, and as a surfer explored 
		the beaches of southern California 
		from Redondo to Calabassos.  And he 
		was an avid bowler.  And a good 
		friend.  He died--he died as so many 
		of his generation, before his time.  
		In your wisdom you took him, Lord.  
		As you took so many bright flowering 
		young men, at Khe San and Lan Doc 
		and Hill 364.  These young men gave 
		their lives.  And Donny too.  Donny 
		who. . . who loved bowling.

Walter clears his throat.

				WALTER
		And so, Theodore--Donald--Karabotsos, 
		in accordance with what we think   
		your dying wishes might well have 
		been, we commit your mortal remains 
		to the bosom of.

Walter is peeling the plastic lid off the coffee can.

				WALTER
		the Pacific Ocean, which you loved 
		so well.

AS HE SHAKES OUT THE ASHES:

				WALTER
		Goodnight, sweet prince.

The wind has blown all of the ashes into the Dude, standing 
just to the side of and behind Walter. The Dude stands, 
frozen. Finished eulogizing, Walter looks back.

				WALTER
		Shit, I'm sorry Dude.

He starts brushing off the Dude with his hands.

				WALTER
		Goddamn wind.

Heretofore motionless, the Dude finally explodes, slapping 
Walter's hands away.

				DUDE
		Goddamnit Walter!  You fucking 
		asshole!

				WALTER
		Dude!  Dude, I'm sorry!

The Dude is near tears.

				DUDE
		You make everything a fucking 
		travesty!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm--it was an accident!

The Dude gives Walter a furious shove.

				DUDE
		What about that shit about Vietnam!

				WALTER
		Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		What the fuck does Vietnam have to 
		do with anything!  What the fuck 
		were you talking about?!

Walter for the first time is genuinely distressed, almost 
lost.

				WALTER
		Shit Dude, I'm sorry--

				DUDE
		You're a fuck, Walter!

He gives Walter a weaker shove.  Walter seems dazed, then 
wraps his arms around the Dude.

				WALTER
		Awww, fuck it Dude.  Let's go bowling.

THE LANES THE DUDE AND WALTER BOWLING

We watch each of them glide across the floor, release, follow 
through--gracefully.  We have never seen them bowl before.  
They are quite good.  Each wears a black armband on his 
bowling shirt.

BAR AREA

The Dude walks up to the bar.

				DUDE
		Two oat sodas, Gary.

				GARY
		Right.  Good luck tomorrow.

				DUDE
		Thanks, man.

				GARY
		Sorry to hear about Donny.

				DUDE
		Yeah.  Well, you know, sometimes you 
		eat the bear, and, uh.

"Tumbling Tumbleweeds" has come up on the jukebox, and The 
Stranger ambles up to the bar.

				THE STRANGER
		Howdy do, Dude.

				DUDE
		Oh, hey man, how are ya?  I wondered 
		if I'd see you again.

				THE STRANGER
		Wouldn't miss the semis.  How things 
		been goin'?

				DUDE
		Ahh, you know.  Strikes and gutters, 
		ups and downs.

The Stranger's eyes crinkle merrily.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure, I gotcha.

The bartender has put two gleaming beers on the counter.

				DUDE
		Thanks, Gary...Take care, man, I 
		gotta get back.

				THE STRANGER
		Sure.  Take it easy, Dude--I know 
		that you will.

THE DUDE, LEAVING, NODS:

				DUDE
		Yeah man.  Well, you know, the Dude 
		abides.

Gazing after him, The Stranger drawls, savoring the words:

				THE STRANGER
		The Dude abides.

He gives his head a shake of appreciation, then looks into 
the camera.

				THE STRANGER
		I don't know about you, but I take 
		comfort in that.  It's good knowin' 
		he's out there, the Dude, takin' her 
		easy for all us sinners.  Shoosh.  I 
		sure hope he makes The finals.  Welp, 
		that about does her, wraps her all 
		up.  Things seem to've worked out 
		pretty good for the Dude'n Walter, 
		and it was a purt good story, dontcha 
		think?   Made me laugh to beat the 
		band.  Parts, anyway.  Course--I 
		didn't like seein' Donny go. But 
		then, happen to know that there's a 
		little Lebowski on the way.  I guess 
		that's the way the whole durned human 
		comedy keeps perpetuatin' it-self, 
		down through the generations, westward 
		the wagons, across the sands a time 
		until-- aw, look at me, I'm ramblin' 
		again.  Wal, uh hope you folks enjoyed 
		yourselves.

He brushes his hat brim with a fingertip as we begin to pull 
back.

				THE STRANGER
		Catch ya further on down the trail.

As we pull away The Stranger swivels in to the bar.  As his 
voice fades:

				THE STRANGER
		...Say friend, ya got any more a 
		that good sarsaparilla?...

      FADE IN:

      EXT. ROAD - WINTER DAY

      A police car, nothing more than a speck on the landscape, is intermittently
      visible through the blowing snow.

      INT. POLICE CAR - SAME

      A CORPORAL (20s), behind the wheel, with a bored DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s)
      at his side.

                                  CORPORAL
              So his hand is like, off, right.  So he puts on a
              tourniquet, puts the hand in his pocket, walks five
              miles through the bush til he gets to the highway,
              where he passes out, on the road, right.  Then this
              logging truck comes along...

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
                        (looking ahead)
              Hey.

      The Corporal looks forward.

      CAR'S POV: Through the windshield of a WOMAN (40s), dressed in her
      pajamas and a parka, skipping down the middle of the road.

      EXT. ROAD

      The police car pulls to a stop, just as the woman does a pirouette and falls
      over backwards.

      Detective Boyle and the other Cop get out and walk over.

                                  CORPORAL
                        (into his radio)
              Dispatch, this is unit 611, we need a first
              responsder --

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Cancel that.

      The Woman kicks up a leg, wiggles her foot.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
              I know where she belongs.

      As they lift her up...

1     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON                                  1

      The dumpster lid opens on a bitterly cold, gray winter's day in an Alaskan city.  A
      chunky, shivering HAIR STYLIST with jet black bangs shakes out a box of
      conditioning samples.

                                  HAIR STYLIST
                        (to someone O.S.)
              She says "I haven't eaten all day," then, right there on
              the bus she pulls out this, like, salmon steak and
              I'm...

2     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON                                  2

      The dumpster lid BANGS shut, reopens a beat later. A moment of calm until
      two garbage bags SLAM against the inside of the lid. It falls shut with a CLANG.

3     EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                                    3

      The lid reopens. Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life. A middle
      aged MAN in work clothes checks to make sure he's alone. He gently lowers
      the lid, opens it again a moment later, this time balancing a mini-bar fridge on
      his shoulder.  He dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off.

4     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                           4

      The lid reopens.  SIRENS off in the distance...

                                  MEN'S VOICES (O.S.)
              One, two, three... up.

      The lifeless body of a fair-sized man comes CRASHING into the garbage.
      SIRENS closer.  A man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull some garbage
      over the corpse.  A second man looks in, then pulls the first man away.

                                  MAN'S VOICE
              We'll get him later.  C'mon.

      The lid drops.

5     EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - MORNING                                                  5

      Black.  The dumpster reopens. Morning now. A Korean-American  TEENAGER
      wearing an apron and headphones sings along to an  old KISS tune as he
      deposits two large orange garbage bags.

                                  TEENAGER
              "...Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet, get
              down, everybody's gonna leave their seat...gonna
              lose your mind in..."

      He shuts the lid with care.  Black.

6     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                                         6

      A cookie-cutter subdivision.  Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that
      blankets the neighborhood.  HOWARD (30s), a burly outdoors type, is trying to
      unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup.  TED WATTERS (late
      20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street. He stops by
      Howard's driveway.

                                  TED
              Need a hand?

                                  HOWARD
                        (turning)
              Yeah.  Could ya grab me those two by eights?

      Ted walks up the driveway, grabs the wood slats, makes a ramp by leaning
      them against the rear bumper.

                                  HOWARD (cont'd)
              Thanks.

      Howard maneuvers the snowmobile down the ramp, his back turned toward
      Ted -- who has taken out a small cam-corder and is taping Howard.

                                  HOWARD (cont'd)
              I tell ya, it may look fast but it sure ain't light.  You the
              guy who just moved in to the Stevens old house?

                                  TED
              No.  Name's Ted.

                                  HOWARD
              Hey Ted, I'm Howard.

                                  TED
              Hey Howard.  What is that, an Arctic Cat? What do
              those go for?

7     P.O.V. CAMCORDER VIEW FINDER                                                   7

      Howard finally has the snowmobile on the ground.  He's breathing heavy as he
      pulls off his mitt to shake hands.

                                  HOWARD
              More than I could normally afford, I'll tell ya.
                        (seeing the camera)
              Hey!  What do you think you're you doing?

      As Ted and Howard continue to talk, we PULL BACK to reveal we are watching
      Ted's video playing on a VCR that is --

8     INT. INSURANCE OFFICE / COMMON AREA - DAY                                      8

      A group of office WORKERS look on, very much impressed, as a stunned
      Howard stares at the camera.

                                  TED (O.S.)
              Howard, you seem like a reasonable kind of guy.
              Lets you and me talk.

      TIGHT ON: WATTERS at his nearby cubicle, typing frenetically on his computer.

      At first, he appears to be working, until we realize that on his computer screen
      pixilated Zombies die in silent anguish beneath an unholy hail of bullets.  A
      Miami Dolphins sticker is the sole cubicle decoration.

      As the tape finishes, a smattering of APPLAUSE from his colleagues.  Ted
      gives a small wave over the cubicle wall.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Thank you.  Just happy to give something back to
              Liberty Capital...
                        (to himself - bitter)
              After all they've done for me.

9     INT. INSURANCE OFFICE / COMMON AREA - DAY                                      9

      CAM (30s), Native-American Alaskan walks over. Ted immediately hits a key
      that turns the screen to a spread-sheet.

                                  CAM
              That was really cool.  It was like... watching "Cops".

                                  TED
              He was pretty spry for a man with a herniated disc.

                                  CAM
              You know, I don't want to bitch or anything, but you
              were supposed to take me along on that one.

                                  TED
              Couldn't find you.

                                  CAM
              I know you know this, but the sooner they think I can
              handle calls on my own, the sooner they'll kick you
              back down south.

                                  TED
              I've been hearing that for 13 months and six days,
              Cam.  After a while, it gets a little old.
                        (off Cam's look)
              Next time, okay.

      Good enough.  Cam moves off.  Back to the zombie blood bath.  The phone
      RINGS.  Ted picks up, his eyes never wavering from the gore intensive
      computer game.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Claims, Ted Watters.  Sure.

      A final key stroke separates one last zombie from its entrails.

10    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE / BRANCH'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER                       10

      TIGHT ON: A MOUNTED SALMON

      We PULL BACK to see the walls lined with souvenirs of a life spent on the
      edge of the wilderness; citations from the Rotarians, pictures of sponsored
      hockey teams... We are --

      FRANK BRANCH (50s), a mid-level management type sits across from PAUL
      BARNELL (40s), a mild-mannered everyman wrapped in a cheap suit.  Paul
      takes in the display.  The two men sit in silence, smiling politely at one another.

                                  PAUL
              That's... quite the fish.

      Branch is about to answer when Ted enters with a slim file.

                                  BRANCH
              Paul Barnell, Ted Watters.

      Handshakes.  Paul makes steady eye contact.  Ted notices.

                                  BRANCH (cont'd)
              Mr. Barnell wants to talk to us about his brother's life
              insurance policy.

      Ted sits and flips open the file.

                                  TED
              Raymond, isn't it?

                                  PAUL
              Yes, Raymond.  You see, as I've already explained to
              Mr. Branch, he's been gone for five years now, and I
              thought it might be time to... move on.

                                  TED
              By move on you mean...?

                                  BRANCH
              ...cash in Raymond's policy.

      Ted smiles to himself.

                                  PAUL
              I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive.
              My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after
              each other if anything should ever happen.  And to
              be frank, money's a little --

                                  TED
              I understand Mr. Barnell, but here's the thing. With no
              actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must
              be missing for seven years before he or she can be
              legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an
              investigation period where concerned parties can
              take up to another year to file interventions
              concerning the motion.  So, even though your
              brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's
              really very little we can do for you.

      Ted flips the file shut.  Case closed.  Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's
      demeanor, forces a smile.

                                  BRANCH
              Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss.

      Branch looks at Ted.  Ted turns to Paul.

                                  TED
              Oh, absolutely.

11    EXT.  STRIP MALL - NIGHT                                                      11

      The city skyline rises in the distance as heat vents belch steam against the
      rapidly setting sun.  But that's miles away.  Here on the outskirts is a rapidly
      failing five store strip mall; a "Porn-a-copia" XXX Video store, hair stylist,
      small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the "Barnell Great Escapes" 
      travel agency.  We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner.  Paul's car,
      a Ford Taurus, pulls onto the parking pad.

12    INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  12

      Paul driving, talking on his cell phone and balancing a big non-spill metallic
      travel coffee mug at the same time.

                                  PAUL
              Hang on, hang on.  First off, how did you get my cell
              number?  (Beat)  Because it's for mechanical and
              medical emergencies only.

      Paul, wound up, taps his brakes too hard.  His mug falls, the lid pops and the
      coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Great.
                        (back into phone)
              No, I'm not...  I just... give me a second here.

      Paul parks his car, gathers the soggy papers and gets out.

13    EXT. STRIP MALL                                                               13

      Paul, still on the phone, carries the papers to the dumpster.

                                  PAUL
              Yes, and that check went out a week ago.  I watched
              my secretary write it up.

14    EXT. INSIDE THE DUMPSTER                                                      14

      Black.  Paul opens the lid.  The phone is cradled in his neck, he checks each
      soggy page to make sure he's not tossing anything important.

                                  PAUL
              Well I don't know.  I, I, I have no clue.  Could it
              possibly be a problem on your end?  So the electric
              company never makes a...  Look, I pay my bills.  I'm a
              Rotarian for goodness --

      Paul looks over to see some MEN from Rodney's Repo Ranch walking up to
      the front door of his office.  Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls
      into the trash.

      Paul, muttering, leans in to get it.  He pushes aside an orange garbage bag,
      guided by the faint sound of the other person STILL TALKING. And then--

      PAUL'S POV: of THE BODY-- a 40-ish White (well, a little blue) male dressed in
      a cheap suit.  Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is
      talking.

                                  THE CELL PHONE
              Mr. Barnell?  Mr. Barnell?

15    EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL                                                15

      A SHOUT as Paul jumps back from the dumpster. The lid CRASHES down as
      he scrambles/slides away.  He takes a moment to compose himself, then
      realizes his phone is still in there.

      He opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and
      hurries off.  The lid CRASHES shut.

                                  PAUL
                        (into the phone)
              Hello?

      Hung up.  Paul dials 911, looks back at the dumpster, thinks for a second, then
      hits END.  He stands there, thinking.

A15   INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - LATER                                  A15

      Paul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the
      dumpster.  He can't take his eyes off it.

      Behind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and
      walking toward the door.  He's oblivious.

      At the sound of a TRUCK, his head snaps around.  It's a garbage truck, but
      instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road.  That's all it
      takes.

B15   EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL - MOMENTS LATER                               B15

      Paul backs his Ford Taurus up to the dumpster, pops the trunk, checks to
      make sure he's alone then steps up on the rear bumper, opens the lid and
      clambers inside.

16    INT. INSIDE A FRIDGE - LATER                                                  16

      Black.  The fridge door opens, the light revealing several cans of pop and beer
      in the foreground.  Behind the

      beverages, a garage where Paul struggles with the lifeless body.  He props the
      man against the hood of his car, gives him a quick once over, pockets, obvious
      wounds.  Nothing.

      Paul moves to the fridge, starts to pull things out.

17    INT. ATTACHED SUBURBAN GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                    17

      Jodie, an annoyingly small dog, enters the garage from the house and starts
      sniffing around the body.  A new chew toy!

                                  PAUL
                        (at the sound)
              Jodie, no!  Not for dogs!

      He SHOOS the dog back into the house.  Paul moves back to the fridge, opens
      the door and, with great effort picks up the dead man and tries to stuff him
      inside.  Only problem...

      The man's legs don't want to fit.  Paul leans down and grabs an uncooperative
      appendage.  He grits his teeth, looks away as he kicks at the knee.  It SNAPS
      sideways.

      Paul fights nausea.  But with the leg now out of joint, the man fits.  Paul,
      breathing heavy, leans against the door.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              OK then.  OK.

      He packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles.  Then, just before
      he shuts the door, Paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9
      (the coldest setting).

      A padlock and chain come from the base of a propane BBQ.  It goes around the
      fridge, the lock SNAPS it in place.  Paul spots some leftover drink cans.  He
      kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Hey Honey.  Any mail?

18    EXT. CITY ROADWAY - EVENING                                                   18

      Ted drives home through a wooded section of town.

A18   INT. TED'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  A18

      Ted checks out various radio stations, hating everything.  He lands on one
      playing "Escape (The piña Colada Song)" when he looks up and suddenly
      jams on the brakes.

B18   EXT. ROADWAY                                                                 B18

      Ted car slides toward a moose that has wandered into the middle of the road.
      The car stops about five feet away.

      The moose looks at Ted.  Ted looks back, wondering what he ever did to
      deserve the life he's stuck with.  After a moment, the moose lumbers off.  Ted
      drives on.

                                                                               CUT TO:

C18   INT TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                  C18

      TIGHT ON: A COMPUTER SCREEN where swirling signs of the Zodiac act as a
      screen saver.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL we are --

      A telephone cord runs from the computer to the headset of TIFFANY (20s), pert,
      smart and dressed in a tight University of Alaska T-shirt.  Tiffany sits with her
      feet up on the desk as she flips through a copy of "Cosmo".

      It's a medium sized apartment, littered with guy stuff although bowing to
      advancing signs of feminine influence.

      The phone RINGS.  Tiffany hits the space bar.  The caller's number flashes on
      screen.  By the second ring, an electronic timer kicks in and a complete file on
      the caller appears with name, address, background, pets...  She smiles, hits
      "enter."

                                  TIFFANY
                        (into her headset)
              Psychic Pals.  How are you today... Mr. Williams?
                        (pause - she listens)
              Well, we are all registered psychics here.  I just had
              a feeling you'd be calling.  What's up?

      A KEY IN THE DOOR.  A tired Ted walks inside.

                                  TED
              Hey Tiff.

      Tiffany looks up, then holds up a file folder with the words "WORKING -
      SHHHHHH!" in big black letters.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (to caller)
              Your TV remote control?  Okay.

      Ted SIGHS, gives her a quick peck on the cheek as he wrestles off his winter
      gear and heads to the kitchen.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              I need you to clear your mind...

      Ted looks into the fridge, making up new words to the song "Escape."

                                  TED
              "If you like frozen enchiladas, getting caught in the
              rain.  If you're not into...something brownish."

      Ted pulls out some Tupperware, tries to figure out what's in it.  Tiffany, still
      wearing her headset, appears behind him, grabs a Diet Coke from the fridge
      and kisses him on the cheek.

                                  TIFFANY
              It's stew.  I'm not sure it's still good.

                                  TED
              Aren't you with a customer?

                                  TIFFANY
              They're concentrating.

      Ted grabs a fork, takes the pot and sits at the table.  Tiffany goes back to her
      desk and flips through her magazine.

                                  TED
                        (through a mouthful of food)
              So?  How's the tea leaf business today?

                                  TIFFANY
              I've decided from now on to ignore you when you're
              ignorant about my work.  And it's going very well
              thank you.
                        (reconnecting to the caller)
              Mr. Williams, I'm seeing sofa cushions.  Do you have
              a sofa?  Good.  Glad I could help.

                                  TED
              You here from that software distributor guy?

                                  TIFFANY
              No, but I did crack that code problem.  You know how
              sometimes when you're running Beta versions you --

                                  TED
              English, please.

                                  TIFFANY
              There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it.
                        (another call comes in)
              Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol?  Now I
              thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not
              specifically in your coffee pot.

                                  TED
              Jeez, Tiff.

                                  TIFFANY
              Jeez, Ted.  Do I tell you how to do your job?

                                  TED
                        (kidding... kind of)
              No, but then again I'm not a computer aided pseudo
              psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence...

                                  TIFFANY
              Before you say anything else that may keep us from
              having sex ever again, let me ask you something...

      She picks up her magazine.

                                  TED
              Tiff, please.  I always get these wrong.

                                  TIFFANY
              That's why we keep trying.  Now, Love is Sacrifice
              test.
                        (reading)
              If you were in a life raft with me and there was only
              enough water --

                                  TED
              Don't you have a customer?

                                  TIFFANY
                        (to the caller)
              Carol?  God says he's busy with a famine right now,
              but you should keep praying.  Cool.

      She hangs up.  Turns back to Ted, about to pick up where she left off...

                                  TED
              No.  I'm not doing it.

                                  TIFFANY
              It's just a stupid quiz.

                                  TED
              Exactly.

      The PHONE RINGS.  Tiffany bolts to her desk, sits, spins in her chair as she
      answers the call.

                                  TIFFANY
              Psychic Pals.  Is this the first time you've called us
              Mrs...?

      Tiffany at her computer, enters the name "Margaret Barnell" into her database.
      Tiffany works a "mute" button as she points back to the magazine.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              But stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential
              relationship problems.
                        (to her caller)
              Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is an anxious
              day for you.

      Ted, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk.

                                  TED
              Our only relationship problem is you're running a
              $1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room.

                                  TIFFANY
              Don't call it a scam.
                        (to the caller - startled)
              Excuse me?

                                  TED
              What?

                                  TIFFANY
              You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret.
                        (to Ted - playful)
              You didn't just call this your living room, did you?

                                  TED
              I meant ours.  Ours, ours, ours.

      Tiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at Ted.

                                  TIFFANY
              I feel someone you really care about, maybe even
              the love of your life, is being a real pain.  Now I need
              you to concentrate...

      Ted pretends to do just that, drawing a giggle from Tiffany before he walks off.

22    INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - MORNING                                 22

      Paul tries to open the front door, but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow.
      Three good yanks and it finally opens. He enters the shop.

      Faded travel posters cover the walls.  AVIS (40s), a career office gal, smiles at
      her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha
      Airlines.  It features a

      dark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell.  The shell juts out of
      the display giving it a 3-D quality.

                                  AVIS
              Morning Mr. Barnell.  Coffee?

                                  PAUL
              Thanks Avis.  Looks good.

      Paul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air
      surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Was November this bad last year?

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk
              about?  Did you send the computer back?

      Paul moves to his desk.

                                  PAUL
              Yeah, it was not working.  Any calls?

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric.  I
              told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some
              people don't like to listen.

      Paul turns to look at the snow covered empty parking lot, then at a photo of his
      wife Margaret on his desk.  He mentally gathers himself.

                                  PAUL
              Something... strange happened last night Avis.

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              What was that?

                                  PAUL
              Did... you ever meet my brother Raymond?

                                  AVIS (O.S.)
              The one who went missing?

                                  PAUL
              Uh huh.  Well anyway last night there's a knock on
              the door and there's Raymond, just... standing there
              on the doorstep.

      Avis arrives with the coffee and the mail.

                                  AVIS
              Didn't you have him declared...?

                                  PAUL
              Dead?  No.  I mean, they said he hadn't been gone
              long enough.

                                  AVIS
                        (smiling warmly)
              Good thing in hindsight.

      Paul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it.  Lots of bills,
      most marked past due.  He finds a "pre- approved" credit card application, sets
      it to one side.

                                  AVIS (cont'd)
              So where was he all these years?

                                  PAUL
              Lower 48.  Said he wanted to get away from the cold.

                                  AVIS
              Where 'bouts?

                                  PAUL
                        (looking up)
              Sorry, what was that?

                                  AVIS
              Where was he living?

      Paul, a flash of panic, looks over at the Hawaii display.  He keys on the shell.

                                  PAUL
              Florida.

                                  AVIS
              I've got an aunt down there.  Where 'bouts?

                                  PAUL
                        (blanking)
              A uh... small place.  By the beach.

                                  AVIS
              Well that's great.  You and Mrs. Barnell will have
              some company for a bit I guess.  How is she?

                                  PAUL
              Better, a little better.  Some days are better than
              others.

23    INT. BARNELL HOME - DAY                                                       23

      MARGARET BARNELL (early 40s) stands in a plush bathrobe and slippers.
      Despite her casual attire she is immaculately made up as she walks to the
      front door, opening it on -- a young wholesome PAPERBOY smiling through the
      cold.

                                  PAPERBOY
              Collecting, Mrs. Barnell.

                                  MARGARET
              Daniel, you pussy little cocksucker.  I'll get my purse.

      The paperboy, unfazed, smiles as Margaret walks off.

                                  PAPERBOY
              It's 12 dollars.  I missed you last time.

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Jerk off... OK, jerk off, uhhuh...

      Margaret gives the paperboy his money, the stamp card plus a dollar tip, then
      tweaks his nose.  Twice.

                                  MARGARET (cont'd)
              You say hi to your slut Mom for me?

                                  PAPERBOY
              Sure will.  Thanks.

      He trots down the walk as Margaret shuts the door.

24    EXT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                          24

      The lid opens.  GARY and JIMBO (30s), check to insure they're not being
      watched.  Gary, slightly effeminate, leans into the bin and BURROWS through
      the garbage.  Jimbo, a bear of man, keeps watch.  He's nervous, a little out of
      sorts.

                                  GARY
              I thought stuff didn't smell when it was frozen?  I
              don't know why we have to--

                                  JIMBO
              Dave wants visual confirmation, he gets visual
              confirmation.  We have a chance to move up here,
              so let's just--

                                  GARY
              Like the guy's not gonna end up in a land- fill,
              anyway.  You ever ask Dave what he did?

                                  JIMBO
              Whatever it was, he told him if he did it again, he'd
              snap his neck.

                                  GARY
                        (smiling)
              Whoops, he did it again.
                        (off Jimbo not getting it)
              The song?  From that girl?

      No response.  Gary, HUMMING now, keeps digging, finding nothing.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              So how'd it feel?  I mean, not when you did it, but,
              like now?

                                  JIMBO
              I don't want to talk about it.

      Gary hops inside as his actions become more frantic.  Still no luck.  He stands.

                                  GARY
              Not here.

      Jimbo glares at his partner.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Serious.  He's gone.  Maybe he wasn't...

                                  JIMBO
              Don't even joke.  Maybe the trash was emptied.

                                  GARY
              Looks pretty full.  Hey...
                        (ducking down)
              There's a little fridge down here.
                        (standing)
              If we would have shot him at least we'd know for
              sure.

                                  JIMBO
              I was following orders.  And if you hadn't started a
              screaming match, no one would have called the
              cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his --

                                  GARY
              Fine.  Sorry.

                                  JIMBO
              Fine.

                                  GARY
              I'm just saying... maybe you didn't break it all the way.

                                  JIMBO
                        (walking away)
              It was broken.

                                  GARY
              I'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and
              he just looked dead.

                                  JIMBO
              It - was - BROKEN!

      Gary, embarrassed, digs in the trash with his feet.

25    INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                                      25 

      Margaret, still in her bathrobe, walks to the fridge.  As she puts her hand on the
      latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor.

      She tugs on the door.  It opens just a crack before the chain stops it.  The
      frozen head peeks through the slight gap.

      Margaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way.
      She gives the door a hip check.  The door latches shut while something frozen
      and brittle inside CRACKS.  Margaret, oblivious, walks away.

26    INT. KITCHEN OVEN                                                             26

      A chicken sits in a pan, the rest of the room visible behind it through the oven
      door window.

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Paul?  Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut?

                                  PAUL
              How's my Angel tonight?

                                  MARGARET
              Blow me.  Dinner's almost ready.  You feel like some
              wine?  I feel like some wine.

      Paul walks to the oven, opens the door and pats the chicken.  Stone cold.

                                  PAUL
              Sweetie, here's a crazy thought... I don't feel like
              chicken tonight, why don't we order in?

                                  MARGARET
              Fuck it, okay.

                                  PAUL
              There's actually something we need to talk about.
              It's about Raymond.  He's back.

      Paul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door.  Behind the chicken, Margaret
      doesn't look happy as Paul starts to explain.  She rushes from the room.

27/28 TIGHT ON: TV SCREEN                                                        27/28

      Home video of RAYMOND (then early 30s), fat, physically imposing and the only
      person not in festive tropical gear, standing in a VFW hall decorated in a
      Caribbean theme. (He is definitely not the same person Paul has cooling in the
      fridge.)  A large banner behind him proclaims "HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY -
      BON VOYAGE."

                                  RAYMOND
                        (a little drunk)
              Okay, I never thought it would last this long, but
              seeing as how it has... There ya go.  Let me just say
              that my brother, old "Puddles McBarnesy" did better
              than he should have.

      A younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his
      brother and smiles.

                                  PAUL
              What'cha saying there Raymond?  Wha'cha saying
              'bout me?

      Raymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder.

                                  RAYMOND
              Enough, OK?

                                  PAUL
                        (sing-songy)
              Ray's a little jeallllllllous.  This is the one that got
              away, right Ray?

      The crowd LAUGHS as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair.
      Raymond, furious, grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to
      the floor.  The laughter stops.

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Leave him alone, ball licker!

                                  RAYMOND
              And shut that thing --

      The screen turns to snow.  We are...

      Paul at his desk, watching the video on a small TV in the wall unit.  He turns his
      attention to a large cardboard box filled with documents, souvenirs, old report
      cards...

      On the TV playing behind him (the second part of the tape), Margaret is pictured
      on a cruise ship, sunning herself.  Paul, obviously behind the camera, watches
      as Margaret takes a tropical drink from a WAITER'S tray, who promptly dumps it
      all over her.  But instead of the expected burst of profanity, Margaret just
      LAUGHS.

                                  MARGARET
              That's okay, don't worry about it.
                        (as the waiter walks off)
              I'd like the next one in a cup, please.

      Paul puts aside a faded hotel postcard from Hawaii and digs out an insurance
      policy out of the box.  On the last page is a list of the payouts.  Loss of a limb:
      $100,000.  Loss of thumb: $5,000. Accidental death: $1,000,000.

      And, as an extra bonus, Raymond's birth certificate.  Perfect. Paul takes out the
      credit card application from work, and starts to write...

                                  PAUL
                        (to himself)
              Raymond... Barnell.

29    EXT. TOBOGGANING HILL - LATE AFTERNOON                                        29

      LAUGHING children on toboggans, inner tubes and discarded cardboard
      boxes slide down a snow covered hill against a slate gray sky.  It's an isolated
      area on the outskirts of the city.

30    INT. GARY AND JIMBO'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                        30

      Gary and Jimbo sit in their car in the parking area.

                                  JIMBO
              Which one's your sister's kid?

                                  GARY
              See the one on the little bike-thing?  Him.

                                  JIMBO
                        (hesitant)
              You been alright with this?

                                  GARY
              The thing with the guy?  Ya know, I thought it might
              kinda mess me up...

                                  JIMBO
              First time for both of us.

                                  GARY
              ...but I've been sleeping really well.

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah.  'Course, you didn't actually...

      Jimbo mimics snapping someone's neck.  It's clearly not a gesture he enjoys.
      As Gary looks at him, a Cadillac pulls up beside them.  Behind the wheel is
      DAVE (50s) well dressed, in a thuggish kinda way.  Jimbo and Gary share a
      nervous look.

31    EXT. TOP OF THE HILL - CONTINUOUS                                             31

      About 50 yards away from the two cars, Gary's NEPHEW is having his
      Snowrider (a tricycle with skis instead of wheels) hijacked by a playground
      BULLY in a red parka.  A tug o' war for the toy ensues as Gary and Jimbo get
      out of their car.

                                  NEPHEW
              Leggo... it's mine.  Uncle Gary!

32    EXT. PARKING AREA                                                             32

      Gary and Jimbo are leaning close to the Cadillac's open window. Dave does
      not look happy.

                                  DAVE
                        (to Jimbo)
              Wait a minute.  He's disappeared?

      Gary waves to his nephew.

                                  GARY
                        (shouting)
              You just... hang in there, Billy!

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah.  But he's dead.  I mean, that part, no question.

                                  DAVE
              Yeah?  Take off your coat.  And your shirt, too.


      Jimbo knows better than to argue.  He strips down, exposing his corpulent
      middle-aged belly to the chilly winter winds.

                                  JIMBO
              I'm not wearing a wire, Dave, if that's what this is
              about.

                                  GARY
              It was our first time.  No one gets it perfect their first
              time.

                                  DAVE
              You too, Sweetie.

      Gary is about to comply when the sound of a FIGHT on the tobogganing hill
      causes them all to look over, just in time to see GARY'S NEPHEW shoved to
      ground.  The Bully LAUGHS as he slides away.

                                  GARY
              Excuse me for a second.

      Gary trots toward the hill.  Jimbo can't believe it.

                                  JIMBO
              Gary!  We're in the middle of something.

                                  GARY
                        (calling back)
              Hey, I'm supposed to be looking after him.

      Jimbo turns back to Dave, shrugging sheepishly.

                                  DAVE
              Is he...?

                                  JIMBO
              He's fine.  Look, we can take you there right now.
              We'll show you.

      Behind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the
      Bully.  He is failing.

                                  DAVE
              Show me what?  An empty trash dumpster?  It was
              supposed to look like an accident.  I was hoping to
              see it in the paper.  So help me, if this guy pops up
              somewhere...

      While Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only
      watch as the Bully slides away.

                                  BULLY
                        (echoing in the cold)
              Fag!  Big homo!

                                  JIMBO
              He won't.  He can't.  He's --

                                  DAVE
              Proof, Jimbo.  I like to know my money's well spent.
              You got a week.

      Dave drives off as Gary walks over with his SNIFFLING nephew.

                                  GARY
              Slippery little sucker.  You mind if we stop at a toy
              store on the way back?

A 33  INT. BARNELL HOME / BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         A 33

      HIGH ANGLE ON:  Paul and Margaret in bed.  Margaret takes up more than her
      share of the bed, her arm tossed over her husband.  Paul, on his third of the
      bed, looks as if he's lying in state. But Paul's not sleeping.

34    EXT.  BARNELL HOME - MORNING                                                  34

      A newspaper clears the "For Sale - price reduced!" sign on the front lawn and
      lands with a THUD on the steps.

      Paul has the "Morning News" on the hood of his car.  He looks over at the
      fridge, still padlocked.

                                  PAUL
                        (to himself)
              Let's see if anyone's missing you.

      He flips through each section.  There's nothing.  Paul walks to the fridge.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
                        (to the corpse)
              I don't know what kind of man let's himself just
              freeze to death in the trash, but I was never one to
              preach.  Way I see it, you've probably got family
              somewhere and they'd probably appreciate seeing
              you get a decent funeral, even if it's not really... yours.

      Paul, somewhat befuddled, gently pats the fridge door.

      Margaret pushes the vacuum across the floor, humming to herself.  Paul walks
      by slipping into his coat.  He notices that the vacuum isn't plugged in.  Without
      missing a beat, he walks over and plugs it into the outlet.  The VACUUM
      ROARS TO LIFE.  Margaret doesn't flinch.  Paul heads out the door.

      A ways out in the forest.  Only two houses on this turn-out; a cozy looking lived
      in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home.  A
      car pulls up.

A40   INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                 A40

      Paul adjusts a pillow he has taped to his stomach, then pulls on a blue ski
      mask.

41    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      41

      Paul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk.  He
      fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses.

      MRS. WHERRY (80s), in her bathrobe, looks out the window of the cozy cabin.
      A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka.  The blue parka waves
      back.

42    INT.  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                                  42

      Paul walks in from the garage, pulling off his blue parka.  Margaret enters from
      the living room.  (Paul still has the pillow taped to his front, which Margaret
      happily pokes with a finger but never mentions.)

                                  MARGARET
                        (nervous)
              He's not here, is he?

                                  PAUL
              Sweetie, don't you worry about Raymond.

                                  MARGARET
              When he's around, it just brings back... Fuck.

                                  PAUL
              I know.  He, he said he's probably gonna head back
              down South soon.

      Margaret smiles, relieved.  The phone RINGS.  Paul picks up.

43    INT. MRS. WHERRY'S HOME - CONTINUOUS                                          43

      Mrs. Wherry talks on the phone in her kitchen.  The head of a large antelope is
      mounted on the wall behind her.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              Paul?  Thank you so much for clearing the drive way.
              That was most considerate.

                                  PAUL
              I'm afraid I don't understand Mrs. Wherry.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              You were out at the cabin this morning.  Nice to see
              you getting some use out of that thing.

      Paul shakes off his boots.

                                  PAUL
              Oh I see.  No, you see that must have been
              Raymond.  (beat) Very much so.  No, no one was
              more surprised than we were. (beat)  No, he's...
              indisposed right now, but I'm sure you'll see him
              again.  He's going to stay at the cabin for a while
              until he... leaves.  And bless you too.

      A "Moose Xing" sign is briefly illuminated by Paul's car's headlights as it heads
      up a snow packed mountain road.  The distant lights of the city are swallowed
      by the thick forests of fir trees that line the road.

48    INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  48

      Paul, nervous, sings along to "Escape" on the radio.

                                  PAUL
              "...It was my own lovely lady, and she said, oh it's

A48   EXT. WILDERNESS ROAD / TURNOUT - NIGHT                                       A48

      Paul pulls off.  Kills his headlights.  Pops the trunk.

      The corpse, now in Raymond's clothing and the blue parka, lies face up on the
      Aloha Airlines promotional surfboard being lurched forward by Paul, who wears
      a pair of snowshoes.  On the body's chest lies a second pair of snowshoes.
      Somewhere, a WOLF HOWLS.

50    EXT. TOP/BOTTOM OF A RIDGE - LATER                                            50

      Paul at the top of a 25 foot drop.  He rolls the corpse, now wearing the other set
      of snowshoes, over the side.  It BOUNCES down, landing in the snow with a
      soft WHUMPH!

      Paul sits in a seeming stupor at the kitchen table.  A DING from the microwave
      snaps him out of his catatonic state.  He walks to the appliance, takes out his
      now re-heated coffee, checks his watch and heads out.

53    EXT. TOP OF THE RIDGE / FOREST - MORNING                                      53

      Paul, wearing snowshoes and carrying the surfboard, peeks over the edge.

      PAUL'S POV: down at the corpse, exactly as it was last night.

                                  PAUL
              Well come on!  How much easier do I have to make
              this?

      His words echo in the cold wilderness.

54    INT.  PAUL'S KITCHEN  - DAY                                                   54

      Jodie the dog is in a complete frenzy, jumping up and down at the feet of Paul
      who stands over a SIZZLING frying pan full of bacon.  He checks the bacon's
      consistency with a fork.  Still pretty raw.  He takes the bacon and lays it on a
      plate.

      Beside the pan on the counter sit a baseball cap and a stapler.  Paul carefully
      takes each strip of bacon and staples it to the peak of the ball cap.  He holds it
      up.  The bacon hangs down like fringe.

      Margaret appears in the doorway.

                                  MARGARET
              Paul?

                                  PAUL
                        (startled)
              Holy-- Margaret, you scared the wits out of me.

      Margaret lifts up Jodie, who's desperately trying to get at the hat.

                                  MARGARET
              She just wants that bacon.

                                  PAUL
              Such a little puppy.  How late is "Rudys" open?

55    EXT. SHOPPING CENTER / RUDYS MARKET  - LATE AFTERNOON                         55

      A large sign outside advertises "Fresh Moose Meat". Paul runs out with a
      shopping bag, jumps in his car and drives off.

56    EXT. BOTTOM OF THE RIDGE - SUNSET                                             56

      Paul, carrying the shopping bag, he painfully picks his way down the rock face
      toward the corpse.

                                  PAUL
                        (really bad British accent)
              You may want to take a gander.  You may want to
              take a gander...

                                                                               CUT TO:

      THE BACON HAT -- as Paul pulls it snug on the corpse's head.  He pulls the
      bloody steaks from the shopping bag and starts to smear them on the corpse's
      parka.  Drops of blood hit the snow at the body's feet and disappear.

      Paul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other
      hanging from a pocket. He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of
      lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face.

                                  PAUL
              Sorry about this part.

      Paul pats the body on the shoulder, then looks up at the ridge and the long
      journey ahead.

58    EXT. BOTTOM OF RIDGE  - NIGHT                                                 58

      A WOLF appears in the moonlight.  Followed by another, and another.  They
      approach the corpse...

59    EXT. HIGHWAY TURNOUT / CLEARING - DAY                                         59

      Snowmobiles SCREAM to the site as people tramp through the thick snow,
      covering all of Paul's hard work.  An ambulance and State Conservation
      vehicles pack the area where Paul first pulled off.  Yellow police tape is strung
      between fir trees marking a path toward the ridge.

60    EXT. BOTTOM OF RIDGE  - DAY                                                   60

      The corpse is covered with a tarp.  The area is littered with blood, animal tracks
      and bits of blue parka.  POLICE OFFICERS and tough looking LOCAL
      SNOWMOBILERS mill about the corpse, taking turns lifting the tarp that covers
      the body.  A few yards away, DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s) talks to a seemingly
      distraught Paul.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
                        (looking at the ridge)
              If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while
              conscious.  Did he say where he'd been living,
              before he came home?

                                  PAUL
              Florida.  He didn't really talk about it much.  He
              brought us this shell.

      Paul holds up a sea shell, obviously from the display at his office.  Tears well
      up in his eyes.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              It's really all we have left.  He'd been gone for five
              years.  We'd given him up--

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              --for dead, yes sir.

                                  PAUL
              How did you...?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy.
                        (Paul shows no reaction)
              Said he saw what looked like a body.  We tracked
              you through his ID.

                                  PAUL
              Just like on TV.

      Boyle nods sympathetically

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              I've got to see him.  Please.

      Paul starts to make his way to the body.  Boyle stops him.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Mr. Barnell,  I should warn you, an animal  attack isn't
              pretty.  There's not much left.

      Paul nods.  They make their way over to the tarp.  Boyle pulls it back.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
              Is that your brother, sir?

      Paul leans in-- the man's face is hamburger.  Paul nods.

                                  PAUL
              They chewed his ears off.  What kind of animal does
              something like that?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Normally I'd say bear, but these tracks and the
              feeding pattern indicate wolf.  It's rare, but it can
              happen.

      Boyle pulls the cover back over the body. Boyle hands Barnell a clear baggie
      with the dead man's wallet inside.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd)
              Your brother's personal effects.  We've got some
              people with the victim's assistance program who
              can help you through this.  Marcie?

      Marcie, a female police officer, walks a distraught Paul away.  As they go,
      another FEMALE COP approaches.

                                  FEMALE COP
              Coroner found some smaller bite marks on the
              ankle.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Pups.  Must have been the whole freakin' pack.

                                  FEMALE COP
              You want an autopsy?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              On what?

                                  FEMALE COP
              Derek found this.

      She holds up a clear evidence bag with the remnants of a strip of bacon on the
      inside.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Not the smartest snack for a hiker.

                                  FEMALE COP
              Messy animals aren't they?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Messy.  Messy messy messy messy.

61    INT. INFLATABLE GOLF DOME - LATE AFTERNOON                                    61

      The second level of a large indoor driving range/mini golf course.  The sound of
      clubs SMACKING golf balls echo as an intense Ted "waggles" before his shot.
      On his back-swing, Tiffany throws her arms around him from behind.

                                  TED
              I take it you're done?

                                  TIFFANY
              Yup.

                                  TED
              Wanna hit some of mine?

                                  TIFFANY
                        (hugging him harder)
              Nope.

      He turns, LAUGHING.  They kiss as she playfully starts to grope him.

                                  TED
              Now this is definitely a violation of Golf Dome policy.

                                  TIFFANY
              Must be all this talk about using your wood.

              Woods.  So maybe later I can... check your grip?

              Secret?

                                  TED
              My dirty talk sucks?

                                  TIFFANY
              I like it when you try, though.

      Tiffany gives him a peck and flits back to a nearby chair.  He hits one, skying it
      into a low hanging light.

                                  TED
              You know in some states they actually do this
              outside?

      Tiffany looks over at one of the tacky tropically-theme'd mini-golf holes.

                                  TIFFANY
              So how many insurance companies are there in the
              United States?  Like, a billion.

                                  TED
              That's not the point, Tiff.  I've busted my ass for
              Liberty Capital.  I don't want to quit.  I deserve to be
              promoted out of this ice bound backwater.

                                  TIFFANY
              And when it happens, I guess I'll just be another
              notch on your briefcase.

                                  TED
              I can't believe you said that.  You know you are...

      He looks around.  Embarrassed, he lowers his voice.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              ...the most important thing in my life.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (smiling/shouting)
              Sorry, what was that!  You want to take me right
              here?

      As other GOLFERS look over, Tiffany and Ted share a warm smile, the moment
      only broken by the ringing of a CELL PHONE.  She SIGHS, unzips Ted's gym
      bag and answers his phone.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Psychic... Uhm, sorry, hello?  Yeah.  Look, is this a
              matter of life and death, because right now he's...

      Suddenly concerned, she hands the phone to Ted.

                                  TED
              Hello? (beat)  You're kidding me.
                        (almost stunned)
              Yeah, I'll hold.

                                  TIFFANY
              Your Mom?

              and pizza triathlon?

                                  TED
              Look, if this is... who I think it is, I may have found us
              a ticket out of here.

                                  TIFFANY
              We don't need a ticket.

      Tiffany stands, knowing it's no use arguing, she pulls on her coat.  Ted tries to
      give her a hug.  She falls into his embrace, but doesn't hug him back.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Don't be late, OK?

      Ted, Cam and Detective Boyle stand at the end near the feet.  A white sheet
      covers most of the deceased.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              That's him.  Raymond Barnell.

                                  TED
              Could you?

      Boyle moves toward the head and pulls back the covering.  Ted recoils.  Cam
      leans in for a closer look.

                                  CAM
              Ouch.  That's gotta hurt.

                                  TED
              So what's your line on this?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Just what it looks like.  Wolves got him. Maybe a
              grizzly with insomnia, but we didn't find any tracks.

                                  TED
              Would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to
              cash in his policy two weeks ago?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell chewed off his
              brother's leg?

                                  TED
              Doesn't that make you the least bit suspicious?

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple ending.  We like
              nice simple endings.

                                  TED
              But shouldn't you--

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but
              I'm guessing it's your job
              to find a way not to pay these poor people.

                                  CAM
              Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down
              whatever leads we can find.

      Ted walks down to the head of the victim, pulls out a camcorder and starts to
      tape the body.

                                  TED
              Detective, we're an insurance company, not the
              Salvation Army.

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Mind telling me what you're doing?

                                  CAM
              They gave every claims team a video camera last
              quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on
              litigation.  We had this case two months ago where
              this mother of six was claiming...

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              I've got my own war stories, thanks.  You mind
              stopping that?

                                  TED
              Just doing --

                                  DETECTIVE BOYLE
              Your job?  Yes, I caught that.

      As Ted gets his last shot, Boyle covers the body back up and slides the drawer
      shut with a loud CLANG.  Black.

63    EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - SUNSET                                                    63

      TV NEWS CAMERA POV: Of Paul, standing on his stoop, as he's interviewed by
      a well made-up female TV REPORTER (20s) dressed for the cold.

                                  TV REPORTER
              You ready Mr. Barnell?

                                  PAUL
              Yes.

      The camera man flicks on his light as Paul squints.

                                  TV REPORTER
              The police told us what happened, how are you folks
              holding up?

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Paul?  Who's out there?

      Paul reaches back, and, as discretely as possible, grabs the door handle to
      keep Margaret from opening it.

                                  PAUL
              Obviously, my wife's very upset...

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Paul, the door's stuck!

      Margaret starts to HAMMER rhythmically on the door.

                                  PAUL
                        (ignoring her)
              It's been a tough, you know, when something like
              this happens you just have to ask yourself...

                                  MARGARET (O.S.)
              Who fucked with the fucking door!

                                  PAUL
              You can see how stressful it's been, I should really
              go now.  We have to plan a service.

      And with that, Paul opens his front door and ducks inside, quickly shutting it
      behind him.

      Branch, very unhappy, flips through some papers then looks up at Ted and
      Cam.

              This isn't a standard case.  You were there when
              this guy came in looking to cash in.  C'mon, it stinks.

                                  BRANCH
              Secondly, if the police say this guy was...

                        (incredulous)
              Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case.  Did you
              see Mr. Barnell on the news last
              night?  Last thing we need is bad P.R.  I don't want
              this thing Valdeez-ing on us.

                                  TED
              Mr. Branch, I'm sure head office would take a rather
              dim view of our --

                                  BRANCH
              Corporate's view will be whatever I tell them.

      Cam, seeing his partner is about to get himself into a heap of trouble, hustles
      him toward the door.

                                  CAM
              Yes Sir.  Color us called off, as of now.

      Gary and Jimbo's car parked in the lot.  Gary is just returning to the vehicle with
      a brown paper bag.  Jimbo has the look of man who hasn't slept in days.

      Gary and Jimbo are eating fish and chips.  The name on the bag is "Ye' Olde

                                  GARY
              Didn't ask.

                                  JIMBO
                        (digging in)
              So we got six different stores here. We got your
              "Great Escapes" travel agency, your Ye Old Fish and
              Chips place, Porn-a-Copia videos, a hair place, one
              for lease and one... what is that?

                                  GARY
              Small engine repair.  See all the snow blowers out
              front.

      There is indeed a row of snowblowers lined up outside.  Jimbo takes another
      bite of his fish.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Should move the blowers over to the triple X store.

      Gary LAUGHS.  Jimbo is in no mood.

                                  JIMBO
              So, which one you figure would want to take our
              friend?

                                  GARY
              I guess maybe the porn palace.  Ya know for some
              weird sex film.

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah, this place is just a hotbed of adult cinema
              production.  Fish shop look clean?

                                  GARY
              Very nice Korean family.  You figure maybe they
              battered him up?

      Gary LAUGHS again, then shoves Jimbo's shoulder.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Maybe we're eatin' him right now.  Huh?

                                  JIMBO
              Gary, this isn't a joke.  You ever known Dave to joke?

      Gary, embarrassed, takes another bite of his fish.  Jimbo turns up the radio.  A
      local call-in show comes on.

                                  WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
              ...it could never happen.  There's never been a
              documented case--

                                  GARY
              Sorry.

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah, "Sorry."  I get strip searched and you go off
              playing snow angels...

                                  RADIO HOST (O.S.)
              Well, we've got one now, don't we!?

                                  WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
              That was different. From what I read in the paper he
              was unconscious. And now people are going to use
              this as an excuse to--

                                  RADIO HOST (O.S.)
              Hey lady, why don't you tell Raymond Barnell how
              wolves have gotten a bad rap.

                                  WOMAN CALLER (O.S.)
              I can tell you from years of experience that wolves do
              not operate--

                                  JIMBO
              Wait a minute.

                                  RADIO HOST (O.S.)
              You can tell me all you want, lady, but it is an
              undeniable, indisputable fact.  This Barnell guy got
              turned into a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild
              animals...

      JIM'S POV: Through the windshield, looking at the sign for "Barnell Great
      Escapes Travel."  Jimbo and Gary look at each other. Maybe...

      Ted at his cubicle on his phone.

                                  TED
              Yeah, hi, it's Ted Watters from Fidelity Mutual. (beat)
              I need a complete credit work up on a Raymond
              Barnell... and Paul, a Paul Barnell too... sure, I'll hold.

      Cam walks by, leans his head over the top of the cubicle.

                                  CAM
              You start the month ends yet?

                                  TED
              Can you take care of it?  I'm kinda... working on
              something.

                                  CAM
              Oh God, you're not still on the Barnell thing are you--

      Ted pulls Cam down into his cubicle, talks in a harsh whisper.

                                  TED
              I went to see him.

                                  CAM
              And?  Then?  So?

                                  TED
              Trust me. Something's not right.  I can smell it.  Help
              me buy a week.

                                  CAM
              We're gonna get in such trouble.

                                  TED
              I promise from now on you can come along on
              everything.

                                  CAM
              No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted
              disappears for three hours?

                                  TED
              I'll try.

                                  CAM
              And you'll work on your interpersonal skills?

                                  TED
                        (a long beat)
              Yes.

                                  CAM
              Good.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go start covering
              your ass.

      Paul sits beside his desk, flipping through travel brochures. Margaret enters,
      teetering in the doorway.  Paul looks up.

                                  PAUL
              Hey.  How's my Princess?

                                  MARGARET
              OK.  I took some Adavan.  And called my psychic.

                                  PAUL
                        (picks up the phone bill)
              Honey, you know how expensive that is.  I thought we
              agreed that...

      She moves to him, runs her hand through his hair.

                                  MARGARET
              Don't be mad.  It's just... this week has been so...
              well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and
              someone trying to steal the fridge.

                                  PAUL
              I know.  Why don't you --

                                  MARGARET
              We got another letter from the HMO today.

                                  PAUL
              Have you opened it yet?

      Margaret starts to CRY, holding the letter up to her face the SOBS building to a
      full blown breakdown.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Oh hey honey, come on now.

                                  MARGARET
              I'm sorry.  It's just, fucking cocksuckers.

      Paul takes the letter, unfolds it and reads...

                                  PAUL
              "As we have stated previously... usual onset before
              the age of 18... coupled with no genetic history..."

                                  MARGARET
              I'm sick!  I'm really, really sick!

                                  PAUL
              Shush, now.  (reading again) "We hasten to add,
              Tourette Syndrome is not..."

                                  MARGARET
              Fuck them.

      Paul is about to say something, but returns to the letter.

                                  PAUL
              "As well, please reference our previous decisions
              regarding your claims for ADD, ODO, OCD,
              ADHOPHI...
                        (treading lightly)
              Honey.  I know you don't like to talk about it, but
              maybe it's not... what we might think it is but... maybe
              it's just stress?  Remember that cruise?  I saw you.
              You were happy.

      Margaret looks at him, crestfallen.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              I'm sorry.  I'm just really tired.

                                  MARGARET
              They say you can't get it all of a sudden but I did.  I
              really, really did.

                                  PAUL
              I know.  They just don't --

                                  MARGARET
              I'll kill myself.  Then they'll see.

                                  PAUL
              That is nonsense talk.

                                  MARGARET
              Then you can go off and...
                        (sobbing again)
              ...marry someone normal.

                                  PAUL
              You're the most normal girl I know.

                                  MARGARET
              I'm not crazy, Paul.  Something's really wrong with
              me.

      He takes her to a small sofa, cradles her in his arms.

                                  PAUL
              I know, Sweetie.  I know.  And we're gonna find you
              the best specialists in...
                        (a second, then confident)
              ...what you have that we can.

                                  MARGARET
              Promise?

                                  PAUL
              I really think things are going to turn around.  Call me
              cr... I just have a feeling.  You just leave everything to
              me, OK?  Is that OK?  Leave everything to me?  I
              promise.

                                  MARGARET
                        (gently)
              Shit bag.

                                  PAUL
              That's my girl.
 
                                                                               CUT TO:

      Where Edward G. Robinson (as the character Keyes in "Double Indemnity")
      grills a man about a fake insurance claim.

                                  EDWARD G. ROBINSON
              "Every time one of these phonies comes along it ties
              knots in my stomach... I can't eat.  That's how I knew
              your claim was crooked..."

      At the sound of DOORBELL, the whole scene freezes.  We are --

      Tiffany at her desk, working on the computer.  Ted has paused the DVD, puts
      down the Barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered PIZZA GUY, soggy
      pizza box in hand.

                                  TED
              Hey.

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Hi there.  That'll be $12.97.

      Ted looks at his watch.

                                  TED
              What about thirty minutes or free?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Doesn't apply when it's snowing.

                                  TED
                        (digging out his wallet)
              So nine months of the year your guarantee is
              worthless?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              It doesn't snow every day.

                                  TED
              They should really tell people when they order.

                                  TIFFANY
              Would you just give him the money already?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              It's not my decision.

                                  TED
              I know that.  I'm just saying.

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Sure.

                                  TED
              You understand though?

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Absolutely.

                                  TED
              It wouldn't take much.

                                  PIZZA GUY
              Full disclosure to the pizza consumer. I'll be sure to
              pass that along.

      The delivery guy leaves.

      Ted walks back into the living room.  Tiffany comes over, grabs a slice.

                                  TIFFANY
              Why you gotta argue with the service industry?

                                  TED
              The problem with people today is they don't expect
              anyone to tell the truth.
              We've just come to accept lying as acceptable.

                                  TIFFANY
              If this is another passive/aggressive shot at Psychic
              Buddies, all our ads state "for amusement purposes
              only."

                                  TED
              Tiff, it has nothing to do with... look, just forget it.

                                  TIFFANY
              You remember being amused, don't ya, honey?
              What is with you anyway?

                                  TED
              Want to know what's "with" me?  I'm on the verge of
              cracking the biggest case of my career, one that
              corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap.
              Not my boss, and not even my girlfriend.

                                  TIFFANY
              So this is my fault?

                                  TED
              No, it's not your fault. I just want to live somewhere
              where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza
              doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled.

      Tiffany storms off as Ted flops onto the couch, swipes the snow from the top of
      the pizza box and hits play on the DVD.

                                  EDWARD G. ROBINSON
              "What kind of outfit is this, anyway?  Are we an
              insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted
              amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that?"

      Tiffany turns from the bedroom door, almost in tears.

                                  TIFFANY
              You know, even though Edward G. Robinson wins,
              everyone like Fred MacMurray better.

      She SLAMS the door.  Ted doesn't move, lost in his own world.

72    INT. MRS. WHERRY'S HOUSE / LIVING ROOM - DAY                                  72

      Ted and Mrs. Wherry sit on plastic covered furniture.  The mounted heads of
      several dozen dead animals, foxes, wolves, elk, surround them.  Ted takes
      notes.

              It was terrible.  Just terrible. Raymond should have
              known better.

              I'm fine.  Did you talk to Raymond at all when he
              came home?  Was he getting along with his
              brother?

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              No.  Only saw him the once.  Never spoke.  Waved to
              him.

                                  TED

              He was clearing my driveway.  Raymond was a real
              hellcat when he was younger.  But like they say, time
              mellows even the hardest soul.

              Sorry.  Did Raymond like the outdoors.  Not so
              much, no.  Liked living out here at the cabin, though.
              I think he had some friends on the police force.
              Have you talked to them?  They'd pull up here day
              and night, always looking for --

              Turns out our Mr. Barnell is mortgaged to the nuts.
              His business is about one step
              away from chapter 11.  Plus it's like his brother
              Raymond never existed.  He's got no credit history,
              no nothing for the last five years.

              Ya know, not having a credit history isn't actually a

              Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace.  Plus, the
              only thing he did after his recent "reappearance" was
              get some new ID and a new credit card.  Didn't
              charge anything.

74    EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY (FULL ON BLIZZARD)                                       74

      Tombstones, barely visible through the blowing snow, dot the top of a small hill
      on the outskirts of town.  A small group of mourners try to keep warm.  Paul and
      Margaret, Avis, two other FRIENDS and the MINISTER huddle against the cold.

                                  MINISTER
              When someone is taken from us at such a young
              age we often ask ourselves, why?  What possible
              purpose could this serve?

      The Minister is temporarily lost from view.

                                  MINISTER (cont'd)
                        (just a voice in the white)
              Why is God, who is a loving God, capable of such
              things...

      The snow clears.  Paul, a pillar of strength, discreetly checks his watch then
      sneaks a concerned look at Margaret who busily grins at everyone in sight.
      Ted's car pulls into the parking area.

75    INT. JIMBO'S CAR / GRAVEYARD PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS                         75

      Gary and Jimbo sit in their vehicle, watching as Ted gets out of his car and is
      swallowed in a white out.  He reappears a moment later farther up the hill.

                                  GARY
              We should have checked the funeral
              announcements right away.

      A wind GUST rocks the casket just as it's lowered into the frozen earth.  The
      funeral breaks up quickly as Paul and his wife shake hands with the minister.

                                  PAUL
              That was lovely, thank you so much.

                                  MINISTER
              Margaret, Paul, you two get some sleep.

      Paul looks nervously at Margaret, who is about to reply.  As her mouth
      engages, a gust of wind obliterates most of her words, except for...

                                  MARGARET
              ...nun banger.

      The Minister smiles, he must have misunderstood.

                                  MINISTER
              Absolutely.

      Paul turns to see Ted approaching.  A blast of snow obscures his view.  When
      Ted reappears, he's just a few steps away.

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  There was no hurry on this, we could
              wait until--

                                  PAUL
              It's OK.  We just wrapped up.  This is my wife,
              Margaret.

      As they shake hands, and Margaret opens her mouth to speak...

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Why don't you wait in the car, sweetheart?

                                  MARGARET
              Okee dokee, smokee.

      Margaret smiles and totters off.

                                  PAUL
              She's under a little strain right now.

      Ted looks down the hill at a small group of TV news vans, the REPORTERS
      just now venturing out into the cold.

                                  TED
              I see the media's here.  They don't give people a
              moment's peace, do they?

              I called them.

              Really?

              Well, they've been asking me to talk some more
              about Raymond.  I thought now might be an
              appropriate time.

                                  TED
              And you'll just happen to mention your heartless
              insurance company that hasn't paid off your policy
              yet.

                                  PAUL
              I had to borrow money for the casket, Mr. Ted.

                                  TED
              You are breaking my heart.

                                  PAUL
              No, I doubt that.  They asked me to bring some
              photos of Raymond.  Guess it's gonna be a pretty
              big story.

      He pulls out some shots of his brother.  They whip around in the wind and
      blowing snow.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Of course, we could walk over there together.  You
              could tell them how deeply moved you were by this
              tragedy and how... the check is on its way?

      Ted thinks, grudgingly impressed with Paul's ploy.

                                  TED
              Enjoy your press conference, Mr. Barnell.

      Paul stuffs the photos back in his pocket and walks down the hill.  Ted watches
      him go, is about to leave when a gust of wind forces him to avert his eyes.
      Looking down he sees a photo of Raymond Barnell, on the beach in swim
      trunks.  Must have fallen.  Ted pockets it and moves on.

      Margaret washes down some pills with her morning coffee as she looks at a
      fawn in the backyard, nibbling on a bush.

                                  MARGARET
              Hey little, Bambi.  Where's your Mommy?  Gettin' it
              from some ten point buck.  Yes she is.  Yes she is.

      Just then, a THUMPING sound from the garage causes the fawn to bolt.
      Margaret turns, suspicious.  She picks up the portable phone as she moves
      toward the door.

      Gary sticks his head inside the now unchained fridge, grabs a can of soda
      from the door rack and closes the door.  A moment later, he reopens the door...

      There, hanging off the frosty inside, is a chunk of the dead man's hair and
      scalp.  Gary pulls it off, not sure what it means, but sure it means something.

      Unseen behind him, Margaret steps into the garage.  She quickly assesses
      the situation.

                                  MARGARET
              Stay away from our fucking appliances.

      Gary spins, shocked to see Margaret.

                                  GARY
              Lady, just calm down.

      Margaret, eyes wide with fear, unleashes a hailstorm of soda cans,
      knickknacks, gardening implements and anything else she can lay her hands
      on.

                                  GARY (cont'd)

      He tries to close in on her, but the torrent of stuff (a rake, a Whipper-Snipper,
      an old pair of skates...) keeps him pinned down.  Finally, he manages to grab his
      gun from his pocket.  But even as he raises it...

      A Bissel Handvac catches him flush in the face.

              Sud of a bit!

      He drops to his knees, grabbing his nose, which is now gushing blood.
      Margaret reaches for her portable phone and starts punching numbers.

                                  MARGARET
              You are in so much trouble.

      Gary stands, pissed off, gun aimed at Margaret's head.

      Gary ducks as the phone whizzes over his head and smashes against the
      garage wall.  He stares at her.  Game over.

              Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof.
              Now I know you guys are gonna bust my --

                                  TED
              Fax over your estimate.  We'll have you a check by
              Friday.

                        (taking Ted aside)
              Ted.  Maybe we should take a look at their inventory
              list first?

                                  TED
              This is a simple case, Cam.  Bad guys, through roof,
              stole stuff.  Let's clear it and get going.

                                  SPELLMAN
              I should tell you... we also had some VCRs we were
              holding for another company.  That could run
              another couple of...

                                  TED
              Cam?  You wanna wrap this up?
                        (off his look)
              Gotta go primary some time.

      Cam shrugs-- "sure."  Ted hands him his clipboard and walks out, the door
      closes behind him with a loud BANG.

                                  CAM
              Mr. Spellman?  Now I noticed a nice looking
              computer in your office.  Why do you think they left
              that?

81    INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER                                       81

      Margaret sits taped to a Lazy-Boy recliner.  Gary, who's still bleeding from the
      nose, sits across from her.

                                  MARGARET
              You try and rape me, I swear to Christ I'll bite it off.

      Gary looks confused.  The doorbell CHIMES, playing "Tiny Bubbles."  (We stay
      in the living room as Gary answers it.)

                                  JIMBO (O.S.)
              What's going on?

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind.

      They both enter the room.  Jimbo looks at Gary, is about to smack him when...

                                  MARGARET
              So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both
              ends?

      Gary and Jimbo have no idea how to react.  Margaret senses their discomfort,
      starts to relax.

                                  GARY
              I just came to look around, but she started yelling
              and hitting me...

                                  MARGARET
              Oh please.

                                  JIMBO
              How the hell is this solving our problem?  How is
              this stepping up?

                                  GARY
              Just listen, okay.

                                  MARGARET
              Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck hasn't stopped
              up your ears.

      Jimbo looks confused.  Gary ushers him into the other room.

82    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - LATER                                           82

      Gary and Jimbo sit at the table, talking.  Jimbo's not happy.

                                  JIMBO
              This is not what we do.

                                  GARY
              It is now.

                                  JIMBO
              Where would we stash her?  Your place?

                                  GARY
              Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out
              without anyone seeing.  And I've seen that sty you
              call an apartment.

                                  JIMBO
              See, it's just a bad idea.

                                  GARY
              Yeah.  Maybe.
                        (a possible idea)
              You see the whirlpool tub?

                                  JIMBO
              You can't be serious.

                                  GARY
              It could be like a little getaway.

      Off Jimbo, considering this.

83    EXT. BARNELL HOME - NIGHT                                                     83

      Paul pulls up, hits the garage door opener and drives in.

84    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN                                                   84

      Paul walks in from the garage, pulls off his jacket.

                                  PAUL
              Hey Maggie-magster.  How ya --

      Paul stops short as he sees Margaret, Gary and Jimbo sitting around the table.
      Margaret's mouth is taped shut.

      Paul is about to lunge at the men when Gary slides his gun into view.  He
      stops.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              What are you people doing in my house?

                                  GARY
              Mr. Barnell.  You have something that belongs to us.

                                  PAUL
              I, I don't know what you're talking about.

                                  JIMBO
              Do you remember a dead man you found in the
              dumpster behind your office?

      Paul, shocked, tries to hold it together.

                                  PAUL
              No, I can't say that... I mean that would probably stick
              in my mind a... dead body.

                                  GARY
              Think hard Mr. Barnell.

      He tosses the frozen lock of hair onto the table.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Think hard.

      Paul realizes he's screwed, gestures to the living room.

85    INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER                                       85

      Gary sits on the sofa as Paul paces.

                                  GARY
              I thought it might be some weirdo sex thing, ya
              know?  But you look like a pretty straight arrow.  So
              then I'm thinking, maybe it's a scam.  Maybe
              somehow our friend is worth some money to you.

      Paul face lets Gary know he's dead on.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              So what'd you collect?

                                  PAUL
              We, we had a life insurance policy
              on my brother.  It was for... 100,000 dollars.

                                  GARY
              You know, it's always you quiet guys.  Here's how it's
              going to work.  We stay here with your wife, you go
              get our guy.

                                  PAUL
              Here?

                                  GARY
              We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead.
              Plus you'll have to explain
              how you scammed the insurance people out of their
              hard earned money.  We'll call you in three days.
              Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our
              trouble.  Screw with us, we start mailing your wife
              back to you.

      Gary pauses for dramatic effect.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              Starting with her feet.

      Gary walks in on Jimbo and Margaret, still gagged.

                                  JIMBO
              He gone?

      Gary nods, well pleased with himself.

                                  GARY
              He was scared.  Really scared.

                                  JIMBO
              You used the feet thing, didn't you?

                                  GARY
              No.

87    INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                  87

      Tiffany comes through the door carrying a sack of groceries.

                                  TIFFANY
              Hey, little help here.  I got Pop Tarts.

      She sees the living room wall -- it's covered with charts, diagrams and
      theories.  Ted on the floor, remote control in hand, replaying the shots of the
      body over and over...

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
                        (re: the screen)
              Don't tell me, "Sound of Music"?
                        (no reaction)
              Honey?  You OK?

                                  TED
              Shhhh.  This is the important part.

      Ted rewinds the tape, hits play, rewinds it again as -- Tiffany watches, quietly at
      first, then with growing frustration.  Finally, she walks over and grabs the
      remote control.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              I was watching that.

                                  TIFFANY
              This stops now.  This case is making me and you
              crazy, especially you.

      No response.  Tiffany plops on the sofa and starts leafing through Ted's files.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Ya know, I am trying to be supportive.  Leading
              experts agree that's the number one complaint men
              have about their mates.

                                  TED
              I don't have any complaints about my... you.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (re: the file)
              Dead guy's got a record?  Cool.

                                  TED
              Yeah. He beat the hell out of some guy in bar fight.
              Broke the guy's eye socket.

      Tiffany scans the file, then looks up at the screen.

                                  TIFFANY
              Honey?

                                  TED
              Yeah?

                                  TIFFANY
              I think you should read this again.

      He looks.  She tosses him the file.

      Margaret, still taped to a chair, sits at the kitchen table.  By the stove, Gary is
      cooking, an apron tied like a bath towel around his waist.

                                  MARGARET
              We don't have any money, you know.

                                  GARY
              Lady.  Please.

                                  MARGARET
              If you want Raymond's fucking insurance money...
              we don't have that either.

                                  GARY
              It's none of your business what we want.

      Gary goes back to his cooking.  Then...

                                  GARY (cont'd)
              So how come you talk like you do?  I mean, cursing
              all the time.

                                  MARGARET
              It's a disease.  It's called Tourette Syndrome.  I can't
              control what I say.  Turnip.

                                  GARY
              Really?

                                  MARGARET
              You've taken a handicapped person hostage.  I hope
              you're proud of yourself.

                                  GARY
              I saw this thing on TV where they said people with
              that don't usually curse.

                                  MARGARET
              They must have got it wrong.

                                  GARY
              I don't think so.  It was a movie of the week based on
              real events.  Don't most of Tourette's people twitch
              and stuff?

      Margaret just glares.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
                        (knowingly)
              Oh, I get it.  You got a spice rack?

                                  MARGARET
              Over the sink.  And what's that supposed to mean?

                                  GARY
              Nothing.  Cumin?

                                  MARGARET
              On the left. (beat)  And I'm not... crazy, it's a physical
              disease.  Sometimes I can control it, and
              sometimes --

                                  GARY
              You can't?  Want to know what I think?  I think this
              "syndrome" is something you
              read about somewhere and figured, hey, works for
              me.

                                  MARGARET
              Ass-rimming ball-sucker.

                                  GARY
              You can completely abdicate your societal
              responsibilities, say whatever you want whenever
              you want, and slough it off on a illness.  Maybe I
              should catch this thing. "Gee, sorry Your Honor, I
              have a disease that makes me rob 7-11s."  It's
              called really need a Slurpee disease.

                                  MARGARET
              You've never robbed a 7-11 in your life you shit
              eating fuck-weasel.  What kind of man threatens a
              woman with a gun, anyway?

                                  GARY
              You are so faking it.

                                  MARGARET
              Oh, I'm faking it?  Is this how you get your kicks, you
              over-compensating pussy little fart sack?

      Gary, suddenly tense, puts down his spoon and picks up his gun.

                                  GARY
              Hey!  Keep your voice down or the gag goes back.

                                  MARGARET
              You don't scare me.  If something bad was going to
              happen, my psychic would have told me.

      Gary awkwardly chambers a round, starts gesturing with the gun, trying to look
      tough.

                                  MARGARET (cont'd)
              You put that down now you little bitch, or so help me,
              I'll start yelling so loud you'll have to shoot me.

      Gary, confused and embarrassed, doesn't know what to do.

      Paul gets out of his car carrying a K-Mart bag.  He looks like he's been
      CRYING.  Mrs. Wherry waves from her deck.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              Paul, sorry to hear about your brother.

              Just for a bit.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              She'll come to her senses.  They always do.  Oh, the
              septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the
              outdoor commode.

      Paul waves as he enters the mobile home, closing the door behind him.  A
      light goes on.  It starts to snow.

90    INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                              90

      Paul walks in, survey's the interior of the mobile home.

      PAUL'S POV:  A 7 year old time capsule of a party that was never cleaned up;
      beer bottles, ashtrays and general garbage.

                                  PAUL
                        (to himself)
              Would it have killed you to clean up before you left,
              Raymond?

      Paul picks up a small box from the floor, looks at the label.  Edible Panties.  He
      puts them on top of a stack of porno mags, neatens the pile, then heads out.

      INT. BEDROOM - LATER

      HIGH ANGLE ON: Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position
      we've seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret.  An electric heater glows
      beside him.

91    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - CONTINUOUS                                         91

      TIGHT ON: Car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road.  A pair of heavy
      men's boots get out, start to make their way toward the mobile home.

92    INT. MOBILE HOME - LATE NIGHT                                                 92

      There's a KNOCK on the door.  Paul heads to the door.

                                  PAUL
              Who is it?

                                  MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
              State Police.  Is there a Mr. Barnell here?

                                  PAUL
                        (as he unlocks it)
              Yes, is there something wrong--

      As he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open.  The force of the
      blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall
      where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head.
      RAYMOND BARNELL (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws
      him through the serving kitchen serving hatch.  Raymond leans through the
      hole.

                                  RAYMOND
              Hello brother.

      He walks around, takes a copy of "USA Today" and throws it at Paul.

                                  PAUL
              Raymond?  Is that...

                                  RAYMOND
              Page 16, Paul. That's why I love "USA Today", news
              from every fuckin' state.  Don't you want to read it?  I
              was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.  But ya know,
              despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper.

      Paul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond
      right on his heels.

                                  PAUL
              Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.  We
              all thought you were...

                                  RAYMOND
              Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression.

                                  PAUL
              But you had dropped off the face of the earth.

                                  RAYMOND
              And you just decide to make it permanent?

                                  PAUL
              But there were no records of you anywhere.  I
              checked.

      With that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs.  Paul doubles over,
      gasping for breath.

                                  RAYMOND
              In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using
              your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the
              reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth
              certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was
              pretty pissed.

      Raymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging
      him to stop.  Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a
      sitting position.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              But then I start to think, Paul's no idiot.  He woulda
              told 'em it's not me.  Unless...

      Paul can only sit there and WHEEZE.  Raymond sits beside him on the floor,
      pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              So what is it?  Frame job, lawsuit...

                                  PAUL
              Life insurance.

                                  RAYMOND
              Figured.  So where's my money?

                                  PAUL
              Your money?
                        (a beat)
              They're still... investigating.

                                  RAYMOND
              What you get?

      Paul considers whether or not Raymond would even remember.

                                  PAUL
              Fifty thousand.

                                  RAYMOND
                        (with a shrug)
              Almost worth coming back for.  What's the split?  I
              get half?

                                  PAUL
                        (not quite trusting him)
              Okay.  Sure.
                        (changing the subject)
              You look good.  Lost some weight?

                                  RAYMOND
              Gave up carbs.  So what are you doing out here?
              She not go along with it?

                                  PAUL
              Who?  Margaret?

                                  RAYMOND
              How she hold up, anyway?

                                  PAUL
              She's fine.  Actually, we're not doing so good right
              now.

                                  RAYMOND
              Any kids?
                        (off his look)
              Still can't get one by the goalie, huh.

93    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - LATER                                           93

      Gary and Margaret sit in silence, Gary taking Margaret's pulse.  Jimbo walks in,
      grocery bag in hand.

                                  JIMBO
              Hey.

                                  GARY
                        (snarky)
              Hey.

                                  JIMBO
              Talked to our friend.  We're okay for now.  How's
              everything here?

                                  GARY
              Oh, just great.
                        (to Margaret)
              Seventy six, perfectly normal.  What a shock.

      Gary jumps up and storms into the bathroom just off the kitchen.

                                  MARGARET
              He's a little over tired.

                                  JIMBO
              It's been a rough week.

                                  MARGARET
                        (for Gary's benefit)
              Really?  Why?  You and your life partner in the shitter
              having trouble picking a China pattern?

                                  JIMBO
                        (shocked)
              Um, um... Gary?

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              Your turn to deal with it.  If I come out of this
              bathroom I'll put a bullet in her head, swear to God.

                                  MARGARET
              I have a psychiatric disorder.
                        (to Gary, in the bathroom)
              And so do you!

94    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / DRIVEWAY - MORNING                                 94

      Paul, looking like a man who recently took a beating, shovels the light snow
      cover that blankets the drive.  He looks as Ted's car pulls up.  As Ted walks
      toward him...

                                  PAUL
              Mr. Watters.  You said on the phone something
              about a resolution in our claim?

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  Why are you staying out here?

      Paul thinks about this for a long time.  Then, finally...

                                  PAUL
              My wife and I, we're having some problems.

                                  TED
              Kind of understandable I guess.  Seeing as how you
              killed that man and dumped his body out in the
              woods.

                                  PAUL
              You mean Raymond?

                                  TED
              No.  Not Raymond.  Definitely not Raymond.  I
              thought it was at first, but that's what was throwing
              me...

                                  PAUL
              I'm not sure I appreciate your tone.

                                  TED
              My tone, Mr. Barnell?  You are going to jail.  I will
              personally see to that.

                                  PAUL
              I really think you should go now.

                                  TED
              You are a liar and thief.

      Paul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted.

                                  PAUL
              You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night,
              so if you wouldn't mind just leaving.

      Paul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow.  Ted, rolling his
      eyes, reaches down to help him up.

                                  TED
                        (noticing the bruises)
              Hey.  How'd you get all cut up?

                                  MRS. WHERRY (O.S.)
              What's say you just move away from him.

      Ted, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a
      compound bow aimed at his forehead.

                                  MRS. WHERRY (cont'd)
              You all right there, Paul?

                                  PAUL
              I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry.  Just go back inside.

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              I can drop him if you want.

                                  PAUL
              I'm fine.  Really.
                        (turning to Watters)
              I think you'd better go.

      Ted backs to his car, gets in and drives off.  Paul brushes the snow from his
      jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the
      wound).

                                  MRS. WHERRY
              I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that.

      Paul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips.  An idea slowly
      takes hold.

95    INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      95

      Raymond pours whiskey into a 7-11 specialty cup as Paul  pulls off his coat.

                                  RAYMOND
              He give you the check?

                                  PAUL
              No.  He thinks I...  It'll be fine.

                                  RAYMOND
              Maybe I'll pay him a little visit.  See if we can speed
              up the process.

                                  PAUL
              You don't have to... I figured out a way to take care of
              things.

                                  RAYMOND
              Yeah, I was watching from the window.

      Paul, agitated, pulls the blinds shut.

                                  PAUL
              You can't do that, Raymond.  If someone sees you...

                                  RAYMOND
              Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie.

                                  PAUL
              About what?

      Raymond walks over to Paul.  Paul tenses, expecting to be hit.  Raymond
      moves right by to refill his drink.

                                  RAYMOND
              After we get her back from these guys who grabbed
              her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth
              shut?

                                  PAUL
              I don't think I...

                                  RAYMOND
              Crazy people talk a lot.  And I think if you tell your
              therapist something, they can use it in court.

                                  PAUL
              She's not...  she doesn't have a therapist.

                                  RAYMOND
                        (taking a slug)
              Still, might wanna think about it.

                                  PAUL
              Think about what?

                                  RAYMOND
              You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie.  Fraud.
              Consorting with felons.  Got to "cowboy up."

                                  PAUL
              Cowboy up?

                                  RAYMOND
              Get tough, ya suck-hole.  I'm just saying sometimes
              a man has to make problematic decisions.  Cull the
              heard, so to speak.
                        (off his look)
              Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here.  Don't be
              such a fuckin' stick.

      Raymond, an enigma, looks at Paul, then grins -- just kidding.  Paul relaxes.
      Raymond tenses -- not really.  Paul's not sure how to read his brother as they
      shoot looks at one another -- sibling rivalry ad absurdum.

96    EXT. CITY SKYLINE - MORNING                                                   96

      The sky moves from dark grey to light grey, then stops.  A thermometer outside
      on an office tower shows a brisk minus 20.  Workers bundle themselves
      against the cold, hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road.

97    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - MORNING                                               97

      Ted walks in, throwing his coat over the wall of his cubicle and is about to sit
      down when he notices Paul in his boss' office.  Ted moves closer.

                                  PAUL (MUFFLED)
              I haven't called the police yet, but I'll tell you it was
              certainly tempting.

      Ted opens the door to his boss' office.  Paul doesn't notice.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              I've had some dealings with, diseases of the mind,
              and I can tell you he is not well.

      Branch, obviously worried, stands.

                                  BRANCH
              Watters.  Glad you're... Mr. Barnell was just telling
              me about the... meeting you two had.

              I caught that, yes.

                                  BRANCH
              As you can see... well, Mr. Barnell has some...
              concerns.

      Paul turns to look at Ted.  He has a large band-aid on his forehead, scratches
      and bruises on his face.  It takes a second for the dime to drop.

                                  TED
              You don't think I did this?

      Paul gets up and moves to the other side of the office.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Oh come on.  I never laid a hand on him.

                                  BRANCH
              Ted, his neighbor says... otherwise.

                                  TED
              Now just hang on here.  Let me show you
              something...

      Ted digs into his briefcase.  He takes out a video tape, the police file on
      Raymond and the photo of Raymond Paul dropped in the snow.

98/99 INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER                                                98/99

      Paul and Branch listen intently as Ted paces, the TV/VCR plays shots of the
      dead body in the background.

                                  TED
              See?  Where's the birthmark?  Your brother's police
              report listed it...
                        (reading from the report)
              "...large purple birthmark, upper left thigh..."
                        (leaning into the screen)
              But I don't see it.  Not on this body.  You can see it in
              the picture.  See?

      Ted points to the photo;  Raymond, in the summer, wearing shorts with a
      blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              So what, Mr. Barnell?  Did it just disappear?  Did it
              just... get better.

      Ted grins.  His moment.  Finally.  Seconds feel like minutes.

                                  PAUL
              It... did get better.

                                  TED
              Did it now.  Well how in the world did that happen?

                                  PAUL
              Raymond was always... bothered by it. When he
              came back from... Florida, he'd
              had it fixed.  Laser surgery... like removing a tattoo.

      Paul looks at Branch.  It's an excuse Ted hadn't thought of before.

                                  TED
              He did not.

                                  PAUL
              You taped my brother's body, in the morgue?

      Paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              And this?  You stole pictures of my family?  And
              taped his naked body?  What kind of sick company
              are you running here?

                                  TED
              Oh for... he's lying.  It's obvious he...

      Paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              This is crazy.  All we have to do is dig up the body...
              check the leg for scars...
                        (bingo)
              Dental records!

      Paul goes white.  He hadn't thought about this.

                                  BRANCH
              That will be just about enough of that. Mr. Barnell, I'm
              sorry it's all come to this.  We'll have a check brought
              over to you tomorrow morning.

      Paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out.  After a
      moment...

                                  TED
              Sir, with all due respect, he's --

                                  BRANCH
              Jesus, we're lucky he's not suing.  Now tomorrow,
              you deliver the check to Mr. Barnell with a complete
              apology.

                                  TED
              Fine, I understand how this looks --

                                  BRANCH
              It looks like you beat the hell out of one of our policy
              holders.  Now send Cam in here.

                                  TED
              Why?

                                  BRANCH
              Well, while you were off on your little Easter Egg
              hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse
              robbery.  Head office is bumping him a level.

                                  TED
                        (fuck me naked)
              I'll go get him.

                                  BRANCH
              They're very keen on him.  They want me to feel him
              out on a transfer --

      Ted has left the office, SLAMMING the door behind him.

100   INT. INSURANCE OFFICE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER                              100

      The door CLANGS shut behind Paul as he dials his cell phone.

                                  PAUL
              Hello... yes, I'm wondering what city department
              would be in charge of... sure, I can hold.
                        (to himself)
              Hang on Mag Pie, just hang on.

      Paul puts a hand to his chest.  Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts
      to RETCH.  Tears well up in his eyes.  After a few moments, the storm passes.
      Still on his knees, the person on the line comes back.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Yeah, hi.   I was wondering if you could.... but I was...
              sure.

      He sits there, on hold again, waiting...

101   INT. UNDERGROUND PARKING AREA - EVENING                                      101

      Ted walks to his car.  As he opens the door -- WHAM!  A fist to his face drops
      Ted.  Raymond in a ski mask, picks him up, opens the car door and lays Ted's
      head on the door jamb.

                                  RAYMOND
              Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of
              this.  You get me?

      Raymond leans onto the door, Ted SCREAMING as his head is squashed in
      the vice.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              So let's just settle this right now, OK?  We want
              what's coming to us.

      Ted tries to say "yes."  Raymond releases his grip on the door, leans down and
      grabs Ted's wallet and walks off.

      Paul walks in on A LOUD PARTY.  Raymond, drunk out of his head, has his
      arms around two marginal looking HOOKERS.

                                  PAUL
              Ray -

      Not wanting to use his brother's real name.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Richard!  What in the blazes are you doing?

                                  RAYMOND
              Hey Paul.  Took care of our little problem today.  We
              should see some serious money any time, soon.

                                  PAUL
              Could... I have a word with you?

104   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                              104

      Paul pulls the sliding door closed behind Raymond.

                                  PAUL
                        (whisper)
              Are those...?

                                  RAYMOND
                        (serious)
              Prostitutes?
                        (laughing)
              I sure as hell hope so, cause Jehovah's Witnesses
              won't lick your lolly no matter how much you pay
              them.

                                  PAUL
              How did you get them here?

      Raymond pulls out the credit card Paul got for him.

                                  RAYMOND
              Put it on my plastic.  See, got my name on it and
              everything.  It's every where I want to be.

                                  PAUL
              You can't use that.  You're supposed to be dead!
              They'll track us down.

                                  RAYMOND
              You think they give a shit who pays the bill?  Think for
              a minute, will ya?

      Paul turns, trying to compose himself, when he notices  a handgun sitting out
      on the counter.

                                  PAUL
              What... Raymond, what is... this?

      Paul pokes at the gun, sending the barrel spinning around to face him.
      Raymond grabs it and stuffs it into his pants.

                                  RAYMOND
              That's "muh gun," Paul.

      Paul's cell phone RINGS.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Don't be long.  The little spinner's yours.

      Paul picks up the phone as the party revs back up.

                                  PAUL
              Yes, hello.  Sorry, what?

105/106 INTERCUT:  BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                         105/106

      Jimbo is on the wall mounted phone.

                                  JIMBO
              You having a party, Mr. Barnell?
                        (embarrassed for Margaret)
              That's... that's not right.

      Margaret, now gagged, sits where we last saw her.  She tries to talk through
      the gag.

      Gary's staring at his watch, calling out seconds.

                                  GARY
              Thirty, sorry, startinnng... Now!

      Paul pulls the kitchen door closed with his free hand.

                                  PAUL
              There's no party...let me talk to my wife.

                                  JIMBO
              Hang on.

      He hands the phone to Margaret.  Gary leaps up and stops him.

                                  GARY
              Twenty-five!

      Jimbo pushes past him, pulls down Margaret's gag and holds the phone to
      her.

                                  PAUL
              Why are you counting?

                                  MARGARET
              Paul?  Are you entertaining?

                                  PAUL
                        (a wave of relief)
              Oh God, oh Jesus... Margaret, are you okay?

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)
              Paul, we got any more chips?

                                  GARY
              Fifteen!
                        (grabs the phone)
              The body. Have you -- (beat) No, I'm the other guy.
              Have you got the body?

                                  MARGARET
                        (shouting)
              Paul, the carrot little weasly one wants to carrot
              screw me with his sick carrot little cock.  And he's
              messing up my kitchen.  Carrotcarrocarrot...

      Jimbo, annoyed, puts the gag back in Margaret's mouth.

                                  PAUL
              You sick... Don't you hurt her!!

                                  GARY
              I never said anything like--
                        (looks at his watch in panic)
              Yes or no.  Ten seconds.

                                  PAUL
              Yes! It'll... it'll happen tomorrow.  Put Margaret back
              on!

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)
              Paul!  Chips!!

                                  PAUL
              Hello?

      Gary lunges for the phone cradle like it's the finish line in the 100 meter dash,
      slamming the phone down.  A beat.

                                  GARY
              I think I managed to avoid a trace.

                                  JIMBO
                        (quietly to Gary)
              We're staying at his house.

      Paul goes to the cupboard and pulls out a box of potato chips.  As he turns, he
      sees one of the HOOKERS (30s) standing in the doorway.  She gives Paul a
      come hither look.

108   INT. BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL - MORNING                                  108

      A bruised Ted enters, once again the only person in the shop.  He keeps his
      parka on.  Avis stands to greet him.

                                  AVIS
              Hello.  Can I help you?

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
                        (icily)
              Mr. Watters?

      Paul comes around the corner.  He extends his hand, shocked to see the
      bruises on Ted's face but knowing exactly where they came from.

                                  TED
              Mr. Barnell.  I have your check.

                                  PAUL
              Thank you, I appreciate that.
                        (an awkward pause)
              Please, sit.

      Ted sits at Paul desk, reaches into his brief case and pulls out an envelope
      and several forms.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Have a little accident, there?

                                  TED
              I was mugged.  The cops say it was just a random
              act of violence.  But who knows, right?
                        (re: documents)
              You'll have to sign.

      Ted slides the papers across to Paul, then gets up and moves around over
      Paul's shoulder.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              Where I've marked it with an X.  And... I'd also like to
              apologize for my --

                                  PAUL
              No, please.  You don't have to...

      Paul, at a loss, starts to read the paperwork. He pulls open his desk drawer to
      grab a pen.  Ted looks down, sees the Sea Shell in the drawer.

                                  TED
              That's quite the shell.

                                  PAUL
                        (picking it up)
              It was a gift from Raymond.  He bought it for me from
              Florida.  It's all we have to remember him by.

      Paul puts the shell down on the desk.

                                  TED
              That and a million dollars.  Things really worked out
              for you, didn't they? lots of cash, newly single guy...

              Mr. Watters, I love my wife.  Very much.

      Ted can't help but look confused by this simple, yet sincere declaration.

                                  TED
              Can we level with each other for a moment?
                        (Paul nods)
              Did you --

      Before he can finish his question, a DELIVERY DRIVER entering the office with
      a large box.

                                  PAUL
              Avis!  Avis?

      There's no answer.  She's in the back.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Will you excuse me?

      Paul gets up to deal with the delivery.  Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns
      it over in his hands.  Avis enter from the back.  She smiles at Ted, then sees
      the shell.

                                  AVIS
              Oh, that's where you went.

      She takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for Aloha Air.  Ted,
      confused, walks over as Avis snaps the shell back into place.

                                  TED
              That's quite the display.

                                  AVIS
              They do some very nice in store promotions.

      Paul walks back, shocked to see the shell now back on the display.  Ted just
      stares at him.

                                  AVIS (cont'd)
              Here it is Mr. Barnell.
                        (to Ted)
              I thought someone might have walked out with it.  It's
              not the best neighborhood.

      Avis walks back to her desk.  Ted and Paul hold their look.  Finally, Paul walks
      back to his desk and the paperwork.

                                  PAUL
              So, right here, by the X.

      Ted nods.  Paul signs.  Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul
      but doesn't let go.  Paul tries to pull it free.  He looks at Ted who looks right
      through him.  Just then, the lights go out.  They're all in the dark.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              We, uh... Avis?  Call Municipal Light and Power and
              let them know I'll... stop by in a bit.

      Paul looks at Ted, embarrassed.  Ted finally lets go of the check.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Thank you.

      Ted shakes his head, gets up and walks out.

A109  EXT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - NIGHT                                 A109

      Paul, seen through the window, sits alone in the dark.  His face lit only by a
      small flashlight, he is completely still.

110   INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                 110

      Tiffany on her headset with a customer.  Ted on the sofa, lost in thought and
      whatever's on the TV.

                                  TIFFANY
              There's nothing to be embarrassed about.
                        (a snide glance at Ted)
              A lot of people find talking to a psychic very
              therapeutic.  So what's on your mind, Carlos?

111   INTERCUT WITH: "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - CONT.                        111

      An overwrought Paul is on the phone with Tiffany, sitting in the dark.  He's got
      his home phone bill in front of him.

                                  PAUL
              I have a situation.  My wife...  do you think it's okay to
              do something kinda bad to someone if you think
              they're gonna do something really bad to someone
              else?

                                  TIFFANY
              Sure.

                                  PAUL
              What if it's a really bad thing?

                                  TIFFANY
              Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can
              help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this
              other thing?

                                  PAUL
              I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said
              he was joking, but I... I think he might.

                                  TIFFANY
              Don't think, know.  How close are you to the other
              someone else, the one you're trying to protect?

                                  PAUL
                        (crying)
              I just, I just...  Have you ever felt like that?  Like your
              own life didn't even matter, as long as...

                                  TIFFANY
                        (touched)
              Listen to me, Carlos.  Your wife is an incredibly lucky
              woman.  I know, relationships are tough, but you do
              what you gotta do to keep it together, okay?
              Remember, love is sacrifice.

      Ted can't help but SNORT at the mention of this familiar phrase as he looks at
      Tiffany.  Tiffany glares back at him.

                                  PAUL
                        (sniffling)
              I guess you're right.

                                  TIFFANY
              Now you get tough.  And remember, this call is for
              entertainment purposes only.  Call me back and let
              me know how it goes.

      Tiffany hangs up and walks out.  Ted tries to catch her eye and let her know he
      was just kidding.  He can't.  She goes.

112   INT. PAUL'S CAR - LATER                                                      112

      Paul behind the wheel, a strange determined look on his face.  He appears be
      steeling himself for something.

113   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / MAIN AREA - LATER                                 113

      Paul enters, SLAMMING the door behind him as Raymond looks up from his
      porno magazine.

                                  PAUL
                        (blowing by)
              She's having sex with them.

      And with that, Paul disappears into the back bedroom.

114   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / BACK BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER                      114

      Paul sits, waiting.  After what seems like forever, Raymond walks in.

                                  RAYMOND
              Who's doing what?

                                  PAUL
              Margaret.  You know that Stockholm Syndrome
              thing?

                                  RAYMOND
              The movie?

                                  PAUL
              When you fall in love with your kidnappers.

                                  RAYMOND
              Get the fuck out of here.

                                  PAUL
              I went by there.  She was in the bedroom with the big
              one.
                        (quietly)
              Not the first time, either.
                        (a flash of panic)
              With other men, not kidnappers.

                                  RAYMOND
              For real?

                                  PAUL
              Her therapist.  And some guy she... hardly knew.

                                  RAYMOND
              Wow.  Sucks to be you.

                                  PAUL
              Shut up.

      Raymond, a momentary flash of anger, sits on the bed beside his brother.
      Paul does his best not to flinch.

                                  RAYMOND
              I always knew she was a fucking tease.

                                  PAUL
              Yeah.  Guess you were right.

                                  RAYMOND
              Well, you want my opinion...
                        (Paul nods)
              I don't trust her, Paul.  Never did.

                                  PAUL
              You think she'd... really mess things up?

                                  RAYMOND
              Only one way to make sure she doesn't.

                                  PAUL
              Not sure what you're saying?

                                  RAYMOND
              You remember that pooch Mom had?  Crazy little
              Jack Russel with the bladder infection?

                                  PAUL
              Whole basement stank.

                                  RAYMOND
              Nothing you can do but put the thing out of it's
              misery.  And yours.

                                  PAUL
              You... You sure, Ray?

                                  RAYMOND
              Trust me, Bro'.  Leaky dogs, crazy women.  Two
              things no man should have to live with.

      As Ray stands to go, Paul nods, his heart ripped apart for any number of
      reasons.

115   INT. BANK OFFICE - MORNING                                                   115

      Paul sits in the manager's office, signing forms.  A large BANK GUARD stands
      nearby.  The reason? One million dollars in hundred dollar bills neatly stacked
      on the desk.

116   INT. OUTDOOR CLOTHING STORE - DAY                                            116

      Paul, with his sack of one million dollars at his feet, is calmly trying on new
      winter coats with a CLERK.  He feels each one, checking the amount of
      padding.  He finally settles on a red full-length down parka.

117   INT. "BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL" - LATER                                  117

      The lights are back on as Paul, wearing his oversized red parka comes
      through the front door carrying his sack of cash.  Avis looks up.

                                  AVIS
              Mr. Barnell?  I didn't expect you back today.  Nice
              jacket.

                                  PAUL
              Well... I am.  And Avis?

                                  AVIS
              Yes?

                                  PAUL
              You've been with me for five years?  Paul?  Can we
              make it Paul?

      Paul enters the back room, closes the door.  Avis walks over.

                                  AVIS
              Sure.  I just thought it was more professional when
              people were around to call you Mr. Barnell.

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
              Avis.  There haven't been any people in here for
              months.  No one comes in here, unless they're
              looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish,
              neither of which we carry.  So you can call me pretty
              much anything you want and it won't impress the
              customers at all because we don't have any.

                                  AVIS
              Are you OK, Paul?

      Paul opens the door.  Avis is surprised to see billowing clouds of down floating
      in the air behind him.

                                  PAUL
              No Avis, to be frank I'm a little frazzled right now.
              Now could you get me some tape, my passport out
              of the safe and two open-ended tickets to Paraguay.

      Paul shuts the door.  Avis gets to work.

118   INT.  COFFEE ROOM - DAY                                                      118

      ARNITH and BILL, two city workers, sit sipping coffee at a cafeteria table.  The
      room is white, very clean and fairly new.  The men wear large orange overalls,
      their white construction safety helmets sit on the table beside them.

                                  ARNITH
              Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting
              us back.

      Raymond and Paul, wearing his big red parka, enter.

                                  PAUL
              Excuse me, are you Arnith?

      ARNITH sips his coffee, points to his name patch but doesn't look up.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Great.  I was told to give you this.

      Paul hands Arnith a folded form.  Arnith puts his hand out, forcing Paul to move
      the form to him.  As Arnith looks at it.

                                  PAUL (cont'd)
              Disinterment order.  Got it from the coroner's office.
              My brother didn't want to be buried.

                                  ARNITH
              How'd you know?

                                  PAUL
              Know what?

                                  ARNITH
              That he didn't want to be buried.

                                  RAYMOND
              He left it in a letter.

                                  ARNITH
              And you just got it now?

                                  PAUL
              Ya know, I don't mean to be rude here, but I'm not
              sure this is any of your business.

                                  ARNITH
              That's entirely possible.

      Bill stifles a LAUGH.  Raymond is about to tear out Arnith's spine.  Paul holds
      his brother back.

                                  PAUL
              I, I don't think this is anything to be flippant about.

                                  ARNITH
              I appreciate that, Sir.  But I'm on a union specified
              break right now, which means you are talking to me
              as a private citizen. Now as a private citizen I can
              pretty much say whatever I want to. If
               you talk to me in 15 minutes I can assure you, you
              will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the
              workers policy guide and recently ratified in our
              latest collective agreement dated --

                                  PAUL
              Sorry.  I'm just --

                                  ARNITH
              Trying to get your brother out of the ground. We
              couldn't be more pleased.  You've arranged for
              transportation of the remains?

                                  RAYMOND
              We're gonna take him to go.

                                  BILL
              See, now that's a problem.  We can't release the
              body into your custody unless you are licensed by
              the state to convey deceased persons.

                                  ARNITH
              Good point Bill.  Bill knows exhumation policy.  You
              can look it up but I'm betting he's right.  You come
              back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this.

      Paul thinks for a moment, digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp, new hundred
      dollar bills and SLAMS them on the table.

                                  PAUL
              I'll give you five hundred dollars to go get him now.

119   EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY                                                         119

      A large back hoe TURNS OVER.  The muffler BELCHES a cloud of black
      smoke into the air.  Arnith is at the controls, expertly maneuvering the shovel

      Black.  The trunk lid opens as Bill and Arnith dump a well-wrapped body
      unceremoniously into the trunk.  Arnith and Bill look at each other.  Bill closes
      the lid.  Black.

                                  ARNITH (O.S.)
              There ya go Mr. Barnell.  Snug as a bug in a rug.
              Anything else we can get you?

      Ted sits at the bar beside Cam.  Ted, close to being drunk, plays with a book of
      matches as a STRIPPER struts to Tennessee Ernie Ford's version of "16
      Tons."

                                  CAM
              So... Miami, huh?  Can you believe that?  One little
              case and "boom", you're the flavor of the month.

                                  TED
                        (without a trace of sincerity)
              Congratulations.  Why are you here?

                                  CAM
              Say thanks.  I really owe you.  If you hadn't given me
              a shot on that--

                                  TED
              Forget it.  I'm trying to.

                                  CAM
              So we were all kinda wondering... what did happen
              to your face?

                                  TED
                        (beat)
              Car trouble.

      Ted gets up, a little shaky on his feet.

                                  CAM
              Should you be driving?

                                  TED
              Absolutely not.

      Ted gets up and walks to the door.

      Ted exits, a BLAST of Arctic wind and snow hits him in the face.  He closes his
      eyes, letting the cold run over him.

122   INT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                                    122

      Margaret sits at the dinner table, as Gary puts down an overly large serving
      plate of tuna casserole.  Jimbo walks in, takes a seat and a scoop full of food.

                                  GARY
              We set?

                                  JIMBO
              Yeah.  How you feel about the turnout by Summit Hill
              where the snowmobilers park?

                                  GARY
              Fine.

      They all dig in.  Gary looks expectantly.  Just the sound of chewing.  Finally, he
      can't wait.

                                  GARY (cont'd)
                        (to Jimbo)
              You like it?

                                  MARGARET
              Tastes like a rectal polyp.

      A long, protracted silence.  Then...

                                  JIMBO
                        (to Gary)
              How would she know.

      Gary CHUCKLES as he gets up for some ketchup.  Margaret stares at Jimbo,
      who gives her a "I'll-say-what-I-need-to-have-peace-in-this-house."  Margaret
      smiles, then discretely slides him the salt.  Jimbo quickly douses his food.

      Ted pulls up in front of Paul's home.  He stares at something that looks like a
      tree on the front lawn.  He looks closer -- it's a "For Sale" sign.

                                  TED
              Blowing town, are we, Mr. Barnell?  I don't think so.

      Ted staggers through the snow to the sign and drunkenly pushes it down into
      the snow.

                                  TED (cont'd)
              I'm not done yet "travel man!"  You hear me?!

      LAUGHING, he takes some matches from his pocket and tries to light the "For
      Sale" sign on fire.  It's no use.  He quits.  He's cold now.  He gets up and
      staggers back to his car.

      Raymond, half in the bag, sits on the sofa.

                                  RAYMOND
              See, I could have had her.  We both know that, but I
              figured, she was such a... I mean, I don't know why...
              You know why?

                                  PAUL (O.S.)
              No.  You want a refill?

                                  RAYMOND
              Does a duck shit under water?

      Paul walks in with two glasses.  He hands Raymond the larger.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Any trouble getting the bank to handle that much
              cash?

                                  PAUL
              They said it'd be in tomorrow by --

                                  RAYMOND
              Right, right, you told me.  Then all we have to do is
              get her and the thing... Hey, remember that time in
              school, when I jumped out and scared you, and you
              fucking pee'd all over yourself?

                                  PAUL
              Was pretty funny.
                        (raises his mug)
              Bottoms up.

                                  RAYMOND
              Okay, "Puddles."  Remember how they called you
              that?  Huh, "Puddles?"
                        (about to drink - then)
              Christ, what time is it?

                                  PAUL
              It's early.  Come on... ya...
                        (uncomfortably)
              ...pussy.

      Raymond LAUGHS, takes the drink.

      A beautiful winter's night, the soft snowy silence broken only by Raymond's
      drunken shot of...

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)
              Pussy!!!

      A startled rabbit scurries across the snow.

128   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / VARIOUS - LATER                                   128

      Raymond is passed out on the sofa.  Paul sits, gun in hand, the barrel pointed
      at Raymond's forehead.  His finger grazes the trigger...  but it's suddenly all too
      real.  Paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again.  Not wanting to
      be sprayed by Raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head...  Another idea
      comes to him.  Paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the
      blow back.

      He gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at Raymond.
      Maybe it's the light... maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he
      looks almost angelic.  Paul stares at his brother.

      In the kitchen, Paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into
      The cup and hides it on the top shelf.

      Paul puts the gun back.  Not sure of his next move, he spots the beat up clock
      radio lying next to his brother.

      Margaret, still tied up, lays on top of the bed covers.

      Gary walks past, looks in, checks his watch, then heads to the bathroom.

      Margaret listens as Gary turns on the jacuzzi tub jets.  As he starts singing,
      Margaret sits up and scooches over to the phone on the end table.  Her hands
      tied loosely to her chest, she manages to dial by placing the phone receiver flat
      on the bed.

                                  JIMBO (O.S.)
              Gary!  You seen my shirt?

      Margaret looks over to see Jimbo, wearing Paul's pajamas, walking past while
      shaving with a portable razor.  As the line rings.

                                  JIMBO (O.S.) (cont'd)
              Aw jeez, again?

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              It relaxes me.  You know it has twelve different
              settings?

                                  JIMBO (O.S.)
              No Gary, I don't know that because every time I
              thought about using it someone was in it.

                                  GARY (O.S.)
              Hey, I do a lot around here.

      Paul, quiet as a mouse and dressed in his money-lined parka, picks up his
      cell and his car keys, drops them quietly into his pocket.  Just as he finishes...

      Not to worry.  Raymond has already rolled over.

      Margaret has just dialed another number.  It RINGS on the other end... And
      RINGS... And connects.

      A woozy Ted is trying to keep Tiffany's phone from RINGING.

      Finally, he puts on the headset and hits a computer key.  It connects.

              Yeah?  Hello?  (coughs)  Hello?

      He hits a few keys on the computer keyboard.  The screen pops to life.  The line
      connects.

                                  MARGARET
              Oh thank fucking Christ.  Is Tiffany there?

                                  TED
              No, she's...

      He pulls off a yellow Post It note stuck to the computer.  It reads:  "Coffee made.
      Don't touch my computer.  Back in 10."

      Unseen on the computer screen beside him, the name "Margaret Barnell"
      pops up, along with all her pertinent information like pet's name, husband,
      delusions...

                                  TED (cont'd)
              She'll be back in a few minutes.  You want to try
              later?

                                  MARGARET
              Well you should know, fuck-wit.  You know there's a
              man with a gun in my shower, right now?

      Ted, distracted, turns as he hears the doorknob turning.

              Hang on, she's on her way --

      But before she can answer, Tiffany walks in carrying a laundry basket, pulls the
      headset off Ted's head and holds it up to her ear.

      Tiffany shoves Ted, who loses his balance and stumbles backward.  She puts
      on the headset.

              Sorry about that.  Mrs. Barnell?  Could you speak up
              a bit?

      Ted is at her side, trying to listen in by pressing his ear to the outside of the
      headset.

      Ted's throat seizes up again.  He stumbles to the kitchen, gulping water from

              Maybe you have to be like this right now, and I'm just
              not in a good space to deal with it.  But...

                                  TED
              But what?

                                  TIFFANY
              Maybe we shouldn't be like this together.

      Tiffany gives him that look every man who's ever crossed the line for the last
      time is all too familiar with.

      Ted stares.  Words fail him.  Finally, his only recourse is to hurry out the door
      which shuts with a BANG.  Tiffany lets the phone continue to RING as she
      stares at the door.  Sadly, she hits the computer key that picks it up.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Psychic Buddies.  How are you Mr. Bennett?  I think
              she'd be fine with you remarrying, but hang on, let
              me concentrate.

      Ted opens the door, steps back inside.

                                  TED
              OK.  Come on.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (to Ted)
              Really?

                                  TED
              I've been cutting you out of my life and as a result our
              normal communication channels have been
              blocked.  I think you coming with me would... would...

      He's reaching, but Tiffany looks cautiously hopeful.

              ...further the development of our relationship and
              allow us to both... realize the potential of our...
              interpersonalism.

                                  TIFFANY
              If you're going to be sarcastic.

                                  TED
              I'm not being anything.  Swear to God.

                                  TIFFANY
              Okay.  Why do you want me to come?

                                  TED
                        (total sincerity)
              Cause if you don't, then I'll have to stay, and I'll be
              mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and
              as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a
              million times worse.

      Tiffany smiles, genuinely touched.

                                  TIFFANY
                        (into the phone)
              Mr. Bennett, she's totally cool with it.  but listen,
              you're gonna have to call back... I gotta go help my
              boyfriend.

      Paul drives, smiling for the first time in a long time.  He listens to the
      beautifully wrenching Iz-Kamakawiwo'Ole's version of "Somewhere Over the Rainbow"
      on the radio.  (The music continues over the next two scenes.)

      entirely sure what emotional sign-post they just passed.

      Gary and Jimbo, with Margaret, hands bound, walk into the garage.  Jodie (the
      dog) runs out after them.  Margaret looks at Jimbo, who takes the dog and
      gently puts him back inside.

                                  TIFFANY
              Okay, it's called the listening game.  You talk, I listen,
              and I can't interrupt.  Then we switch.

                                  TED
              Doesn't sound like much of a game, but...  I can talk
              about anything?

                                  TIFFANY
              Yes.

      Ted smiles, and launches in...

144   INT. JIMBO'S CAR / CITY STREETS - LATER                                      144

      Gary leans into the backseat and holds a magazine in front of Margaret's face.

                                  GARY
              See the little box down there?  Lists all the
              symptoms of that Tourette's thing, and you don't
              have half of them.

              And?  And you're faking it.

                                  MARGARET
              Magazines don't prove anything.

                                  JIMBO

                                  RAYMOND (O.S.)
              That little prick!!!

      As the camera rushes the mobile home, from inside comes the sounds of a
      very angry man.  Then, just as we're at the door, it SLAMS OPEN.  Raymond
      stands in the doorway, a mountain of anger in a hastily pulled on parka.

      He's holding the clock radio by the cord.  He checks his wristwatch, then
      smashes the clock radio against the trailer.

      Stalking toward his car, he checks the pistol in his side pocket, then, almost as
      an afterthought, opens the clip.  No bullets.  He smiles.

      A not-well-frequented tourist spot, featuring an expansive, far-as-the-eye-can
      see carpet of white.  The road from the turnoff is about 200 yards long, leading
      to a plowed out parking area.  The road is the only way in or out.  Paul's car
      takes the corner and heads toward the parking area.

              You can't be serious.

                                  JIMBO
              It's a thought, okay.  With hard work, you can live okay
              as a civilian.

                                  GARY

              Don't you go soft on me, Jimbo.

      Margaret LAUGHS through  her gag in the backseat.  Gary and Jimbo pretend
      not to hear her.  They drive on in silence.

      Tiffany and Ted drive.  Ted has just finished.  Tiffany has been paying rapt
      attention.

                                  TIFFANY
              So this is kind of like a really weird "Law and Order"
              episode?

              Sure.  I guess.

      Ted's car pulls up at the far end of the lot, about 200 yards from where Paul,
      Gary and Jimbo are parked.  Paul's car is in between Ted's car and Jimbo's.

      Paul gets out of his car, as do Jimbo and Gary.  Paul looks for Margaret in the
      back of Jimbo's car, but she remains lying down on the backseat.

                                  JIMBO
              Mr. Barnell.  I'll assume you've got our friend back

      Ted looks at Paul's car, too far away to see much.   He's about to get out when
      Tiffany stops him.

              Soon as I... if he actually is doing... something.  I'll
              wave, alright?

      Tiffany gives him a quick kiss.

                                  TIFFANY
              That's a very good plan.

      Ted's about to jump out of the car, but has to pull back his door as another
      vehicle slides in beside them, the driver locking his brakes and sliding into the
      snow embankment.

              Tourists.

      Ted, a confused look on his face, looks over as Raymond gets out of his
      vehicle.

      Black.  The lid opens.  Jimbo, Gary and Paul look in at the frozen body.  Jimbo
      recoils at the mangled mess before him.  Gary reaches down and touches the
      well-chewed body.

              That came out so wrong.

              Go away, now.

      Raymond walks on.  Ted, realizing he has no choice, runs and jumps in front of
      Raymond, blocking his way.

      At Jimbo's car, Gary is folding the corpse into the trunk as Jimbo pulls Margaret
      upright from the backseat and tugs down her gag.  She smiles at him as, with
      great care, he helps her out of the car and presents her to her husband.

      That's when Paul sees what Jimbo and Gary are watching.

      Raymond kicks Ted in the head, turns, spots Paul and breaks into a run.

                                  MARGARET
              Why?

                                  PAUL
              I'll catch up in a bit.  Now, no matter what you hear,
              just keep going, alright.  And if I'm... late or
              something, just look in the coat, alright?

      Margaret nods, kisses her husband quickly on the cheek, then starts to walk
      off.

      Paul, Gary and Jimbo watch, transfixed at the down-parka'd shit-storm that is
      headed their way.

                                  GARY
                        (nervous)
              Jimbo?

                                  RAYMOND
                        (yelling)
              A million dollars, Paul!?  You really think you could
              take me?  Again!

                                  JIMBO
              What million dollars?

      Gary and Jimbo look over at Paul, somewhat confused. Raymond's ten yards
      out, and they can now see he's taken out his gun.  He's aiming it at Paul.

      Paul looks over his shoulder at Margaret, who's having some trouble making it
      up a snow covered hill.

      Gary's hand slips into his pocket, grabbing hold of his gun.  Raymond,
      oblivious, moves right past.

159   INT. TED'S CAR                                                               159

      Tiffany finally looks over at Ted, who's just getting to his feet.  She bursts out 
      of the car...

160   EXT. PARKING AREA / BY PAUL'S CAR                                            160

      Raymond reaches Paul, takes the gun and points it at the top of his head.
      Paul's eyes shut tight, expecting the worst.

                                  PAUL
              Raymond... please.

      But shooting your brother is tougher than it looks. Paul opens his eyes.
      Raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't. He moves the barrel six
      inches to the right and shoots Margaret in the back.  She drops face first into
      the snow.

      Paul's world ends.

      Ears RINGING, he rushes toward his wife.

      Jimbo can't believe it as Gary holds him back.

                                  JIMBO
              Hey!  What the fuck!!

      Raymond, a look of relief on his face, turns to Jimbo.

                                  JIMBO (cont'd)
              She had nothing to do with this!

                                  RAYMOND
              And you do?

      But even before Raymond can raise his weapon, Gary pulls his gun and gets it
      pointed (shakily) at Raymond.

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Oh put it down, Nancy.

                                  GARY
              You first.

                                  JIMBO
              Gary!  Just --

      Raymond drops his gun to his side.  Gary smiles, too happy he won the face
      off.

                                  RAYMOND
              You win, tough guy.

      Gary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand.  As he does-- BANG!  The
      bullet rips into the snow about six feet from Raymond's feet.

      Raymond glares at Gary.  So does Jimbo.

                                  GARY
                        (meek, apologetic)
              Sorry.

      Jimbo lunges for cover as Raymond FIRES back.  Gary, truly terrified, closes
      his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run -- BANGBANGBANGBANG.

      One bullet bounces off Paul's car.  One hits Raymond.  With a quizzical look on
      his face, he drops to his knees.  A large crimson stain forms on his jacket.
      Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from...

      Paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body.

                                  PAUL
              Oh God... Oh Jesus...

                                  MARGARET
                        (muffled)
              Oh fucking hell... I can't... breath.

      Paul gently turns her over.  Margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch
      her breath.

                                  MARGARET (cont'd)
              Paul...  Someone kicked me.

      Paul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now
      embedded with the slug from the Raymond's gun.  He starts to weep tears of
      relief.

                                  PAUL
              Can you stand.

                                  MARGARET
              Is... The Pope... a...

                                  PAUL
              Okay, easy...

      Gary is behind the other car with Jimbo.

                                  GARY
                        (starting to lose it)
              He just, fell... Oh Jesus, oh God.

      Jimbo gently takes Gary's gun.

                                  JIMBO
              I know.

      As Jimbo puts an arm around Gary and helps him to the car, he sees Paul,
      arm around Margaret, coming their way.  Everyone stops.  A look passes, then
      both couples move off.

161   EXT. PARKING AREA - CONTINUOUS                                               161

      As Jimbo and Gary drive away, Paul brings Margaret to his vehicle.  Spotting
      Raymond, he walks over, kicks the gun away, then leans down.  Raymond's not
      dead, but he's close.

      Paul has to turn away.

                                  RAYMOND
                        (laboured)
              Look at me, you little...

      Paul turns back, not angry, not frightened, just a little sad.  Raymond, taken
      aback for a moment, tries for one last verbal shot, but all he can manage is...

                                  RAYMOND (cont'd)
              Puddles.

      And Raymond dies.

162   EXT. PARKING AREA - CONTINUOUS                                               162

      Paul turns back to his car when he spots a delirious, damaged Ted stumbling
      toward him with Tiffany desperate to drag him the other way.

                                  TED
              Where do think you're going?

                                  TIFFANY
              Ted, leave him alone.

                                  TED
              No, no, no.  I have been beaten, humiliated, had my
              head squeezed by a guy... and I am getting some
              answers, right now.

      Ted, barely able to stay on his feet (concussion) gets in front of Paul, and just
      stands there and waits.  Paul can't help but feel bad for the guy.

                                  PAUL
              Okay.

                                  TED
              Well go ahead.
                        (re: his left ear)
              I can still kind of hear out of this one.

                                  PAUL
                        (a long pause)
              I love my wife, Mr. Watters.  And when you love
              someone, I mean, really love someone...

      The punch hits Paul on the top of his head.  He stumbles back, but Ted is on
      him before he can move out of range.  It's a strange looking fight between the
      younger (physically spent) and older (emotionally drained).

                                  TED
                        (between punches)
              I want a fucking Hallmark card or the lyrics to a
              Foreigner rock ballad, I'll go to the mall, Mr. Barnell.

      Margaret and Tiffany jump in, trying to pull the two men apart.

163   INT. PAUL'S CAR - LATER                                                      163

      The car is still in the parking area.  Paul and a bloody, beaten Ted sit up front
      with Margaret and Tiffany in the back.  No one speaks, until...

                                  TIFFANY
              They call this the listening game.  Mr. Barnell, you
              get to go first.

      Ted glares at Tiffany, but her look instantly softens him.  Ted looks at Margaret,
      who looks expectantly at Paul.  Ted shrugs.

                                  TED
              Knock yourself out.

      Paul starts to talk, and Ted starts to listen...

      Arnith (the grave digger) walks to the side of a casket.  He hits the switch and it
      starts to drop.  Arnith watches impassively, taking brief note of two people up
      the hill before returning to his work.

165   EXT. GRAVEYARD HILL - CONTINUOUS                                             165

      It's Gary and Jimbo, dressed in black.  They watch silently as Raymond is laid
      to rest.

166   EXT.  TROPICAL BEACH - DAY                                                   166

      The sun beats down on a white sand tropical paradise.  The wind is calm, the
      water azure blue.  Perfection, except for the -- SNOW.  Big pure white flakes,
      cutting across this idyllic --

      Poster that hangs in a BOOK STORE window.  We are...

167   EXT. STREET / LIBERTY CAPITAL TOWERS - DAY                                   167

      Tiffany stares at her reflection in the window, her face transported to an island
      paradise.  Ted walks out.

                                  TIFFANY
              Hey.

                                  TED
              Hey yourself.

                                  TIFFANY
              So where you want to go?

                                  TED
              Somewhere close.  My three o'clock's been moved
              up.

                                  TIFFANY
              Cool.  You alright about everything?

                                  TED
              Yeah.  The life policy was written on his brother, and
              he did, you know, die.  I may be rationalizing a bit, but
              ethically I think I'm okay.

                                  TIFFANY
              Good.  I like it when you're okay.

      The two walk down the street.  Snow keeps falling.  Tiffany shuts her eyes,
      looks straight up as the gossamer snowflakes land and melt on her face.
      She's never looked more beautiful.

                                  TIFFANY (cont'd)
              Don't ya just love this weather?

      Ted stares at her.

                                  TED
              Learning to.

      Tiffany grabs his hand and pulls him away, disappearing into the whiteness.

A168  INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       A168

      Paul, sitting alone, reads a postcard from Margaret.

                                  MARGARET (V.O.)
              Pauly, know it sounds corny but I miss you so much!
              Wish you could have come.  Saw some dolphins
              today.  Frisky little buggers.  They were even playing
              our song in the bar.  Have been pondering about
              your question, and I think my answer is "yes."  After
              all, it's no fun in the sun without...

                                  MARGARET (O.S.) (cont'd)
              Paul, you ready?

      Paul looks up to see Margaret.  Dressed in a coat, she is standing in the
      middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor
      lamp.

      Paul flips Margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded Hawaiian Hilton
      postcard from the box in his den.

      Paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his
      arm.  Margaret picks up Jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over.

      A CAR HORN sounds from outside.  It's their cab.  As they walk to the door...

                                  PAUL
              How you feeling?

                                  MARGARET
              Pretty damn good.

                                  PAUL
              I can tell.

                                  MARGARET
              Can you?

      Paul takes her hand and gives it a squeeze.  They head out.

      Snowing now, as various PEOPLE walk toward the aircraft and the portable
      stairs rolled to the door.

      Paul and Margaret among the crowd, exchange nervous but hopeful smiles,
      then they are lost along with the other pilgrims in the swirling white.

                                                                        FADE TO BLACK.

      Dave and his WIFE (50s) walk out of their house toward their  car.  They get in,
      Dave behind the wheel.

171   INT. DAVE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                 171

                                  DAVE
              Why don't we go there after?
                        (off her look)
              Fine.  We'll do it now.

                                  DAVE'S WIFE
              Watch the curb.

      Dave keeps backing up.  As he takes the corner and bumps over the curb, the
      momentum sends the half-eaten body (that Gary and Jimbo stuffed into the
      backseat) to an upright position.

      They drive on, oblivious.

                                  DAVE
              Looks like weather.

                                                                          FADE TO WHITE.
BLAST FROM THE PAST - by Bill Kelly and Hugh Wilson





   


       FADE IN:



       SCENE 1 OMITTED

       EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

       OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
       BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
       PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
       shakes.

       INT. JET

       The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
       relaxes.

       EXT. JET

       We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
       plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
       from that period has been playing throughout.

       EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT

       Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
       music becomes source.

                           HELEN
                 For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got
                 guests!

                           CALVIN
                 Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling
                 with this darn rheostat.

                           HELEN
                 Well, put it down and come in!

                           CALVIN
                 You bet, hon!

       They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left
       the ham radio on.

       The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on
       his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that
       hangs loosely from his helmet.

                           PILOT
                 Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem
                 here.

                           TOWER (OC)
                 Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you
                 declaring an emergency?

                           PILOT
                 Stand by. One.

       INT. DINING ROOM

       DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet
       table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.

                           BETTY
                 Just remember: don't mention the
                 communists!

                           DAVE
                 Calvin's a great guy, but he's a
                 little, you know...

                           BETTY
                 Nutty.

                           RUTH
                 What's his wife like?

                           BETTY
                 Oh, you know, housewife.

                           DAVE
                 Likes to cook. Pregnant.

                           RUTH
                 Normal, then.

                           BETTY
                 Well, I wouldn't go that far.
                     (then)
                 Helen!

       Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She
       favors June Allison.

                           HELEN
                 Hi, Betty!  Dave!

                           BETTY
                 Just look at you!

                           HELEN
                 Any day now!

                           BETTY
                 This is my sister and her husband.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, hi! Welcome!

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.

                           CALVIN
                 So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
                 "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And
                 the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
                 a check?"  And the duck says, "Just
                 put it on my bill!"

       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
       sight-line rolls his eyes.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
       serving everyone.

                           DAVE
                 He was the golden-boy professor at Cal
                 Tech.  But then he starts inventing
                 things.

                           BOB
                 What kind of things?

                           DAVE
                 You got me.  Some kind of special
                 synthetic rubber.  And some kind of
                 automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly
                 he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits
                 teaching.

       ANGLE - CALVIN

       as his guests sample their Rob Roys.

                           CALVIN
                 How's that?

                           GUEST
                 Just what the doctor ordered!

       Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.

       ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH

       over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through
       the window.

                           BETTY
                 With all his money they could have
                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they
                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin
                 spends all his time tinkering out
                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me
                 it's all very strange.

                           WOMAN GUEST #1
                     (chiming in)
                 He dug a huge hole out there for a
                 swimming pool. Then he decided he
                 didn't want it and filled the thing
                 in. And what's that big, high fence
                 for?

       The women look at Calvin.



       ANGLE - CALVIN

       with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.

                           CALVIN
                 There currently exists a type of neon
                 light that lasts five years.  But you
                 won't see it on the market. Same is
                 true of batteries. I could take your
                 simple yacht battery and rig it to
                 last a decade, easily.

                           HAROLD
                 Well, what the heck kind of a
                 marketing system can't get great new
                 products like that out to the public?

                           CALVIN
                     (intense)
                 A veeeery good one, Harold. Free
                 market capitalism may not be a perfect
                 order, but it's the best we've got, or
                 will ever have.  And why?  Three
                 reasons!

       Poor Harold.

       INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen
       out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily
       jumps around the kitchen.

                           WOMAN GUEST #2
                 Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think
                 about this trouble down in Cuba?

                           HELEN
                     (rolling her eyes)
                 Oh, please don't bring that up!

       EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER

       A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into
       the house.





       SCENE 8 OMITTED

       INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER

       Calvin is with another guest.

                           CALVIN
                 I'd say my baseball card collection is
                 as complete as any one I've ever seen.

       Ron pushes his way through the crowd.

                           RON
                 Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!
                 		(pointing over his shoulder)
                 Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with
                 Khrushchev on the television!

       Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others
       follow.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.
       There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears
       shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.

                           JFK
                 ...this sudden, clandestine decision
                 to station strategic weapons for the
                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is
                 a deliberately provocative and
                 unjustified change in the status quo
                 which cannot be accepted by this
                 country.

       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
       it.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF
       SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.

       INT. JET COCKPIT

       The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a
       very hard time controlling it.

                           TOWER
                 Wolf One -- say intentions.

                           PILOT
                 I've got secondaries of an engine fire
                 and I'll need to find a clear area to
                 eject.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to
                 the ocean?

       EXT. JET

       The trembling plane circles to the west.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM

       Return to TV.

                           JFK
                 ...we will not prematurely or
                 unnecessarily risk the cost of
                 worldwide nuclear war, in which even
                 the fruits of victory would be ashes
                 in our mouth.  But neither will we
                 shrink from the risk at any time it
                 must be faced.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER

       To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the
       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
       in the middle we cut outside.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry everyone, but given this
                 extraordinary turn of events, I think
                 it's prudent that we cut the evening
                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
                 resolve itself, but in the
                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a
                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

                           HELEN
                 We'll do this again! Maybe next week.
                 Here's your hat. Could I wrap
                 something up for you? Did you have a
                 coat?

       Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin
       shuts the door.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       Following their wives out.

                 			DAVE
                     (sotto to Bob)
                 What'd I tell ya?!

       Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.

       INT. FRONT DOOR

       Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.

                           CALVIN
                 It's time.

                           HELEN
                     (misinterpreting, holding her
                      stomach)
                 Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time
                 yet. I still have--

       He points down.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm
                 not sure I'm really ready for this.

                           CALVIN
                 On the contrary, I think we're the
                 only ones who are.

       He leads her out of shot.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin I'm sure everything's going to
                 be all right. I just know it is!

       EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
       has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The
       Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
       wrapped in foil.

                           HELEN
                 Well, I'm certainly not going to let
                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you
                 just put that seat cover back on that
                 lawn chair?

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Shouldn't we at least turn off the
                 phonograph?

                           CALVIN
                 It shuts off automatically.

                           HELEN
                 Did you rig it to do that? You're so
                 clever.

                           CALVIN
                 No.  They all do.

                           HELEN
                 I never know anymore.

       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and
       looks up.

                           CALVIN
                 I bet that's a fighter jet on his way
                 to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!

       INT. WORKSHOP

       They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--
       mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.

                           TOWER
                 An emergency has been declared. I
                 repeat, an emergency has been
                 declared.

       Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling
       other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.

                           CALVIN
                 You hear that?!

                           HELEN
                 Yes.

       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.

                           CALVIN
                 We can listen to the rest downstairs!

       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then
       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while
       he and Helen are chatting:

                           HELEN
                 Calvin, I wish you would have at least
                 let me do the dishes. It's not going
                 to be that easy getting all that dried-
                 on food off my nice plates.

                           CALVIN
                 I just hope those plates aren't
                 radioactive by tomorrow morning.

                           HELEN
                 Cheese is particularly troublesome.

                           CALVIN
                 Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
                 Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
                 that?

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast
                 and watch your step.  I'll come back
                 for the radio.

       She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.


       INT. JET - NIGHT

       The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey
       cockpit.

                           PILOT
                 Tower, say again!!

                           TOWER
                 The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
                 sight.

                           PILOT
                 I'm marking the 180 radial for five
                 and ejecting.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One.




       The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and
       reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.

       EXT. JET

       The pilot ejects.

       INT. EMPTY COCKPIT

       This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the
       coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-
       turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.

       EXT. JET

       Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of
       sparks.

       EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT

       He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It
       misses him by a matter of yards.

       INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS

       Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them
       down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.
       On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.

                           HELEN
                 How long will we have to stay down
                 here?

                           CALVIN
                 I don't know. For this thing to blow
                 over, it could take days.

                           HELEN
                 Days??

                           CALVIN
                 Rather safe than sorry. That's my
                 motto!

                           HELEN
                 But, what if I go into labor? That
                 could happen any time.

                           CALVIN
                 I've read up on it. I'll deliver the
                 baby myself if I have to.

                           HELEN
                 Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,
                 when this baby comes, you're going to
                 be out in the waiting
                 room smoking yourself to death with
                 all the other fathers.

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 Yes, dear!

                           HELEN
                 As long as we've got that straight.

       EXT. JET - SAME TIME

       It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree
       angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES
       STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it
       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.

       INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the
       roast.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as
       the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.



       INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

       They step into a darkened room.

                           CALVIN
                     (with arms spread)
                 Home sweet home!

                           HELEN
                 To you maybe.

       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a
       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder
       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
       begins to shut by putting his body into it.

       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The
       LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK
       BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
       to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick
       of time.

                           HELEN
                 What was that?!

                           CALVIN
                 Are you all right?!

       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
       brave.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, I think so.

       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
       labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that
       are dropping to zero.

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that
                 heat!!  All my surface indicators are
                 knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's
                 actually happened!!

       INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER

       The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.
       A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME
       CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.

       BACK TO SCENE

       The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS
       with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the
       SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.

                           HELEN
                 What's that noise?

                           CALVIN
                 The locks.

                           HELEN
                 The locks?

                           CALVIN
                 To keep us from trying to leave. After
                 an atomic blast there's a radiation
                 half-life that lasts thirty five
                 years.

                           HELEN
                 Thirty -five years!

                           CALVIN
                 Then after that it's safe.

                           HELEN
                 It's safe.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                 To go up.

                           HELEN
                 To go up.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                     (confidently)
                 Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're
                 going to be just fine.

       Helen bursts into tears.

       EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY

       Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.
       Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet
       from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's
       left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.

                           LEVY
                 According to Caltech, this Webber guy
                 was a bonafide genius and a borderline
                 nutcase.

                           ATKINSON
                 Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
                 been out here when the plane hit.

                           LEVY
                 Unless we get a postcard or somethin',
                 that's my guess.

                           ATKINSON
                 What about relatives?

                           LEVY
                 All back East.

                           ATKINSON
                 The neighbors over there said the guy
                 spent day and night out here. She'd
                 bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.
                 Pepper.

                           LEVY
                 He drank it hot?

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.

                           LEVY
                 Good god.

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.



       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)

       Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and
       trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs
       up and exits.

       INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO

       Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty
       Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin
       is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey! Feeling better?

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 We have to be strong, sweetheart. If
                 not for ourselves, for the child.

                           HELEN
                 All our friends...

       He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.

                           CALVIN
                 Burnt to a crisp.
                     (indicating sandwiches)
                 I've given you the most well-done cut.

                           HELEN
                 I'm not hungry.

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

                           HELEN
                     (leaving)
                 No, Calvin, you're favorite.

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

       She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if
       cold.

                           CALVIN
                 A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.
                 Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.



       He follows her out to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 Maybe I've just got the creeps.

                           CALVIN
                 How could you?! This is just like
                 home!

       A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the
       fallout shelter -- which looks very different from
       "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.

                           HELEN
                 No. No! Calvin, this is different!
                 Believe me!

                           CALVIN
                 Would you like a tranquilizer?

                           HELEN
                 You have tranquilizers?

                           CALVIN
                 I told you! I've got everything!











        Helen groans in pain.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no.

                           CALVIN
                 What?

                           HELEN
                 Uh, oh. Now it's time.

                           CALVIN
                 Honey?

       SCENE 29E OMITTED



       INT. VERY WIDE OF THE SHELTER - HOURS LATER

       We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world. There is
       Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by
       Calvin's rejoicing.

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 The first child to be born on earth
                 after the annihilation!!



       INT. SHELTER - DAYS LATER

       SUPER: SEVERAL DAYS LATER

       Start on the record player in the living room. The
       country and western classic "Hey, Good Looking" is
       spinning.



       OMIT SCENE 30

       INT. SHELTER, BATTERY ROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by
       what he sees.  He exits. ("Hey Good Looking" continues.)

       INT. SHELTER, FISH FARM - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.
       Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six
       feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he
       hurries away.(Music continues)

       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM

       Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his
       family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in
       bed.

                           CALVIN
                 Is there a problem?

                           HELEN
                 No, Calvin.  Babies cry.

                           CALVIN
                 I've noticed.

                           HELEN
                 What shall we call him?

       Calvin shrugs.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Well, I was thinking...in light of the
                 situation...that we should call him
                 Adam.  That's not sacrilegious is it?

                           CALVIN
                 No.  I think it's just right.

                           HELEN
                 And I was wondering...if...if I could
                 have a...

                           CALVIN
                 Yes!

                           HELEN
                 If I...you know...

                           CALVIN
                 What? Whatever you want, Helen!

       She points upwards.

                           HELEN
                 I want a bedroom ceiling.

       They both look up. Then he tells her.

                           CALVIN
                 You've got it!

       Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.

       A MONTAGE:  1) CALVIN , IN A LARGE SUPPLY ROOM, PICKS OUT
       THE PLYWOOD HE'LL NEED FOR THE CEILINGS. ( 60'S HAPPY,
       BUSY SCORE COVERS ALL THIS.)

       2) HELEN, CARRIES LITTLE ADAM (THREE DAYS OLD) ONTO THE
       FAKE PATIO (WITH THE PLASTIC PLANTS AND THE PLASTIC
       GRASS). SHE LOOKS UP AT CALVIN WHO'S ON A LADDER
       INSTALLING A CEILING.

       SUPER: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

       3) IN THE FAMILY ROOM, CALVIN SHOWS HELEN HOW HE'S RIGGED
       A PROJECTOR TO THROW A PICTURE ONTO THE TV SCREEN. SHE'S
       THRILLED TO SEE "THE HONEYMOONERS!" MAIN TITLES COME ON.
       ADAM, LYING ON A QUILT BY HELEN'S CHAIR, IS ABOUT FOUR
       WEEKS OLD. (IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE SEE A 8MM FILM
       BOX WITH THE "I LOVE LUCY" LOGO ON IT)

       SUPER: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

       4) TOTAL DARKNESS. THEN CALVIN FLICKS A SWITCH AND A BANK
       OF OVERHEAD LIGHTS COMES ON TO SIMULATE SUNLIGHT. UNDER
       THE LIGHTS ARE SOIL BEDS ON WOODEN TABLES. CALVIN IS
       EXCITED TO SHOW HELEN THE TINY, YOUNG CARROTS COMING UP.
       HELEN HOLDS ADAM AT THREE MONTHS OLD.

       SUPER: A YEAR LATER

       5) IN THE DINING ROOM, HELEN IS SERVING POT ROAST AND
       SOME VERY NICE LOOKING CARROTS. ADAM IS SIX MONTHS OLD.
       HE WATCHES HIS PARENTS AS THEY SAY GRACE.

       6) HELEN "SHOPS" FOR SUPPLIES IN THE LARGE STOREROOM.
       ADAM, ONE YEAR OLD, RIDES IN THE SHOPPING CART.(1963)

       7) CALVIN NETS A WIGGLING, FULLY GROWN FISH.

       8) THE FAMILY WATCHES "THE HONEYMOONERS" TOGETHER. (ADAM
       IS STILL ONE YEAR OLD.)

       CALVIN ENJOYS HIS PIPE IN THE LIVINGROOM

       9) CALVIN EXAMINES THE REAR HATCHWAY AS HELEN APPROACHES
       WITH ADAM IN HER ARMS.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin?!

                           CALVIN
                 Right here!

                           HELEN
                     (arriving)
                 We looked all over for you. What are
                 you doing back here?

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, I was just examining this rear
                 hatchway.

                           HELEN
                 Why?

                           CALVIN
                 No reason.
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, it's pretty clear that the front
                 entrance caved in when the bomb went
                 off. So, you know, when the time is
                 up, we'll have to return to the
                 surface using, you know, this back
                 entrance.  Which is very nice because
                 it has the service elevator!

                           HELEN
                 Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.  Well... yes.

       A sober beat, then:

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 You wanted to see me?

       Helen nods vigorously.

                           HELEN
                 Watch this!

                           CALVIN
                 What?

       She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little
       legs, steadying him at the shoulders.

                           HELEN
                 Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.

       And Adam takes his first step. And then another! And
       another! It's a joyous event.

       CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING
       AND THEN, AGAIN USING THE DEVICE OF A CUTAWAY, IT
       CONTINUES THROUGH DIRT AND SEDIMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE
       SURFACE-- WHERE THE BACKYARD AVOCADO TREES ARE BEING
       BULLDOZED AND THE BACK FENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN TORN DOWN.
       THE WEBBER HOUSE FACED A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT IT
       BACKED ONTO VICTORY AVENUE (OR ONE OF THOSE VALLEY
       AVENUES) AND IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES THOSE
       MAIN THOROUGHFARES WENT COMMERCIAL.

       A SIGN tells us that this is the future site of MOM'S
       MALT SHOP."

       Some WORKMEN with shovels have discovered the REAR
       SHELTER DOORS where they have been digging.



                           WORKMAN #1
                 Hey, Boss!

       The construction BOSS comes over for a look.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 What do you make of this?

                           BOSS
                 Damn if I know.

                           WORKMAN #2
                 I bet it's some kinda septic tank.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 I've never seen a septic tank that
                 looked like that.

                           BOSS
                 Well, don't fool with it. If it is a
                 septic tank, I sure as hell don't want
                 to open it. We'll just lay the
                 foundation over it.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 Okay.

       EXT. WEBBER HOUSE, PATIO (THE REAL ONE) - DAY, SAME TIME

       A Realtor steps out with A COUPLE looking to buy the
       house.

                           REALTOR
                 ...and since it's almost certain that
                 the Webbers were killed, the bank is
                 selling the house and that back parcel
                 over there that's been re-zoned
                 commercial. It's right there on the
                 avenue.

                           WOMAN BUYER
                 Is that where the plane crashed?

       She points out to a LEVEL LAWN where the shop used to be.
       We can see the Malt Shop construction crew beyond that.

                           REALTOR
                 Yep, right there.

                           MAN BUYER
                 This place gives me the willies.

                           REALTOR
                 Yeah, I know what you mean. But the
                 price is right.

       EXT. BACK AT THE MALT SHOP CONSTRUCTION SIGHT -
       CONTINUOUS, DAY

       The guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket
       slam to the ground hard.

       INT. BACK AT THE SHELTER REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader.

       INT. SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - EVENING (1965-66)

       SUPER: 1965

       Calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a Manhattan cocktail as
       Adam (three and a half) sits in his lap reading the title
       page from Alice in Wonderland.

                           ADAM
                 Al ice in won der lan.

       Calvin smiles pridefully over at Helen who works
       intensely on the couch making a coffee-can Santa from
       instructions in the The Redbook Crafts Collection.

                           CALVIN
                 Not bad for a three and a half year
                 old! I'd like to see the public school
                 system match that! I don't care how
                 terrific it is!

                           HELEN
                 Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like
                 his father. But you know, Calvin,
                 maybe he's a little...young for
                 school.

                           CALVIN
                 Nonsense. People have no idea what the
                 human mind is capable of. Look at us!

       Helen ponders that statement.


                           ADAM
                     (pointing to the book's art
                      work)
                 Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,
                 just like us.

       Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Will I ever get to go up on top?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, you certainly will. And you'll
                 find a nice girl and rebuild America.
                 Just the way it used to be.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be
                 making promises that perhaps can't be
                 kept.

                           CALVIN
                 I believe there will be other
                 survivors. In fact, I'm guessing
                 there's life on the surface, even now.
                 It's not life worth living perhaps,
                 but believe me, something's moving
                 around up there. And I don't just mean
                 the cockroaches.

       They both look nervously up at the ceiling.

       EXT. MOM'S MALT SHOP (NOW FINISHED) - DAY (1965-66)

       CARS PASS BY on the busy avenue.

       INT. MOM'S MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       CLEAN CUT SURFER KIDS are being served their favorite ice-
       cream and malt treats by MOM herself and a young SODA
       JERK. Appropriate music comes from the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 I'm going to need two more banana-
                 splits and a cherry coke!

                           SODA JERK
                 You bet, Mom! Coming up!

       Two YOUNG MEN IN BEATLE HAIRCUTS enter. Everyone looks at
       them in amazement. (Perhaps there is also a record change
       here.)

       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM - DAY (65-66)

       Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from
       materials available to him. He has had the forethought to
       bring down the books needed for his child's education.
       Little Adam is watching him.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Adam)
                 Nothing in the world is more fun than
                 learning new things.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

       The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they
       watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen
       wonders about that.

       INT. BEDROOM - LATER

       Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine
       bottle.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1970-71)

       SUPER: 1970

       Other buildings have been constructed around the malt
       shop. Foot and car traffic are heavier.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.
       Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has
       made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox
       plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five
       years older.

                           MOM
                 I can't tell the boys from the girls
                 anymore!

                           SODA JERK
                     (stoned)
                 Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

       Mom gives the Jerk a suspicious look.

       INT. SHELTER - DAY (1970-71)

       Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work
       from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room
       pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches
       with pride. Then she interupts.

                           HELEN
                 Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my
                 turn.
                     (holding out her hand)
                 Adam?

       He goes to her.

       INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER

       The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song
       begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has
       changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is
       watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and
       Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam
       is watching with pride.

       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1975-76)

       SUPER: 1975

       The place continues its decline. Acid rock plays loudly.
       Mom and the Jerk serve the smallish crowd.

                           MOM
                 I miss those nice flower-power kids.
                 How 'bout you?

                           SODA JERK
                     (after studying her for some
                      time)
                 Um...uh...

       The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes
       on the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 What the hell kind of music is that?!

       The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new
       music.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like
                 that.



       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM  (1975-76)

       The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class.  There are twin
       pictures of Ike and JFK on the wall.  Adam is eleven.

                           CALVIN
                 This is what money looks like.  It
                 comes like this, in coin, or like this
                 in paper.  Or you can have an
                 "investment."  These are stock
                 "certificates" that we bought in your
                 name.  Of course, they're worthless
                 now, but at one time they were quite
                 valuable.

                           ADAM
                 They're pretty.  Can I have them?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure. Now, let's move on to our French
                 exam.

                           ADAM
                 Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right!  It's Tuesday already!
                 By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 Tempus fugit!

                           CALVIN
                 En arte voluptus.
                 Que les bons temps roulÈ!

                           CALVIN
                     (marveling)
                 You know, you have a wonderful sense
                 of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn
                 doesn't fall very far from the tree.
                 By the way, it's time I gave you
                 something. Come with me.

       Adam follows his dad out.

       INT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

       They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck
       with a stick. She's not having a very good day. She wears
       her hair dryer but it's not plugged in.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey!

                           HELEN
                 Hi.

       INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see
       Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection.

                           ADAM
                 These are wonderful.

                           CALVIN
                 It's my entire baseball collection.
                 It's yours now.

                           ADAM
                 What's baseball?

                           CALVIN
                 It's a game, son. I can explain it
                 pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like a painting?

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 No, son. A pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like one of Mom's?

                           CALVIN
                 Uh, no. There's a man who throws the
                 ball -- to a man who has a bat.

                           ADAM
                 The nocturnal flying mammal?

                           CALVIN
                     (slightly pissed)
                 No. Sit down.

       They do.

       INT. SHELTER - NIGHT

       Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to
       show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen
       asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam
       passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking
       ceiling pipe.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       SUPER: 1991

       TWO PUNKS with spiked green hair enter to the strains of
       "My Sharona."


       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       Mom watches the punks enter. Then crosses to the Soda
       Jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead.

                           MOM
                 I'm selling this place.  I want out of
                 this hell hole!

                           SODA JERK
                 Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...

                           MOM
                 Buy it from me?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

                           MOM
                 I'll give it to ya, no money down.
                 The neighborhood has gone to hell
                 anyway.

       She walks off.

                           SODA JERK
                 Cool.

       INT. KITCHEN  (1995)

       SUPER: 1995

       Helen has prepared a birthday cake. Having no birthday
       candles, she's used three votive candles. We can hear
       Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room. (She and
       Calvin are now in their 60's.)

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 No, no! The runner on second goes to
                 third! He's out there!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Why?

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 Because he's forced out at third! It's
                 a force!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Then why go there?

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Because he must!

                           HELEN
                 Calvin!

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Coming!

       Calvin enters.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Yes, dear?

                           HELEN
                 Get the presents and do the lights.

                           CALVIN
                 You bet.

       Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole
       shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents
       wrapped in whatever is available.

       INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS



       Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the
       ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome
       face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before
       him.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

                           CALVIN
                 Blow out the candles!

                           HELEN
                 Make a wish!

       He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the
       presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.
       It's a green coat.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, boy! A jacket!

                           CALVIN
                 Your mom made that all by herself.

                           ADAM
                 No kidding!

                           HELEN
                 No kidding.
                     (aside, to Calvin)
                 Who else would have done it?

                           CALVIN
                 And I made these!

       He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the
       paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has
       redesigned. The new skates look kind of like
       rollerblades.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

                           CALVIN
                 Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!
                 I think this new design will work even
                 better!

                           ADAM
                 These are really swell! I mean swell!

                           HELEN
                 What did you wish for, Adam?

                           CALVIN
                 If he tells, it won't come true!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We
                 never believed that in my family!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we did in my family!

                           ADAM
                 I wished I could meet a girl.

       His parents don't have a reply for that.

                           HELEN
                 Oh. A nice one, I hope.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           CALVIN
                 One who doesn't glow in the dark.

                           HELEN
                 Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we'll be going up in two years.
                 We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

                           ADAM
                     (ardently)
                 Me, too.

       His parents stare at him for a beat, then:

                           HELEN
                 Let's eat our cake.

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah. Let's dig in!

       They do.

                           HELEN
                 Elbows, Son.

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, Mom!

                           HELEN
                 You never know. You may someday dine
                 at the White House with the president.

                           CALVIN
                 If we still have one.

                           HELEN
                 Yes...

                           CALVIN
                 You know, when we do go up...I'm going
                 to miss this old place. How 'bout you,
                 hon?

                           HELEN
                     (after a beat)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure.

       Helen rises and exits.

       INT. BATTERY ROOM- LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen enters and goes into the generator room. Through
       the glass we can see (and hear) her scream. Straightening
       her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin
       strolls by wearing his tool belt. She's headed out.

                           CALVIN
                 In the generator room again?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how
                 all    these things work.

                           CALVIN
                 I know exactly what you mean!
                     (then)
                 Hey, honey?

       She turns to him. He gives her his patented thumbs up
       sign.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Great cake!!

       She smiles wanely and leaves. He shuts the generator door
       she left open.

       SCENE 60 OMITTED



       SCENE 61 OMITTED

       INT.SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

       SUPER: THE PRESENT

       The room is quiet and empty.  The star-burst WALL CLOCK
       on the paneling says 6:15.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Also empty.

       INT. STOREROOM - SAME TIME

       Also empty.  And with MEAGER SUPPLIES on the shelves.

       INT. POWER AND PUMP ROOM - SAME TIME

       The old pipes are rusted and patched. Some are leaking
       badly.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.

       ANGLE - HELEN

       She wakes up. Then jumps out of bed.



       SCENE 67 OMITTED



       CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX

       that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years.
       Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM
       GOES OFF.  Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by
       throwing the lever up.

       ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT
       HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of
       the front hatchway and red box.

                           ADAM
                 So...we just open this door and go up?



       Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens
       the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when
       nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.

                           ADAM
                 Um...is that supposed to happen?

       His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs
       through the entire shelter to the back hatch door.  They
       knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam
       follows.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, where are we going?!  Is
                 everything all right?!

       INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't
       possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is
       out of breath.

                           CALVIN
                 Should we say a little prayer first?

                           HELEN
                 Just open the door.

       Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't.  Adam
       helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of
       squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and
       flips a wall switch.  Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON....
       And the service elevator is intact.

       INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The
       old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

                           ADAM
                 Well, do we just go on up?!

                           CALVIN
                     (quickly back to business,
                      and way too dramatic)
                 No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is
                 precisely when... we must be at our...
                 most cautious.

                           HELEN
                     (barely a whisper, but
                      definitely tired of his
                      B.S.)
                 Oh, shit.

       Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth.
       She is just as shocked as Calvin.

                           CALVIN
                 Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have
                 been down here a little too long!
                     (to Adam)
                 Please excuse her French.

                           ADAM
                 Shit is a French word?

                           HELEN
                 Yes, yes it is!

                           CALVIN
                 It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly
                 meaning..."good".

                           HELEN
                 Yes! That's right!

                           ADAM
                 Oh.
                     (then)
                 Well...then...shit!

       There is a pause, then:

                           CALVIN
                 C'est bon, Monsieur.

                           ADAM
                 Merci!

       SCENE 71 OMITTED



       EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT

       Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left
       of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front
       window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER
       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it
       is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.

       INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the
       Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a
       tattoo on his forehead.)

                           SODA JERK
                 ...all of these things...Alcoholics
                 Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin
                 Anonymous.

                           OTHER BUM
                 There's a Heroin Anonymous?

                            SODA JERK
                 Shut up! All of these things... ask
                 you to believe in a power greater than
                 yourself! Some sort of God on High!
                 Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a
                 time or two... and I have certainly
                 not seen anything coming from up there
                 except a goddamn airplane -- that I
                 can't afford to get on!

       The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER
       AND RUMBLE.

                           OTHER BUM
                 Earthquake!  Another earthquake!

                           SODA JERK
                 Let her come!  Let's get this over
                 with!  And please, if there is a God,
                 let it be worse in Bel Air!!

       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the
       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
       ticking.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!
                 For I have seen the light!!

       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

                           CALVIN
                 I come in peace!!

       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.

                           CALVIN
                 My, gosh...

       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He
       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH
       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING

       Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the
       avocado trees should be.

                           CALVIN
                 Where is my backyard?

       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
       to his left.

       EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING

       DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
       plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
       avenue.

       SCENE 76 OMITTED

       EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN

       Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai
       restaurant.)

       CLOSER ON HIM

       watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a
       cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a
       cigarette.

                           STREET WALKER
                 You got a light, honey?

                           CALVIN
                 What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a
                 light!

                           STREET WALKER
                 Good.

       Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with
       one of his kitchen matches.

                           CALVIN
                 So...you...survived the blast, did
                 you?

                           STREET WALKER
                 The blast?  Honey, I have survived a
                 host of things. Like the song says: "A
                 country boy can survive!"

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has
                 it been...hell up here?

                           STREET WALKER
                 "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell
                 up here, down there and over yonder!
                 Hell everywhere.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, I can tell that just looking
                 around.
                 		(then)
                 "Boy?"  Did you say you were a
                 "country boy?"

                           STREET WALKER
                 Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
                 boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want
                 a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be
                 anything you want me to be!

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

                           STREET WALKER
                 Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the
                 remarkably low price of only $200!
                 And if you act now, I might even throw
                 in some free lawn furniture.

                           CALVIN
                     (stumbling away from her)
                 No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to
                 go!  I have to...

       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
       is really a water gun.

       INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE

       Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

                           CALVIN
                 Hello!  How are you this evening?!
                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

       The clerk just watches him.

                           CALVIN
                 Thank-Q very much!

       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great
       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
       the corner.

                           CALVIN
                 I'm going to give it to you straight.
                 There's no point in beating around the
                 bush. There were survivors.
                 Apparently,
                 the fallout has created....a
                 subspecies of mutants.

                           HELEN
                 Mutants?!

                           CALVIN
                 It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover
                 your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that
                 literally and I mean right now!

       ADAM covers his ears and hums.

                           CALVIN
                 Others are...multi-sexual.  It
                 seems...they can be both masculine and
                 feminine...simultaneously.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 I don't believe it!

       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things
       that don't need to be done.


                           CALVIN
                 Believe it. He tried to sell me his
                 body, Helen.
                 		(beat)
                 They offer lawn furniture as a come
                 on!

       She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin
       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
       humming.

                           CALVIN
                 They've done a lot of re-building but
                 society, at least as we knew it, has
                 utterly collapsed. People throw up in
                 the streets. Others point guns.
                 There's something terribly wrong with
                 the automobiles and...and I...I can't
                 tell you the rest.  I just can't.

                           HELEN
                 Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,
                 what do we do now?

                           CALVIN
                 We stay down here.

                           HELEN
                 We do?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 Excuse me.

       She hurries into the living room.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into
       the kitchen.

       INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS



                           HELEN
                 For how long?  We've just about run
                 out of everything!

                           CALVIN
                 We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion
                 that these mutants will eventually
                 kill each other off and then--

                           HELEN
                     (rising)
                 No, Calvin.  We're not going to make
                 do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going
                 up no matter what!  We deserve it.
                 Even if it's terrible!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, I am the head of this household--

                           HELEN
                 I want him to at least see the sky!

                           CALVIN
                 --and we will--

                           HELEN
                 And the ocean!  A mountain range!

                           CALVIN
                 --do as I say!

       Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest
       in great pain and collapses.

                           ADAM
                 Dad!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get
                 him into the bedroom.

       INT. HALLWAY - HOURS LATER

       Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can
       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
       room. He follows.

                           HELEN
                 He seems to be doing all right now.  I
                 don't know if he's had a heart attack
                 or just... a horrifying experience.
                 But we  need supplies and I've got to
                 stay with him.

                           ADAM
                 I'll go up.

       They go through the living room and cross to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 I'm afraid you've got to.

                           ADAM
                 I'll be all right.

                           HELEN
                     (patting his cheek)
                 You're my brave boy.



       Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the
       fish farm.

                           HELEN
                 Just act normal.  If anybody asks,
                 simply say you're from out-of-town,
                 and that you're in town on business.
                 Write that down.

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to give you a shopping list
                 and some money.  We need just enough
                 things to get us through the next year
                 or two.  And you'll find most of these
                 items at what used to be called a
                 grocery store or a hardware store.
                 Write that down.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
       dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.

                           HELEN
                 I don't know how far you'll have to
                 travel to find supplies, but if you
                 can't get home by nightfall, I want
                 you to look for something called a
                 Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a
                 hotel. There might still be one
                 standing.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.


                           HELEN
                 Let's get you packed.

       She heads back for the house. He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           HELEN
                     (indicating money)
                 I just hope this is still good up
                 there.

                           ADAM
                 Mom?


                           HELEN
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking that, uh...you know,
                 while I was up there and all...that
                 maybe I could, you know...try to meet
                 a girl.  I've, been thinking about
                 that a little...just these
                 last...fifteen years or so.

       They have stopped by the garden.


                           HELEN
                 Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if
                 you could find a girl. One who's not a
                 mutant...and hopefully comes from
                 Pasadena. Nothing against Valley
                 girls,
                 but in my day anyhow, the girls from
                 Pasadena, I don't know...always just
                 seemed a little nicer.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       They hug.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, there's also a thing called a
                 liquor store. Write that down.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

       He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He
       studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and
       an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.
       Helen enters with a long shopping list.

                           HELEN
                 Here's the shopping list and $3,000
                 which should take care of everything.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           HELEN
                 Your father has a few final words for
                 you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw
                 for you - he loves you so much. We
                 both do.

                           ADAM
                 Heck, I know that mom! You're my
                 parents.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.
       He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her
       apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to
       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.

                           CALVIN
                 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

                           ADAM
                 Yes, father?! Yes?

                           CALVIN
                 ...the pipe tobacco.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir.  Is that all?

       Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But
       Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak
       weakly into his son's ear.

                           CALVIN
                 Also...stay out of the "Adult
                 Bookstore."

                           ADAM
                 Adult Bookstore.  Why?

                           CALVIN
                 Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

                           ADAM
                 I promise. Is that all?

                           CALVIN
                 One more thing. If you find a healthy
                 young woman, bring her back with you.

                           ADAM
                 I'll try.

       And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY

       The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious
       shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry
       and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and
       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,
       rocking back and forth as he prays.

       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the
       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

                           ADAM
                 Are you all right?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!
                 But  where is the one who came last
                 night -- all in yellow?!

                           ADAM
                 All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my
                 father!

                           SODA JERK
                 Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father!
                 Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for
                 my wasted life?!  Everything has been
                 so awful!!

                           ADAM
                     (comforting him)
                 I know it has been terrible.  But it
                 wasn't your fault. And now all the
                 decay is over with and things are
                 going to get better. You understand?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes.

                           ADAM
                 I've got to go, now.

                           SODA JERK
                 Of course you do.  I'll stay here and
                 pray.

                           ADAM
                     (picking up his suitcase)
                 That's always a good idea! Would you
                 like some money? I have a great deal
                 of it.

                           SODA JERK
                 No. I don't need money anymore -- I
                 see that now.

                           ADAM
                 How do I leave here?

                           SODA JERK
                 The front door is open.  Will you be
                 back?

                           ADAM
                 I promise.

       Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees
       and shakes all over.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on
       him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He
       looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he
       looks up at the sky.

       INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY

       And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1
       appears and sees Adam looking up.

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 What?  What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 The sky!!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 The sky?  Where?

                           ADAM
                     (pointing)
                 Up there!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 I don't see anything!

                           ADAM
                 Just look!!

       Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.

       A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                     (pointing)
                 He sees something.

                           MOTHER
                 What?

                           CHILD
                 I see it, mommy!

                           BYSTANDER #2
                 Where?!


       Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by
       in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it?

                           ADAM
                 I have never in my life seen anything
                 like this!!!! Nothing even comes
                 close!!

       Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK
       WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                 Whatcha looking at?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (with attitude)
                 Say what?!

                           ADAM
                     (offering his hand)
                 How do you do, ma'am.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (leary, but taking his hand)
                 I do alright.

                           ADAM
                 Good!

       The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.


                           PAKISTANI
                 What is it?!  What do you see?!

       When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult
       Bookstore" sign.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, no!

                           PAKISTANI
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life,
                 it's invisible poisonous gas!!!

       And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is
       left totally deserted.



       INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY

       Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for
       Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.

                           CALVIN
                 You know--

       Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the
       place.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 I just wanted to say that I think he's
                 going to be just fine.

                           HELEN
                     (holding her heart)
                 Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very
                 much.

       Calvin leaves, then comes back.

                           CALVIN
                 He's smart.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, dear, I know.



       SCENE 85A OMITTED


       EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY

       An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.



       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       is startled. He reacts.

       ANGLE - DRIVER'S FOOT

       slamming down the brake pedal.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       in profile. The braking bus stops an inch from his nose.
       Adam smiles. (Have him head for bus door in this angle.)

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       from over Adam. He is in shock.



       INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER

       Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus
       passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at
       him in amazement and some fear.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is
       carrying a $100 bill.)

                           ADAM
                 Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.

       Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young
       PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.

       ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM

       Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.

                           ADAM
                 I tried to give the driver this but he
                 wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A
                 lot of people do.

       The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an
       hour.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!
                 Wow.

       INTERCUT: PASSENGERS

       looking back at Adam with concern.

                           ADAM (CONT'D)

                 So this is public transportation. My
                 Dad says that it becomes more and more
                 important because of pollution --
                 which is more and more carbon dioxide
                 and other hazardous gases in the air.
                     (then, confidentially)
                 Do you have a gun, by the way?

       The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods
       that he does.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Well, thanks for not waving it around.
                 And for not vomitting, for that
                 matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,
                 do you know where I could find a
                 grocery store?

       The psycho shakes his head.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I have to find that. And a hardware
                 store  and a liquour store and a
                 standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may
                 not need the Holiday Inn. That's still
                 kind of up in the air. It depends
                 really on how things go.

                           PSYCHO
                     (pointing)
                 There's a grocery store coming up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!
                     (jumping up)
                 Driver! Please stop the bus
                 immediately! I have to get off!
                     (then an aside to the psycho)
                 Do you think I should get a gun?

                           PSYCHO
                 I don't know...maybe.

                           ADAM
                     (back to driver)
                 Driver! Please stop, sir!

       INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW

       He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.

       ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.

       who are anxious for Adam to leave.

                           OLD JEWISH MAN
                 For the love of God! Let him off the
                 bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!

       Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, what did you call me?

       The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to
       scream.

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT

       hitting the brakes.

       EXT.- BUS

       stopping suddenly. Through the windows we see Adam go
       down.

       INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

       The back door opens as Adam gets up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!

       Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,
       heaves a huge sign of relief.

       INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER

       Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors
       and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the
       magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.
       The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others
       do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.

       INT. BAKERY COUNTER

       Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention
       to the elaborate birthday cakes.

                           ADAM
                 Is that a birthday cake?!

                           CLERK
                 Yes, it is.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-ma-nee!

       Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.

                           CLERK
                 Bakersfield.

       INT. AISLE

       Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a
       mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds
       him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that
       way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so
       casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an
       unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He
       (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing
       trunks.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 My first mutants.

       INT. FRESH PRODUCE

       Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that
       always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-
       AMERICAN CLERK.

                           ADAM
                 Is this because of the radiation?

                           CLERK
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Nothing.

       INT. MEAT COUNTER

       Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps
       up.

                           BUTCHER
                 Help you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, please.
                     (consulting his Mom's list)
                 I'm looking for all beef patties.



                           BUTCHER
                 Fresh or frozen?

       Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.

                           ADAM
                 Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

                           BUTCHER
                 Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in
                 the three pound box.

                           ADAM
                 Then I'll need, twelve into nine
                 hundred, seventy-five boxes. And
                 that's almost...five hundred dollars
                 just for the hamburger! And my Mom
                 only gave me three thousand dollars
                 for everything! The yacht batteries!
                 The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

                           BUTCHER
                 You could have a meat order that big
                 delivered to your home.

                           ADAM

                 Really?!

                           BUTCHER
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 Well, that's great then!
                 Terrific...except...it just occurred
                 to me. I don't know where I live! I'm
                 lost! I don't know where home is!
                     (then)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           BUTCHER
                 Gladly.

       Adam hurries away.



       SCENE 93 OMITTED

       SCENE 94 OMITTED



       A MONTAGE

       of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the
       window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At
       one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders
       about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually
       late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more
       depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps
       up and tells the driver:

                           ADAM
                 Driver! Stop this bus immediately!
                 Please sir!!

       EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT

       The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the
       street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the
       other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his
       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost
       NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some
       time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself
       he turns and begins to walk south.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders
       about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

       WIDER ANGLE

       of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.

                           ADAM
                 Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,
                 my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!

       ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW



       A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &
       TRADED.

       INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar
       box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the
       owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a
       fondness for Navajo jewelry.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

                           JERRY
                     (gives him a look, then goes
                      back to reading)
                 Hi.

       A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes
       to another counter.  Neither man notices.

                           ADAM
                 The name is Adam Webber and I see you
                 buy baseball cards and although these
                 are a lot older than the ones in the
                 window, I was hoping you still might
                 be interested.

       He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches
       beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then
       must pretend the moan was a cough.

                           JERRY
                 How--how much do you want for the
                 Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking of selling all the
                 cards.

                           JERRY
                 Really? No kidding?

       He reaches in and looks through the cards.

                           ADAM
                 See, my problem is, all I have are
                 hundred dollar bills and I need
                 something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens.
                 Like that.

                           JERRY
                 I see what ya mean. Tell you
                 what...I'll give you five hundred
                 dollars in small bills for the whole
                 box.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that would be wonderful!

                           JERRY
                 Well, we're here to help!

       A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back
       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.

                           EVE (OC)
                 Oh, shit!

       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.


                           JERRY
                 I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't
                 screw me up.


                           ADAM
                 Bon soir, mademoiselle!

                           EVE
                 Are you French?

                           ADAM
                 No.
                     (then, thinking fast)
                 I'm from out of town.
                     (then sensing the need for
                      further clarification)
                 I'm here on business.

                           EVE
                 Well, your business must not be sports
                 memorabilia, because this one Mantle
                 card right here--
                     (holds up a card)
                 --is worth six thousand dollars all by
                 its little self.


                           ADAM
                 Get out of here!

                           EVE
                 No, you get out of here.

       She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.




                           JERRY
                 Terrific...you're fired! You know
                 that?!



                           EVE
                 No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.

       She walks back to the counter to get her coat.

                           JERRY
                 Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair
                 salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You
                 know why you can't keep a goddamn
                 job?!  Because you can't keep your
                 goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!

       Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm
       firmly.

                           ADAM
                 Sir? I would really appreciate it if
                 you wouldn't take the Lord's name in
                 vain again.

                           JERRY
                     (looking at Adam's hand)
                 Oh, you got a problem with that?


                           ADAM
                 I have a big problem with that.

       Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.



                           EVE
                 Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to
                 the corner.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.



                           EVE
                 Just come on.

       They head for the door and exit.

                           JERRY
                 Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect
                 match!  I hope you two will be very
                 happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov!
                 Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot!
                 I'm serious this time! You're finished
                 in the hobby business! Take that to
                 the bank, why don'tcha!

       Adam re-enters.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't want to leave without saying
                 how much I admire your jewelry.

                           JERRY
                 Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your
                 butt?

       Adam walks towards the man smiling.

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout you what?

       Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back
       in and pulls Adam out.

                           EVE
                 I said come on!



       Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.

       EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT

       They exit the store.

                           ADAM
                 Where are we going?

                           EVE
                 We? I'm going home. And, judging by
                 that coat, I'd say you have to get
                 back to the barber college.

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm lost.

                           EVE
                 You're lost?

                           ADAM
                 Say,...did you just lose your job
                 because of me?

                           EVE
                 Forget it.  I'm sick of working for
                 that dickhead.

                           ADAM
                 Dickhead?

                           EVE
                 A walking penis capable of intelligent
                 speech.  A dickhead.

       A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a
       store window and drop his box of cards.

                           EVE
                 What's wrong with you?

                           ADAM
                 I just had a mental picture of...

                           EVE
                 Here, pick these up!

       Together they pick up the cards.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Where are you parked?

                           ADAM
                 I came on a bus.

                           EVE
                 Why doesn't that surprise me?

                           ADAM
                 I don't know. Why doesn't it?

       They rise.

                           EVE
                 Well, I guess because I'm a little
                 psychic...I have this thing.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that's nice.

                           EVE
                 Let me guess something. This is your
                 first visit to La La Land. You're
                 staying somewhere over in Hollywood
                 because, like an idiot, you thought
                 that would be an exciting place to
                 stay.  Right so far?



                           ADAM
                     (could be a question, could
                      be an answer.)
                 So far?

                           EVE
                 Yes, I'm right?

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           EVE
                 I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus
                 and before you know it, you're out
                 here in the San Fernando Valley
                 without a clue.  Which brings us to
                 here.  Correct again?

                           ADAM
                 Again.

                           EVE
                 Where are you staying? The Holiday
                 Inn?

                           ADAM
                 Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's
                 exactly right!

                           EVE
                 See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but
                 pretty much. That was pretty good,
                 wasn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 It was amazing.

                           EVE
                 Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a
                 bus for you to get on.

                           ADAM
                 Do you own a car?

                           EVE
                 I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.
                 Rule Number One in North America: No
                 strangers in the car.

                           ADAM
                 If it will make you feel any better, I
                 don't have a gun.

                           EVE
                 You don't?

                           ADAM
                 Nope.

                           EVE
                 Well, that changes everything. Get the
                 fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

       She races around the corner.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry!  I said something wrong,
                 didn't I!  Please forgive me!

                           EVE
                 Get away from me!!

       She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal
                 with you!  I'll give you a Rogers
                 Hornsby, if you'll take me to the
                 hotel!

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby?!?

                           ADAM
                 He's all yours. I was holding him
                 back.

       Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows
       it to her.

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby's worth like four
                 thousand dollars!

                           ADAM
                 So what?!  I've got two of him!
                 		(removing more cards from his
                 		 pocket)
                 And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.
                 I was holding these out, too.

       She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks
       the driver's door.

                           EVE
                 So for four thousand dollars, all I
                 have to do is drive you to your hotel?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 And that's it?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 I don't have to take a physical in
                 your space ship?

                           ADAM
                 Heck, no!  What?!

                           EVE
                 Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal.
                 Get in.

       She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 The front seat!

       He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Why am I doing this? What in the hell
                 is wrong with me? That's what I'd like
                 to know.



       SCENE 99 OMITTED



       EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

       Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour. The dash
       lights fascinate him but the car scares him.  She notices
       that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life.

                           EVE
                 So...Mister Andretti, your first time
                 on the freeway?

                           ADAM
                 It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

                           EVE
                 Mind if I change the station?
                 Better traffic reports on AM.

       She switches over to AM and runs by a Perry Como record,
       "Round and Round", looking for traffic.

                           ADAM
                 Wait!  Wait!

                           EVE
                 What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 It's Perry!

                           EVE
                 Perry?

                           ADAM
                 Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back!
                 Go back!

                           EVE
                 Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

       She gets Perry.

                           EVE
                 How's that?

                           ADAM
                     (star-struck)
                 Oh, I could die...

                           EVE
                 Over this?

                           ADAM
                 Yeah! Listen to this part. This is
                 where it really takes off!

                           EVE
                 You are one scary son-of-a-gun.




       EXT. FREEWAY

       Eve's car splits for the exit ramp.

       INT. EVE'S CAR

       The sudden speed scares Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, what are you doing?!

                           EVE
                 I know a short-cut.

       EXT. OFF RAMP

       She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the
       surface street, tires squealing.

       INT. CAR

       Adam is hanging onto his seat belt. Eve puts the pedal to
       the metal.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

                           EVE
                 I can't help it. Perry Como always
                 does this to me! I just get so
                 cranked!

       She turns Perry way up.

       EXT. AVENUE

       Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing.  The
       little Geo's engine screams. Adam's sort of getting into
       it.

       EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - TEN MINUTES LATER

       The Geo flies up to a quick stop.

       INT. CAR

       Eve turns to Adam, who has had A Life Experience.

                           EVE
                 Card, please.  End of service.

       He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor.

                           ADAM
                 That was...wonderful!  I've never felt
                 anything like that in my life.

                           EVE
                 Yeah, same here. Don't forget your
                 suitcase.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

       He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the
       door leans down to speak to her.

                           ADAM
                 You know--

       She tears off, leaving him there.

       INT. HOTEL REGISTRATION - MINUTES LATER

       Adam addresses the clerk.

                           ADAM
                 Good evening. I want to stay at this
                 hotel.

                           CLERK
                 Fill this out please. And I'll need a
                 card.

                           ADAM
                 A card?

                           CLERK
                 Yes, sir.

                           ADAM
                 Of course!

       Adam gives him a baseball card.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

       A BELLBOY ushers Adam in and sets down his bag.

                           BELLBOY
                 Bathroom's there, TV's over there.
                 Remote's on top. Room Service menu is
                 on the table.

       Adam picks up the phone and listens.


                           BELLBOY (CONT'D)
                 You dial nine to get out.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 Of what?

                           BELLBOY
                     (beat, then)
                 The hotel.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then he hangs up)
                 I see.  Well, thank you very much.
                 You've been very, very nice.

       He offers two dollars.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I was able to get some change
                 downstairs and my father taught me
                 that it's customary to tip in a
                 situation such as this.

                           BELLBOY
                 Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

                           ADAM
                 My father is a genius.

                           BELLBOY
                 No kiddin'. Well...good night.

                           ADAM
                 Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let
                 the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom
                 always says...
                 		(choking up)
                 ...who I'm really beginning to miss.
                 I'm sorry.  It's my first night away
                 from home.

                           BELLBOY
                 How old are you?

                           ADAM
                 Thirty-five.

                           BELLBOY
                 You don't look thirty-five.

                           ADAM
                 How old do I look?

                           BELLBOY
                 Twenty-five? Around there.

                           ADAM
                 I guess living up here makes people
                 look older.

                           BELLBOY
                 Up here on the fifteenth floor?

                           ADAM
                     (catching himself)
                 Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
                 Goodnight.

                           BELLBOY
                 Goodnight.

       Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face.
       He goes to the window and looks out. The height scares
       him to death. He jumps back.



       INT. SHELTER, DINNER TABLE - SAME TIME

       Adam's parents pray.

                           CALVIN
                 And Lord we ask finally that you send
                 an angel to look after and protect our
                 beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

                           HELEN
                 Amen.

       She begins to tear up and he pats her hand.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

       Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - MORNING

       It's another bright, smoggy day.  And here comes Eve,
       marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance.

                           EVE
                     (skyward)
                 What in the hell am I doing here?!
                 That's what I'd like to know! Somebody
                 tell me that.

       INT. FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve is speaking to a DESK CLERK.

                           DESK CLERK
                 You don't have a last name?

                           EVE
                 All I know is that his first name is
                 Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a
       television commercial.The PHONE RINGS loudly.  Adam
       nearly jumps out of his skin.  After he figures out where
       the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone.

                           ADAM
                     (into phone, after a long
                      pause)
                 Yes?

       INT. LOBBY

       At the house phone.

                           EVE
                     (into phone)
                 Hi. This is the woman from the
                 baseball card store.  Remember me?

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM

       Boy, is he glad to hear from her!

                           ADAM
                 Yes!  Hello!  Hi!  Hot-diggity-dog!
                 Thank you for calling me on the
                 telephone!!

       INT. LOBBY

       Eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment.

                           EVE
                 Good grief. Hey listen, I'm in the
                 lobby.
                     (pause, then)
                 On the first floor! Where the hell
                 else would it be?


       INT. LOBBY, ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

       The doors open and Adam hurries out, looking for Eve, who
       he sees and goes directly to, smiling all the while like
       a rumpled idiot.

                           ADAM
                 I am so glad to see you!!  I thought
                 I'd never see you again!

                           EVE
                 Okay, down boy. (holds up the baseball
                 card) I can't take this for driving
                 you home. I wish I could, but I can't.
                 So here, take it back. I could have
                 just left it for you at the desk, but
                 it's very valuable. Now take it.

                           ADAM
                 I can't, it's yours.

                           EVE
                 Take it. damn it!

                           ADAM
                     (with hand over his mouth)
                 Okay.

       He takes the card.

                           EVE
                 Why are you doing that?

                           ADAM
                 I haven't brushed yet.

                           EVE
                 Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your
                 visit.


       She heads for the front door.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

                           EVE
                 Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

       EXT. HOTEL - DAY

       They exit.

                           EVE
                 I knew this would happen!  You're like
                 a lost puppy!

                           ADAM
                 Can't you please just talk to me for
                 one second?

                           EVE
                 Okay!  Damn!

       She stops, he stops.

                           EVE (CONT'D)
                 I should have taken the money and run!
                 That's what Troy told me to do!  But
                 do I listen?  No! Put your hand down!

       He does.

                           ADAM
                 Troy? Is he your husband? Or a
                 boyfriend?

                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                     (eyes to heaven)
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know
                 you like me.  I can tell. But you know
                 what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me,
                 exactly. It's more like the legs or
                 the butt or the hair.  Or some
                 combination of the above.

                           ADAM
                 I think it's the eyes.

                           EVE
                 The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow,
                 it never works out.  Okay?  Not that
                 you even need to know that!  You look
                 like crap, by the way.  What have you
                 been doing?

                           ADAM
                 Watching television in color.

                           EVE
                 Hey, no kidding?  In color?

                           ADAM
                 Cross my heart and hope to die.

       She looks at him for a beat or two, then abruptly turns
       away.

                           EVE
                 See, ya.

                           ADAM
                 Why doesn't it never work out?

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Why does it never work out?  You
                 and...men?

                           EVE
                 Why?!  Who the hell knows?!

       He follows closely. She stops.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Okay, if you promise to leave me
                 alone, I'll tell you.

                           ADAM
                 ...Okay.

                           EVE
                 It never works out because I'm into
                 legs and butts and hair myself!
                 That's why! So I wind up with guys who
                 are very good looking, but
                 even more shallow than I am, if you
                 can picture that.
                 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
                 find another low-paying, demeaning job
                 where some guy named Jerry keeps
                 telling me how lousy his marriage is.

                           ADAM
                 Why not go to work for me?

                           EVE
                 Doing what?

                           ADAM
                 Selling all my baseball cards.
                 And helping me buy enough food and
                 supplies to fill several large trucks.

                           EVE
                 Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like
                 starving people?


                           ADAM
                 Well, they're not starving yet, but
                 they need help.

                           EVE
                 How long would you need me?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 What's the pay?

                           ADAM
                 What's fair?

                           EVE
                 I've got to make at least a thousand a
                 week.

       He gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course
       is exactly like his father's.

                           ADAM
                 You got it!
                 Wait here while I change.

                           EVE
                 Sure.

       He walks back to the hotel.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 My career's finally taking off...

       EXT. MARINE WHOLESALE SUPPLY, MARINA DEL REY - DAY

       Heavy-duty BOAT BATTERIES are being loaded into a U-Haul
       truck.  The store MANAGER steps up to Eve who is
       watching. Adam appears in the bg, thanking and being nice
       to the MEN loading the truck. He looks mighty stupid in
       another one of his Dad's old outfits.

                           MANAGER
                 Why would someone need twenty yacht
                 batteries?

                           EVE
                 I just work for the guy.

                           MANAGER
                 And who does he work for?  The CIA?

                           EVE
                 Naw...it's some sort of charity
                 thing..I guess for starving people
                 with yachts.



       INT. PRICE CLUB - LATER SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam shop with two carts, both full of CASES OF
       DR. PEPPER.

                           EVE
                 Why not buy them milk or something--
                 instead of Dr. Pepper?

                           ADAM
                 They like Dr. Pepper.

                           EVE
                 Who are these people?

                           ADAM
                 My Mom and Dad.

                           EVE
                 Very funny, smart ass.

                           ADAM
                 Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need
                 all of this! This is swell!

       He goes over to a huge supply of Prince Albert.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 Swell? Run, Eve.  Run.

       EXT. LOADING DOCK - SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a year's
       supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck.

       EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - SAME DAY

       A crowd has gathered to watch Adam and Eve empty seven
       shopping carts full of non-perishable groceries.

       ANGLE - 5 MINUTES LATER

       Eve goes to get into the truck. Adam hurries by her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Wait!

                           EVE
                 What?

       He opens the door for her. She shakes her head and gets
       in.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - THAT NIGHT

       She drives the truck to a stop. He keeps the beat to the
       song on the AM radio. It's VolarÈ. Adam loves it. Eve
       hates it. They come to a stop and she snaps off the
       radio.


                           EVE
                 Well, another day, another dollar.
                     (then)
                 Stop staring at me!!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry.

       He gets out.

                           EVE
                 Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, you know. I was thinking...

                           EVE
                 Night!

       She pulls away.

                           ADAM
                 Night!

       EXT./INT. U-STORE-IT - NEXT DAY

       Adam drags the last 50-pound bag of flour into a self-
       storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he
       padlocks.

                           ADAM
                 We'll have to rent a refrigerated
                 truck for the beef and poultry.

                           EVE
                 It's your life.  And, by the way, it's
                 a dandy.

                           ADAM
                 I guess we'll need another locker.

                           EVE
                 No problem.  We'll just sell another
                 baseball card.

                           ADAM
                 You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? -
                 -  but, I'd just be lost without you.



                           EVE
                 Thank you.

                           ADAM
                 And, um ...I guess...
                 I guess you and I, uh...

                           EVE
                 Adam?  Don't even think about it.
                 Okay?
                 I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean,
                 but believe me, it would be meaner if
                 I didn't say it. Okay?

                           ADAM
                 Okay.

                           EVE
                 Now, let's take the truck back and get
                 something to eat.

       She hops in behind the wheel.  He (hurt) is a little
       slower getting in his side.

       EXT. FREEWAY - LATER, SAME DAY

       Traffic is moving about forty miles an hour.  Their truck
       is in one of the middle lanes.

       INT. U-HAUL - CONTINUOUS

       Adam screws up his guts and turns to her.

                           ADAM
                 There's something else I would like
                 you to help me with.

                           EVE
                 Name it.

                           ADAM
                 Well, this is going to sound a little
                 crazy.

                           EVE
                     (laughing)
                 Oh, I'm sure it will!

                           ADAM
                 Then forget it.

                           EVE
                 No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

                           ADAM
                 This is for me.

                           EVE
                 Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.


                           ADAM
                 Well... Okay. I would like you to help
                 me find a...wife.

                           EVE
                 A wife?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 What for?

                           ADAM
                 Because I want to get married.

                           EVE
                 Why?!

                           ADAM
                 I don't want to be alone.

                           EVE
                 You can be single and not alone.
                 Marriage bites!

                           ADAM
                 Bites what?

                           EVE
                 The big one!

                           ADAM
                 It does?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't know that.

                           EVE
                 Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced
                 sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and
                 dad.

                           ADAM
                 They're all divorced?

                           EVE
                 Everybody's divorced.

                           ADAM
                 It didn't used to be that way.

                           EVE
                 I wouldn't know.
                     (then)
                 What kind of wife are you looking for?

                           ADAM
                 One who's not a mutant.

                           EVE
                 No dogs, huh? Okay.

                           ADAM
                 And if possible, I'd like to marry
                 someone from Pasadena.

       She is speechless. Then:

                           EVE
                 When do you need her by?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 Well, I could probably get you laid in
                 two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant
                 wife from Pasadena...that could take
                 some
                 time.

                           ADAM
                 That's what I was afraid of.


       INT. DINER - LATER, SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve are in a booth. The WAITRESS approaches with
       sandwiches and drinks.

                           ADAM
                 What do you mean, you can get me laid?

       He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer.

                           EVE
                 Could we talk about that a little
                 later?

                           ADAM
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                     (sugary, to waitress)
                 Thank you.

       The amazed waitress leaves.  Adam automatically lowers
       his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the
       counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips
       them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam
       continues to pray. The guys shut up.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

       Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow.  It's in a
       pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  Her GEO
       FISHTAILS into the picture and comes to rest half in the
       street, half on the curb.  Adam is driving.

                           EVE
                 Get out!

                           ADAM
                 The engine is still running.

       She rips the keys out of the ignition.

                           EVE
                 Now, get out!!

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am!

                           EVE
                 Stop that ma'am crap!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry!

       They get out.

                           EVE
                 You almost got us killed!

                           ADAM
                 I told you I've never driven before!

                           EVE
                 Never drive again!

                           ADAM
                 You said it would be easy!

                           EVE
                 I was wrong!!

                           ADAM
                 Is this your house?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           ADAM
                 I like it.

       She storms off for the house where a YOUNG MAN is coming
       out the front door in a cut-off T-shirt and spandex
       exercise shorts.

                           EVE
                 Swell!


       EXT. PORCH

       CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes.
       He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.
       Eve and Adam come up the steps.

                           CLIFF
                 What are you bitching about now?

                           EVE
                 What are you doing here?

                           CLIFF
                 I forgot some of my stuff.

                           EVE
                 Your stuff?  Let me see that.

       She looks in the box.  Holds up a pair of old briefs.

                           EVE
                 You came back for these?

                           CLIFF
                 Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's
                 this interesting looking fellow?

                           EVE
                 This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.

                           ADAM
                     (offering hand)
                 How do you do?

                           CLIFF
                 I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?
                 		(eyeing Eve)
                 You doin' any good?

                           EVE
                 Go home, Cliff, wherever that might
                 be.

                           CLIFF
                 Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember
                 her?  The model who went to Harvard?
                 Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam.
                 Nice coat!

       Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.

                           ADAM
                 Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met
                 you, Cliff!
                 		(then to her)
                 May I ask you a question?

                           EVE
                 He's a former boyfriend. We lived
                 together for about six months.  And
                 yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind
                 of got a thing for him.
                     (entering the house)
                 That's what you wanted to know, isn't
                 it?

                           ADAM
                     (following)
                 Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff
                 likes to wear another man's
                 underpants.

                           EVE
                     (OC)
                 What?!

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker
       then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to
       the first.

       INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two
       sugar cubes.  Next she adds several dashes of bitters.
       TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of
       appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.


                           TROY
                     (sotto)
                 Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

                           EVE
                 I knew you'd like him.

                           TROY
                 Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think
                 about it!  The guy's got all this
                 easily negotiable property. He's
                 obviously setting something up very
                 big.  Like a self-sustaining island
                 off the coast of South America, for
                 instance. Or perhaps he's the head of
                 a cult that's doing weird things with
                 poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
                 worse.

       He rushes out with the tray.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the
       ceiling.

                           ADAM
                 You have very nice ceilings.

                           TROY
                 I do? Well, thank you! You like
                 ceilings?

                           ADAM
                 Not particularly.

                           TROY
                 Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea
                 urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"
                 if you prefer. I love sushi.

                           ADAM
                 I love Lucy!

                           TROY
                 You nut!

       Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines.

       .

                           EVE
                 Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 I thought only hookers drank those
                 things.

                           ADAM
                 Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

       Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his
       wine.

                           TROY
                 Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't
                 we sit and chat.

       They do.



                           TROY
                 So, Adam...where on earth are you
                 from?

                           EVE
                 Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

                           ADAM
                 It's a very small place. People don't
                 even know it's there.

                           TROY
                 And it's called...?

                           ADAM
                 Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

                           TROY
                 Really?  Since when?

                           EVE
                     (defensive)
                 Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
                 Springs.

                           TROY
                 Oh, yes.

                           EVE
                 I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

                           ADAM
                 Right on the button.

                           TROY
                 Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home
                 town.

                           EVE
                 Give me your hand.

                           TROY
                     (to himself)
                 Oh, my God...

       Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her
       finger slowly and gently around in his palm.  For her,
       it's psychic stuff.  For him, it's spine-tingling.

                           EVE
                 Okay, let's see...I'm not promising
                 anything. You okay?

                           ADAM
                 Um-hum.

                           EVE
                 I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow.
                 Way up North.  Are we getting hot?

                           ADAM
                 Yes!

                           EVE
                 You live in...Alaska.  The only way in
                 or out of your place is by plane
                 and... you've definitely come down
                 here for food and supplies and... to
                 find a wife!

                           ADAM
                 Wow.

       She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory
       gulp.

                           TROY
                 That's right?

                           ADAM
                     (to Eve)
                 I've never met anyone like you in my
                 life.

                           TROY
                 She's right?!

                           EVE
                 Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant.


                           ADAM
                 I've got goose-bumps all over me.

                           TROY
                 Why not just go to... Nome for
                 supplies and a wife?  Isn't that
                 closer?

                           EVE
                 Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to
                 find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the
                 way.

                           ADAM
                 Good for you.

                           TROY
                 Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask
                 you a few questions.  When did Alaska
                 become a state?

                           ADAM
                 1959.

                           TROY
                 Who use to own it?

                           ADAM
                 Russia.

                           TROY
                 When did we get it from them?

                           ADAM
                 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2
                 million dollars for it. A tidy sum
                 then, as well as now. I'm quoting my
                 father, of course.

                           TROY
                 What's the capitol?

                           ADAM
                 Juneau.

                           TROY
                 Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, that's the largest city.

       Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.

                           ADAM
                 Where's he gone?

                           EVE
                 He's gone to check your answers on his
                 computer.

                           ADAM
                 He has a computer?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 In the house?

                           EVE
                 No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of
                 course, in the house.  It's in there.

                           ADAM
                 May I please be excused?

                           EVE
                 Uh...yeah.

       TROY'S OFFICE

       He has "Alaska" on his computer screen.  Adam enters and
       looks at the computer, which captivates him.

                           ADAM
                 This must be very new.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 It's so small.

                           TROY
                 What are you talking about? This is
                 the new Mac. You a hacker?

                           ADAM
                 I don't think so.

                           TROY
                 You don't have a computer in your
                 cabin?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           TROY
                 How do you get through those winters?
                 		(reading screen)
                 Well, you're right.  Juneau.
                 		(then, covering the
                 		 screen with his hand)
                 What's the highest peak?

                           ADAM
                 Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest
                 point in North America.

                           TROY
                     (after peeking at the screen)
                 Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go
                 eat!

                           ADAM
                     (indicating computer)
                 That would knock my father out.

                           TROY
                 Yeah?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, yes.
                     (to himself)
                 It would probably kill him.

                           TROY
                 He's a Windows guy then, huh?

                           ADAM
                 Yes. He likes windows.

                           TROY
                 Well, I think Windows stink. What do
                 you think of that?

                           ADAM
                 ...I guess it's...just a matter of
                 personal taste.

                           TROY
                 True.

       Troy exits. Adam follows.


       (EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene
       134 rather than precede it.)








       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly.  Helen stands quietly
       at the door looking at him. She finishes off her
       champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.

       INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too
       much to drink.

       INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

       The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the
       red light.  Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up
       expectantly and anxiously.  Helen appears--and looks at
       this terribly odd assortment of people.

                           SODA JERK
                 Who are you?!

                           HELEN
                     (beat, then)
                 I'm the mother.

                           SODA JERK
                 It's the mother!!

       And they all fall down on their knees and worship her
       with much wailing and rejoicing.  Several speak in
       tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the
       button on the control box, and goes back down.


       INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT

       Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's
       and Troy's utter lack of same.

                           TROY
                 But first, you have to start with the
                 clothes!

                           EVE
                 Exactly.
                 		(then to Adam)
                 You understand that, don't you?  You
                 have no chance of meeting a woman
                 dressed like that.

                           ADAM
                 All right.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 So, what are you seeing?

                           TROY
                     (looking Adam over)
                 I don't know.

                           EVE
                 Money is no object.  He's got cards up
                 the wazoo.

                           ADAM
                 The what?

                           EVE
                 Wazoo!  Try to listen.
                     (then to Troy)
                 Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-
                 hop, Euro trash?

                           TROY
                 You're serious, aren't you?

                           EVE
                 What's that supposed to mean?

                           TROY
                 It means that your taste in men's
                 apparel is as bad as your taste in
                 men.

                           EVE
                 Well, that's blunt!

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

                           EVE
                 And I suppose you see him in some sort
                 of strapless  thing, don't you?

                           TROY
                 I see "elegant."

                           EVE
                 Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

                           TROY
                 That's what I'm sensing.

                           ADAM
                 The guy with the underpants!

                           EVE
                 That's boring!

                           TROY
                     (indicating Adam)
                 Not on him.

                           ADAM
                 I'm not wearing his pants.

                           TROY
                 Why not? He has great pants.

                           ADAM
                 I just don't want to.

                           TROY
                 Okay.

                           EVE

                 Why don't you take him and pick out
                 his clothes?

                           TROY
                 Alright, I will.

                           EVE
                     (talking with her mouth full)
                 I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to
                 buy six thousand paper napkins.

                           TROY
                 What do you think, Adam?

                           ADAM
                 About clothing?

                           EVE
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 Whatever you two want. If you've got
                 the time, I've got the wazoo.

       Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.

                           TROY
                 Isn't it a little tiring to sit up
                 straight like that?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           EVE
                 What about holding your right arm up
                 like that all the time?

                           ADAM
                 It's fine. Just give it a try.
                 And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot
                 off the chair!

       She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

       SCENE 136 OMITTED



       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY

       Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of
       packages. They head for the house.

                           ADAM
                 I guess a lot of those tall buildings
                 we saw this morning are new.

                           TROY
                 Almost all of them.

                           ADAM
                 The recovery is very impressive.

                           TROY
                 The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they
                 rebuilt the freeway in six months.

                           ADAM
                 Amazing. I'm very impressed.



       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY

       Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy
       enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks
       terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other
       packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,
       Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's
       makeover.

                           TROY
                 Well, what do you think?

                           EVE
                 I think...it...works.

                           TROY
                 Let me show you the entire trousseau!

                           ADAM
                 But first let me show her these!

       He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --
       a pair of rollerblades.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Eve, can I skate around your block?

                           TROY
                     (making it sexual)
                 How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around
                 your block?

                           EVE
                     (beat, then)
                 No.

       SCENE 138 OMITTED




       EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY

       There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach
       that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit
       at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all
       over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-
       shirt.



       The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted
       commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to
       the band shell.

       ANGLE - CLOSER

       of him skating and them watching.

                           EVE
                 He's going to kill himself.
                     (then, to Adam)
                 Go skate out on the bike path! It's
                 that way!

                           ADAM
                 Okay!

       He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he
       skates into an area that has been given over to the
       homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and
       blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He
       takes them to be more mutants.

       EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS

       Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty
       girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-
       builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.

       ANGLE - WAVES

       breaking on the beach and rocks.

       EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS

       Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like
       towards the waves.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       appear on a dune behind him and watch.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a
       Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf
       and dives.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

                           EVE
                 That water's freezing!

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

                           TROY
                 That's why little things mean so much
                 to him.

       ANGLE - ADAM

                           ADAM
                 I LOVE THIS!!

       Begin the record "YMCA" over this.

       INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY

       Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam
       goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a
       disapproving look.

                           TROY
                     (defensive)
                 What?! He wanted to hear some
                 standards!

       (My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge
       rebirth of popularity at their parties. Apparently they
       line dance to it.)

       EXT. FREEWAY - SAME DAY

       A helicopter shot follows the U-Haul in traffic.
       (Continue music.)

       EXT. SELF-STORAGE - SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve fill a second storage site. (Continue
       music.)

       EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, PUBLIC PARK  - DAY

       We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double
       play.

       ANGLE - TROY AND ADAM

       Cheering the play with other gay fans.

                           ADAM
                 I get it! I finally get it! You have
                 to see it to understand it!

       Music ends.



       INT. EVE'S KITCHEN - NEXT DAY (RAIN)

       She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her
       head. She exits the back door with an umbrella.

       EXT. EVE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

       Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the
       middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She
       holds the umbrella over her head.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Have you ever heard the saying, "He
                 hasn't got enough sense to come in out
                 of the rain?"

                           ADAM
                 Yep.
                     (then watching the rain hit
                      the palm of his hand)
                 You know, my father -- who is a
                 scientist -- says that everything is a
                 miracle. Everything. Until recently I
                 wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

                           EVE
                 Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still
                 want to go girl hunting tonight?

                           ADAM
                 I certainly do!

                           EVE
                 Okay. But you know, this business of
                 finding you a wife -- it's kind of
                 ridiculous, don't you think?

                           ADAM
                     (rising)
                 No it's not!

                           EVE
                 Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a
                 wife? I mean...

                           ADAM
                 Then just help me find a girlfriend!
                 That's all I ask.
                 I'll give you every single card I've
                 got left!

                           EVE
                 Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm
                 just somebody you can buy off! Listen,
                 let me tell you something--

                           ADAM
                     (taking her by the arms)
                 Would you do it just because you're my
                 friend? My very best friend.

                           EVE
                 Well...yeah. Okay.

       He hugs her.

                           ADAM
                 Thank Q, Eve!

       She's uncomfortable with the hug. Wait a minute. No she's
       not.

       EXT. "THE FORTIES" NIGHT CLUB - SAME NIGHT

       This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme.
       Establish the YOUTHFUL RICH arriving in their black four-
       wheel vehicles and silver Porsches. Coats and ties. Eve,
       Troy and Adam arrive on foot. Adam notices the valet
       parking.

                           ADAM
                 Why did you park way back there?

                           TROY
                 Miss Rustokov refuses to let total
                 strangers drive her car.

                           ADAM
                 Oh. I see.

       Eve looks like she owns the place.

       INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.

                           TROY
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

       Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND
       HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and
       Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.
       Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve
       notices them noticing.

                           ADAM
                 My goodness gracious!  This place is
                 something!

                           EVE
                 Look unimpressed.

                           TROY
                 Bored even.

       Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.

                           TROY
                 Vaguely bored!

       He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.

                           EVE
                 Unimpressed, but still interested.

       He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back
       and forth:  First interested, then not.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not crazy!

                           ADAM
                 Do I look crazy?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           TROY
                 Be loose.

       He overplays that.

                           EVE
                 Just be yourself.

                           TROY
                 Always good advice.

                           EVE
                 For him. It doesn't work for the rest
                 of us.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place
                 is neat-o!!

       Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.



       INT. MAIN ROOM

       There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with
       a DJ booth. The DJ is in a white dinner jacket and does a
       perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his
       speel between records.

       ANGLE - BAR

       JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy
       approaching. They ad-lib hellos. Here, and at the tables,
       the recorded MUSIC IS SO LOUD THEY MUST SPEAK OVER IT.

                           EVE
                 Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam,
                 that's them!

       They shake.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?! It's very nice to meet
                 you, Jason and Jonathan!
                     (confidentially, to them)
                 My mother always told me that if you
                 meet a person for the first time it's
                 easier to remember their names if you
                 use those names right away.

       Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska!

                           JASON/JONATHAN
                     (relieved)
                 Oh!

       A slightly drunk beauty named SOPHIE appears behind Eve.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?

       Eve hates Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Get lost, Sophie.

       Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi. I'm Sophie.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.

                           JASON
                 Adam lives in Alaska.

                           SOPHIE
                 No shit?

                           ADAM
                 Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon
                 accent.

                           SOPHIE
                 You speak beautiful French!
                 J'ai habitÈ a Paris un an.

                           ADAM
                 Paris!! La ville de lumieres!
                 C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour
                 pratiquer le francais.

                           SOPHIE
                 Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer
                 beaucoup des choses ensemble.


       Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from
       Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Quit showing off!  We're here on
                 business!

                           ADAM
                 Good-bye!

                           SOPHIE
                 Non, cherie. A bientot.

       Eve leads Adam to a table. Troy follows.

                           ADAM
                 I thought I was here to meet women.

                           EVE
                 Not that one!

                           ADAM
                 I like her.

                           EVE
                 And don't be so obvious!

       INT. TABLE - TEN MINUTES LATER

       Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks.
       It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a
       Rob Roy for Adam.

                           EVE
                 What have you ordered?

                           ADAM
                 It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink,
                 I'm told.

       ANGLE - LOVELY BRUNETTE

       slinking by.

       ANGLE - TABLE

                           ADAM (OC)
                 What about her?

                           EVE (OC)
                 No way.

                           ADAM
                 Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

                           EVE
                 Adam!  She's got bitch written all
                 over her!  You do know what "bitch"
                 means, don't you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't
                 understand for the life of me why you
                 would call her that!  Or why Cliff
                 would say that about you.

                           EVE
                 Because we're bitches!  Look at her!
                 Look at the expression on her face!
                 The walk, the jewelry, the
                 fingernails.  Please!

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout this one?

       "This one" is a KILLER BLOND.

                           EVE
                 Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even
                 be a crumb on her table!  You don't
                 see that?!

                           TROY
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's
                 nothing personal.

                           TROY
                 Adam,  I think for you, we should go
                 for "sweet."

                           ADAM
                 Okay. I like that.

                           EVE
                     (swigging her drink)
                 Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of
                 putting it.

                           ADAM
                     (to Troy)
                 What do I say to Miss Sweet when I
                 meet her?

                           TROY
                 Um... Eve?

                           EVE
                 It's not so much what you say but how
                 you say it.  Women like men who are
                 unpredictable.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           EVE
                 Yes, really! Basically, they want what
                 they think they can't have.  Same with
                 guys.  That's why everybody is walking
                 around here sending off "you can't
                 have me" signals!

       ANGLE OF MEN AND WOMEN

       doing precisely that. Then:

       BACK TO TABLE

                           ADAM
                 That's ridiculous.

                           EVE
                 Maybe. But that's how it works.

                           TROY
                 Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet."  At the
                 hors d'oeuvres table!

       INTERCUT - MISS SWEET

       She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face.

                           EVE
                 Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo.
                 Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

                           ADAM
                     (very serious)
                 Okay. All right.
                     (then)
                 And what do I say?

                           EVE
                 Say something surprising. And funny.
                 Lie, if need be.

                           TROY
                 Yes! Lying is always a very effective
                 dating tool.

                           ADAM
                 Okay. Thank you, my friends.

       Adam rises.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 By the way, that's a great play.

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

                           EVE
                 Did you?

       Adam nods and shoves off.

                           TROY
                 I'm not sure I want to watch this.

       Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still
       not  sure exactly why.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       crossing to Miss Sweet.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 Surprising and funny. Well, I know a
                 duck who bought some lip balm...

       INT. HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE

       Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers
       himself:

                           ADAM
       Hi!

                           MISS SWEET
                     (not sweet)
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 I was wondering if you might help me.
                 I...I seem to have lost my
                 Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere
                 around here.

       Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then
       chuckles.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Oh, now, that's a great one!

                           ADAM
                     (big smile)
                 You like it?

                           MISS SWEET
                     (a little clap)
                 Bravo!

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

       They both laugh.

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another
       pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS

       Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.

                           MISS SWEET
                 This is my new friend...

                           ADAM
                 I'm Adam Webber.

                           MISS SWEET
                 He's really funny!

                           HEATHER
                 Hi!  I'm Heather!

                           ADAM
                 "Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever
                 heard that name before.

       There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah, right!

                           MISS SWEET
                 I told you!  He's funny!

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching
       Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND HIS NEW FRIENDS

                           MISS SWEET
                 We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're
                 both professional dancers.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           HEATHER
                 You dance?

                           ADAM
                 I took a dance lesson everyday of my
                 life until a couple of days ago.

                           MISS SWEET
                 You're kidding!

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Your mom was a dancer?

                           ADAM
                 She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You
                 would like her very much! Shall we
                 dance?

                           MISS SWEET
                 Sure.


       They head for the dance floor.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

       ANGLE - THE FLOOR

       A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.



       He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but
       they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at
       picking up the new stuff she shows him.

       ANGLE - EVE & TROY

       They are shocked.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop
       to watch someone who is so much better than them. The
       three of them begin to dance together.

       ANGLE - TROY & EVE


                           TROY
                 You know, he's a very, very good--


                           EVE
                 Shut up!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR/ EVE

       Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK
       AND FORTH between them and Eve.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with
       great aplomb.  Other dancers applaud them. Someone is
       WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA.  Adam and his dance partners
       look over to:

       ANGLE - EVE

       She is whistling like a guy calling his dog.  Troy is
       embarrassed.

                           TROY
                 Must you...

       Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come
       over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the
       floor.

                           TROY
                 What in the hell is wrong with you?!!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

                           MISS SWEET
                 Is that your girl friend?

                           ADAM
                 No. Would you please excuse me?

                           HEATHER
                 If you'll please come back.

                           ADAM
                 I will certainly try.  And thank you
                 both very much for the dance.

       He leaves.

                           MISS SWEET
                 When was the last time you saw manners
                 like that?

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner
                 or something.

       ANGLE - TABLE

       as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 Go to the bathroom.

                           TROY
                 Right here?
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
                 sure!

       Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.

                           ADAM
                 You wanted to see me!

                           EVE
                 You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you
                 learn to dance like that?!  And there
                 are no starving people, are there?!

                           ADAM
                 Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

                           EVE
                 Don't change the subject! I want you
                 to tell me the truth about yourself.

                           ADAM
                 I've never lied to you.  I've maybe
                 let you believe things that you wanted
                 to believe, but I've never lied.

                           EVE
                 You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't
                 you?!

                           ADAM
                 No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love
                 with you the first time I saw you.
                     (off her look)
                 I did. I think that you are the most--

                           EVE
                 I want to know exactly who you are and
                 what you're really up to!

                           ADAM
                 All right. Let me tell you the whole
                 thing. In 1962--


                           CLIFF (OC)
                 Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up
                 nice?

       Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a
       gentleman, rises and offers his hand.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Cliff, how are you this
                 evening?

       Cliff barely shakes his hand.

                           CLIFF
                 Not bad.

       Then he sits in Adam's seat.

                           CLIFF
                 But I do miss that green sport coat of
                 yours.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you very much. But, Cliff,
                 that's my seat. And I was just--

                           CLIFF
                     (to Eve)
                 How 'bout a drink at the bar?

                           EVE
                     (pause, then)
                 Sure.

       They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.

                           CLIFF
                 It's all yours.

       Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He
       looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
       who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING
       GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
       Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then
       she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
       smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
       Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

       ANGLE - BAR

       Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.
       Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg.

       ANGLE - Troy

       returning from the restroom.  He is surprised to see Eve
       at the bar with Cliff.  When he looks back at the dance
       floor table, Adam is not there.

       ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF

       Sipping wine.

                           EVE
                 So where is your roommate, the model?

                           CLIFF
                 You know, I don't know.  And looking
                 at you, I don't care.  It's been too
                 long, Eve.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Please excuse this interruption.

                           CLIFF
                 Oh, brother...

       WIDER - BAR

       Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and
                 please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't
                 Cliff just a butt with hair?

                           CLIFF
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and
                 hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow,
                 as well?

                           CLIFF
                     (the shallowest guy in the
                      world)
                 Shallow? I'm shallow?!

                           EVE
                 Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

                           CLIFF
                 Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

       He gives Adam a shove.

                           ADAM
                 Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to
                 defend myself.

                           CLIFF
                 Do ya?

       Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
       counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
       snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,
       very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
       and Jonathan.

                           EVE
                 Stop it, you two!

                           CLIFF
                     (slightly insecure)
                 I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 Yes, I agree.

       Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick
       left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
       not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam
       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
       side.

                           EVE
                 Adam?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry.

                           CLIFF
                     (increasingly insecure)
                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
                 Fighting is pretty immature.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 It certainly is.  I agree with you
                 completely.

                           CLIFF
                 Eve? I'm leaving.

                           EVE
                 I don't blame you!

                           ADAM
                     (turning to Eve)
                 Eve, I'm sorry.

       Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
       right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
       short right jab.

                           CLIFF
                     (deeply insecure)
                 Well, good night, everyone.

       Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff
       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
       nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
       subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)

                           EVE
                 I'm leaving, too.

                           ADAM
                 But, Eve, I would--

                           EVE
                 And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
                 out--because I quit!  This is
                 ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
                 ridiculous!

       She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

       Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door.
       But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.

                           EVE
                 He go back to the hotel?

                           TROY
                 Uh..he might of.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters. She slams the door.

                           EVE
                 What's that mean?

                           TROY
                 We did not leave together.

                           EVE
                 Who did he leave with?


                           TROY
                 What's it to you?!

                           EVE
                 I'm his pimp. He left with the
                 dancers, didn't he?

                           TROY
                 Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the
                 psychic pimp.  You tell me.

                           EVE
                 Those sluts!

                           TROY
                 Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?


       He enters the kitchen

       INT. KITCHEN

       She follows him: He gets something to drink.

       .

                           EVE
                  Where are you going?

                           TROY
                 To bed.

                           EVE
                 To bed?

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love
                 with the guy.

                           EVE
                 What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn
                 minute!

       Troy exits into his office.


       INT. OFFICE

       He plops down on the chair.

       .

                           EVE
                 In the first place, I don't fall in
                 love with weirdos I've only known for
                 four or five days.

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 And I don't fall in love with grown
                 men who collect baseball cards!!

                           TROY
                 Uh, yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 Or pee in their pants when they see
                 the ocean!

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do!

                           EVE
                 Or have perfect table manners.

                           TROY
                     (sitting up)
                 You know, I asked him about that. And
                 he said that good manners are a way we
                 have of showing other people that we
                 respect them. See, you'd eat like a
                 slob if you
                 were alone, but since another human
                 being is present, you show that person
                 respect by going to the trouble of
                 having proper manners. I didn't know
                 that. I thought it was a way of
                 appearing superior.
                     (then)
                 Know what else he told me?

                           EVE
                     (sitting on the bed)
                 What?

                           TROY
                 He thinks that I am a gentleman and
                 that you are a lady!

                           EVE
                 Well, consider the source. I don't
                 even know what a lady is.

                           TROY
                 Exactly! I thought a gentleman was
                 somebody who owned horses. Turns out,
                 the short and very simple definition
                 of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
                 who always attempts to make the people
                 around him or her feel as comfortable
                 as possible. That's it! If you don't
                 do that, nothing else matters. The
                 cars, the clothes, the houses...

                           EVE
                 Where did he get all that information?

                           TROY
                 From the oddest place. His parent's
                 told him. I don't think I got that
                 memo.

                           EVE
                 So now I suppose he's trying to make
                 those two dancers feel as comfortable
                 as possible.

                           TROY
                 He didn't leave with them.

                           EVE
                 Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear
                 that.

                           TROY
                 He left with Sophie.

                           EVE
                 What?!!

                           TROY
                 It's true.  She swept him out the door
                 whispering little French things into
                 his ear.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please
                 don't tell me that!!


                           TROY
                 What are you going to do? Go over to
                 her place and kick in the door?

                           EVE
                 You're goddamn right I am!

       She exits, then sticks her hand back in.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 You coming?!

                           TROY
                     (cringing)
                 I don't think so.

                           EVE
                 Coward!

       She exits.

                           TROY
                 Gentleman coward, to you.

       SCENE 148 OMITTED



       EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide
       open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,
       and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual
       fumbling.

                           EVE
                 Come on!  Come on, damn it!

       INT. CAR

       She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam
       appears at the passenger window.

                           ADAM
                 Hi!

       Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and
       jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting
       her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her
       feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.

                           ADAM
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You
                 stupid son of a bitch!!!

                           ADAM
                 I'm really sorry!

                           EVE
                 What in the hell are you doing here!!
                 You're supposed to be over on San
                 Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex
                 with that slut Sophie!!

                           ADAM
                 I know...and I'm really sorry.

                           EVE
                 Well, you should be!  Thanks to you,
                 my heart is in my neck!

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Goodnight!

       Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

                           EVE
                 Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is
                 that?!  What if this is for life?!

                           ADAM
                 I know first aid!

                           EVE
                 Well, you had better!!

       He chases her up the porch steps.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

       Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the
       abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat
       pants.

                           EVE
                 Wait a minute.

       She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,
       revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.

                           EVE
                 There.

                           ADAM
                 Thanks.

       He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the
       antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she
       flinches.

                           ADAM
                 Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all
                 right in no time.

       He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of
       his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,
       watching as he blows gently on her knee.

                           ADAM
                 I went to Sophie's and she was very
                 hospitable.

                           EVE
                 Is that what you call it?

                           ADAM
                 But it just wasn't where I wanted to
                 be so I left as politely as I could
                 and found a taxi.  But I asked the
                 driver to drop me here instead of at
                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como
                 sings called "On the Street Where You
                 Live."  You know it?

                           EVE
                 Sing it to me.

                           ADAM
                     (softly, saying it as much as
                      singing it)
                 "All at once am I--several stories
                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
                 where you live."  It's about a young
                 man who is overjoyed just to be
                 standing in front of the house of the
                 person he loves.

       She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws
       him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.
       Then:

                           EVE
                 Adam...dumb question, but humor me.
                 Have you ever had sex before?

                           ADAM
                 No.


       She sits up.

                           EVE
                 How is that possible?

       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is
       mental.

                           ADAM
                     (sitting up)
                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our
                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was
                 born. We
                 only survived because it was a huge
                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My
                 father worked on it secretly for
                 years. When he had to, he used
                 contractors, but always from out-of-
                 state and always for just a portion of
                 the job. He told them it was a secret
                 government experiment done through
                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of
                 course, it had to be a secret, because
                 we had just enough supplies to last
                 three people thirty-five years. That's
                 also why I have no brothers or
                 sisters. The air vent was the really
                 tricky part, but he was able to cut
                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd
                 like to do Eve, is take you down into
                 the fallout shelter with me. We could
                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
                 said if I found a healthy girl I
                 should "bring her on down". And you
                 look plenty healthy to me.


                           EVE
                 Uh-huh. Adam?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, Eve?

                           EVE
                 I want you to go back to the hotel
                 now.  I'll call you a cab.

                           ADAM
                 Of course.  I shouldn't be over here
                 at this hour.

       He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.

                           EVE
                 That's right.  And I'll see you in the
                 morning in the lobby.  Do you mind
                 waiting outside for the taxi?

                           ADAM
                 Not at all.  And Eve thank you for
                 tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

                           EVE
                 My pleasure.

                           ADAM
                 It was at least as good as the sky.

                           EVE
                 Really?  Okay!

                           ADAM
                 And I think better than the ocean. I'm
                 serious!

                           EVE
                 Neat. Goodnight!

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks
       heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.


       Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front
       door.

       EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY

       A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.

       INT. TRUCK

       Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his
       driving skills.

                           TROY
                 Goddamn, Adam!


                           ADAM
                 Wait a minute!

       He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in
                 vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.

                           ADAM
                 No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back
                 there!  I'll be right back!

       Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.

                           TROY
                 Without question, the strangest man
                 I've ever met.

       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs
       to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next
       store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries
       the front door and at first it does not open.

       INT. MALT SHOP

       The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in
       prayers.

                           SODA JERK
                 Give us a sign!  That's all we ask!
                 Give us some sort of sign!

       The front door opens and Adam peers in.  He sees the Soda
       Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves.  Then he closes
       the
       door.  The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints.  His
       followers rush to his aid.

       INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam jumps in.

                           ADAM
                 Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef
                 frozen patties!

                           TROY
                 How 'bout we check with Eve first?

                           ADAM
                 You bet!

                           TROY
                 So, did you buy a movie?

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           TROY
                 A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the
                 bookstore.

                           ADAM
                     (concentrating on his
                      driving)
                 No, I wouldn't go in one of those
                 places with a gas mask on.

                           TROY
                     (laughing in agreement)
                 I know what you mean!  I usually wear
                 a big hat and dark glasses.

                           ADAM
                 Does that work?

                           TROY
                 Yeah...Seems to.

       Adam would not have thought that.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the
       deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind
       looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.

                           ADAM
                 Hi, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

                           ARON
                 I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?

                           ARON
                 Very well, thank you. I'm with the
                 County Family Services Department. Eve
                 tells me you've been living in a bomb
                 shelter most of your life.

                           ADAM
                 Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

                           ARON
                 Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my
                 associate -- Mr. Brown.

       BROWN appears from the kitchen.  He's good-sized man who
       dresses casually.  Adam becomes uneasy.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

       He nods politely.

                           ARON
                 We want you to come with us so we can
                 talk some more about your experiences.

                           ADAM
                 Come where?

                           ARON
                 My office.

                           ADAM
                 For how long?

                           ARON
                 Well, that depends...

                           ADAM
                 I thank you very much for the
                 invitation, but I'm quite busy today.
                 Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

                           EVE
                 Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.
                 It's the best thing.  The best thing
                 for you. I promise.

                           ADAM
                 ...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

                           EVE
                 ...I do.

                           ADAM
                     (to Aron)
                 Could I please just go home?  I was
                 lost, but this morning I found home
                 and I promise not to bother any of you
                 ever again.

                           ARON
                 Let's go talk first, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.



       The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons
       for Adam to step out.

                           TROY
                 Good-bye, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Goodbye.

       Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.

                           ARON
                     (to Eve)
                 You'll be hearing from me.

       She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.

                           EVE
                 Well what was I supposed to do?! He
                 wants me to live underground with him!
                 That's like Silence of the Lambs,
                 don't you think?!

                           TROY
                 I know...I know. You did the right
                 thing.

       Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK
       FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no!

                           TROY
                 What?!

       She runs out.  He follows.

       EXT. STREET

       Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs
       between houses.  Brown is not as fast.

       EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD

       Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell
       phone.

                           EVE
                 Oh, my God!

                           ARON
                 He'll catch him.
                 		(then into phone)
                 Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run
                 away and I'm going to need police
                 assistance.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

                           ARON
                 I have to. If a complaint is made and
                 the person resists obser--

                           EVE
                 No, I can't have that! They'll come
                 with their cars and their guns and
                 their handcuffs--

                           ARON
                 Calm down, please. This man needs help
                 and you need protection from him.
                 That's obvious.

                           EVE
                 You know, I don't think so. I'm
                 confused but you know, I don't think
                 he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd
                 hurt anyone.

                           ARON
                 And now you must let me be the judge
                 of that!

                           EVE
                 I was frightened and I didn't know
                 what to think! But you know-I believe
                 him. I think he just wants to go home.
                 Wherever the hell that is...

                           ARON
                 Let's all remain calm. That's the key
                 thing.





       Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,
       startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.


                           ADAM
                 The key to my hotel room!  I want you
                 to have my baseball cards!
                 		(running to the truck)
                 And please be sure to pay my bill!

                           ARON
                 Young man, stop right there!

       Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.






       Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.

                           ARON
                 Stop, right now! Get out of that
                 truck!

                           TROY
                 Adam, you really shouldn't try to
                 drive that truck!

                           ADAM
                     (starting the engine)
                 Bye, Troy!

                           TROY
                 Bye, Adam!

                           ADAM
                 And thanks for always being happy!

                           TROY
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Gay.

                           TROY
                 Oh.
                 		(yelling to Adam)
                 Well, you're...certainly welcome!

       Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the
       driveway and into a parked car.

                           ARON
                 Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a
                 bitch!!

       Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the
       sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto
       the street.  He clips two parked cars as he does.  Brown
       comes running from the side of the house.  His pants are
       torn.

                           ARON (cont'd)
                 Where the hell have you been?!

                           BROWN
                 I fell down!
                     (to Troy and Eve)
                 What's the license number of that
                 truck?!

                           ARON
                 Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up
                 as the other guy!

                           TROY
                 Let's all just try to remain calm.
                 That's the key thing.

                           ARON
                 How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
                 you?!

       Brown has to grab her.

       EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY

       Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker
       doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried
       off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.

                           TROY
                 I guess he took what he could.



                           EVE
                     (putting her head in her
                      hand)
                 Good God...you don't think there
                 really is a bomb shelter, do you?

                           TROY
                 Fallout shelter.

       She gives him a look.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                 There's a difference.

       INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY

       Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin
       reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The
       distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their
       attention.  Then:

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home!

       They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam
       halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before
       noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.

                           ADAM
                 I've got almost everything we need!
                 And this nice man...

                           SODA JERK
                 Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

       He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.

                           ADAM
                 ...and his church group have
                 volunteered to help us bring the
                 supplies down.  But we've got to
                 hurry.

                           HELEN
                 Are you in trouble, son?!

                           ADAM
                 I think I'm being chased by a
                 psychiatrist.

                           HELEN
                 A psychiatrist?!

                           SODA JERK
                 It happens.

                           HELEN
                 My goodness! How bad is it up there?!

                           SODA JERK
                 Horrible.

                           CALVIN
                 You have something on your forehead.

                           SODA JERK
                 I know.

       INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

       Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees
       how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices
       "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page
       marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes
       out the cigar box.

                           TROY
                 This it?

       Eve nods.

                           TROY
                 What do you want to do with it?

                           EVE
                 Give it back to him.

                           TROY
                 And if we can't find him?

                           EVE
                 We'll find him.

       INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM

       Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;
       how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth
       paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the
       bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It
       makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and
       holds it as if it were his ring.

                           TROY (OC)
                 Hey, Eve?  Eve?

       He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's
       very close to crying.

                           TROY
                 What's wrong?

                           EVE
                 I don't know.  Everything's so neat.
                 It's all just so...goddamn dear.
                 		(starting to cry)
                 Damn!

                           TROY
                 See these?  Found them in the box with
                 the cards.  These are stock
                 certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.

       Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the
       toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                     (looking at the toothpaste)
                 Ipana. I think I remember that brand.
                     (then)
                 Oh, here, you should read this.
                 "Trademark, 1961."

       He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.


       EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly
       unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of
       the malt shop.

       INT. JASON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

       Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.

                           JASON
                 Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten
                 thousand shares of each?  They'd be
                 worth millions. Hell, I don't
                 know...millions upon millions upon
                 millions!  How 'bout that?

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING

       Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the
       stock certificates.

                           TROY
                 Thanks, Jason.

       He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.

                           TROY
                 Millions upon millions upon millions!
                 The cards. The stock!  The clothes!
                 The toothpaste!  The guy was on the
                 level!  And you blew it!  A man walks
                 into your life who is the kindest,
                 most polite, honest, trustworthy,
                 incredibly rich guy you have ever met
                 in your life!! And what do you do?!

                           EVE
                 Have him committed.

                           TROY
                 Yeah! That's thinking.

                           EVE
                 He was always so "nice"! How was I
                 supposed to know that's a good thing?!
                 "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is
                 "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you
                 that.
                     (beat, then)
                 Was it ever?

                           TROY
                 I don't know. I like to think so.

                           EVE
                 Well, at least I fell for him before I
                 found out he was rich! That's new.
                     (then)
                 Wait a minute! He said today he knew
                 where home was. What happened this
                 morning?! Where did you go?!

                           TROY
                 To get some frozen poultry.

                           EVE
                 Then what?

                           TROY
                 We came back to the house!

                           EVE
                 You didn't stop anywhere else?!

                           TROY
                 No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a
                 porno store.

                           EVE
                 What?!

                           TROY
                 An adult bookstore. He was very
                 excited about seeing it. You think
                 home is under a dirty bookstore in the
                 Valley?

                           EVE
                 Come on.

       She heads out.

                           TROY
                 Trendy address.

       They exit.


       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       Troy and Eve approach and enter.



       INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.
       There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot
       on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is
       solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their
       feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and
       two customers become concerned.

                           EVE
                     (to Pakistani)
                 Have you got a basement?

                           PAKISTANI
                     (indicating merchandise)
                 Believe me, all the really good stuff
                 is right here.

                           EVE
                 Is there a back entrance?

                           PAKISTANI
                 Are you kidding?  Of course.

       He points to the rear of the store.

       EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

       The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the
       lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and
       Eve appear after the truck is gone.

                           EVE
                 Why would you put a fallout shelter
                 under a porno shop?

                           TROY
                 None of this stuff was here in 1962.
                 The Valley was mostly small homes and
                 fruit orchards.

                           EVE
                 Well, we've come a long way, haven't
                 we?  I want to go home.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

       They turn left to get back to the avenue.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       The phone is ringing.  Then the recorder answers.

                           TROY
                 Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a
                 message. And if you want to leave a
                 number don't say it fast! I hate that!
                 Say it slow. Thank you.

       Beep,

                           ADAM
                 Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just
                 wanted to thank you for everything you
                 did for me...and I wanted to tell you
                 that I...uh...that I wish so many good
                 things for you. I wish so hard that
                 all of your dreams come true. Um...I,
                 uh...



       EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT

       Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and
       rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the
       curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them
       on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the
       bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt
       shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at
       passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just
       used.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

                           TROY
                 Where?!

                           EVE
                 Stop!

       She rolls down her window.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.

       ANGLE - EVE

       Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street
       and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,
       Troy is there to retrieve everything.

       In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race
       into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the
       lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like
       Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to
       kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so
       aggressive.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the
       locks with a screwdriver.

                           HELEN
                 How long will you set it for this
                 time?

                           CALVIN
                 I thought ten years.

                           HELEN
                 Well, that's...considerably shorter
                 than before.  I was wondering, Calvin,
                 why set the locks at all.  I mean the
                 radiation is gone and...

                           CALVIN
                 To keep what's up there from getting
                 down here! It's not the radiation I'm
                 worried about.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?  Dad?

       They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.

                           ADAM
                 I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
                 Rustokov.

       Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he
       chooses not to pursue it.

                           EVE
                     (stepping forward, offering
                      her hand)
                 How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr.
                 Webber?

                           WEBBERS
                     (rather dumb-struck)
                 Hello.

                            EVE
                 Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful
                 things about you.

                           HELEN
                 Well, please excuse us!  We...we
                 haven't entertained a guest in...um...

                           CALVIN
                 Some time.

                           HELEN
                 What can I offer you, Eve?

                           ADAM
                 Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

                           HELEN
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 I can't explain it now.  But I want
                 you to set the locks for two months.
                 You have more than enough of
                 everything.  Then we'll be back to get
                 you.

                           CALVIN
                 But, I don't understand.

                           ADAM
                 And, I'm asking you to trust me
                 without understanding why.

                           CALVIN
                 Well, in that case...of course, son.

                           HELEN
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                 They are wonderful parents.

                           ADAM
                 We have to go.

                           HELEN
                 No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, please! You must.

                           ADAM/EVE
                 Well...sure...okay.

       INT. BAR - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
       1962. Adam is with him.

       INT. - KITCHEN

       Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting
       the roast ready. Eve. watches.

                           EVE
                 Adam said I shouldn't mention the
                 Communists.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the
                 Communists!

       INT. - DINING ROOM

       Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The
       others are already there.

                           HELEN
                 Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but
                 are you and Adam...um...dating?

                           EVE
                 Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.
                     (then)
                 I'm also from Pasadena.

       Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He
       raises his tea cup.

                           CALVIN
                 A toast! To Adam and Eve!

       The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.
       Then they drink.

                           EVE
                     (gagging)
                 What is this sh...stuff?!

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know
                 how good it is heated up.

                           EVE
                 You know, they don't, do they?

       They begin to eat.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 What about grace?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!
                     (then)
                 I like your friend, Adam.

       They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads
       them.

                           EVE (VO)
                 And you thought your parents were
                 weird.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF LA - MORNING

       Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker
       unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve
       step onto the property. The broker's Lexus is in the b.g.

                           BROKER
                 It's like the Garden of Eden, don't
                 you think?

       Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's
       narration.

                           EVE (VO)
                 You see, that night, Adam had a choice
                 between me and his parents.







       SCENE 173 OMITTED

       EXT. VALLEY PROPERTY - DAY

       Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND
       CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans
       and are discussing dimensions.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It's truly amazing what you can get
                 done when you have unlimited funds.
                 Did you know you can have whole houses
                 built in just a matter of months. All
                 you have to say is this..."I don't
                 care what it costs."  And then, of
                 course, you've got
                 to really mean it, which no one ever
                 does.

       EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

       It is under construction.


       EXT. MELROSE RETRO FURNITURE STORE - DAY

       Adam, Eve and Troy enter.

       INT. RETRO STORE

       This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.
       Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with.
       There's a
       lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or
       something) from the Webber living room.

                           ADAM
                 That lamp is perfect!

                           STORE OWNER
                     (very faggy)
                 I'm holding that for Elton John.

                           TROY
                     (faggy right back)
                 Oh, I think not.

       SCENE 176 OMITTED  (REFER TO SCENE 172D)



       EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MALT SHOP (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

       Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards
       and the street people look on.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I've got to go back! My parents
                 can't handle this up here. And there
                 was no bomb, was there?



                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 See! I can't tell them that!  I can't
                 ever let them know. It makes their
                 life..well, frankly...
                 a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You
                 understand?

                           EVE
                 We can make this work, Adam! Believe
                 me! I'm very good at making things
                 work!

                           ADAM
                 My mother's like that.

       They kiss again.



       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY

       Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda
       Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up
       with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."
       There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar
       have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet
       Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests
       boarding the elevator.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It took a while to convince Archbishop
                 Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he
                 was pretty broken up about it, too,
                 until I showed him my plans for Los
                 Angeles' hottest and most original
                 night spot.

       Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and
       guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.

                           EVE
                 You'll be a ten percent partner and
                 still retain ownership of the
                 entrance.

                           SODA JERK
                 Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real
                 one.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER

       A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through
       automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE
       ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives
       the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
                 up to the surface very slowly.  Make
                 them very comfortable and then break
                 the bad news to them that there was no
                 nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't
                 kill them Adam's going to tell his
                 father about the Internet.

       EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY

       The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go
       bonkers when they see the house.





       INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       The parents enter first. They are thrilled, shocked, etc.

       INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

       As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from
       the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new
       device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the
       machine to investigate its workings.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve
       look on.

                           ADAM
                 You put the tape in here and you get a
                 movie -- in your own home.

       We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on
       the screen. Troy and Eve rush forward.

                           EVE/TROY
                 No!!

       INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       It has been turned into an office for Calvin.

                           HELEN
                 This is your bedroom?

                           ADAM
                 No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's
                 office.

                           HELEN
                 Well, where are you --

                           ADAM
                 Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 Is that all right?

                           HELEN
                 It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!

       They hug.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Calvin!  They're married!

                           CALVIN
                     (offering his hand to both)
                 That's wonderful. We Webber guys have
                 mighty good luck when it comes to
                 women.

       Calvin points out the computer.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 What's that thing?

                           ADAM
                 It's kind of a combination television-
                 typewriter-telephone-post office type
                 of thing.
                     (leading Calvin out)
                 I'll show it to you later.

       EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves
       and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern
       construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)

                           CALVIN
                 This is great son, just great. By the
                 way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
                 that's not Russian, is it?

                           ADAM
                 It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
                 immigrated here.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

                           ADAM
                 Dad, I don't know how to tell you
                 this. And I was going to wait a while,
                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I
                 looked it up in old newspapers.

                           CALVIN
                     (after a while)
                 You're sure?

                           ADAM
                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed
                 without a shot being fired. The Cold
                 War is over.

                           CALVIN
                 That's what everybody believes?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir. It's true.

                           CALVIN
                 What? Did the politburo just one day
                 say - "We give up?"

                           ADAM
                 Yes. That's kind of how it was.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

       Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
       catch it.

                           CALVIN
                 My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
                 You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we
                 didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our
                 evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor
                 us!"  I bet they've even asked the
                 West for aid!  Right?!

                           ADAM
                 Uh, I think they have.

                           CALVIN
                 Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
                 dissemblers! Those, uh...
                     (he can't think of another
                      description, so he moves on)
                 They've finally pulled the wool over
                 everybody's eyes!

                           EVE (VO)
                 Have you ever in your life seen a son
                 who did more for his parents?

       Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Adam says that this is simply how
                 things work.  First the parents take
                 care of the children and then the
                 children take care
                 of the parents. He says historically,
                 that's how it works.

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen
       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Whenever Adam gives me such obviously
                 incorrect information, I just smile,
                 slap him on the knee, and look out the
                 window.
                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such
                 wonderful dreams.

       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass
       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the
       dimensions for a fallout shelter.

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.
       Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".

                                                          FADE OUT:

                           THE END
FADE IN:



       SCENE 1 OMITTED

       EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - NIGHT

       OPEN on a MOVING WIDE SHOT of a mountain range with the
       distant lights of the San Fernando Valley behind it.
       BEGIN CREDITS as a NAVY JET drops down into the picture.
       PUSH IN on the jet's exhaust flame. Have the words "THE
       BLAST" come out of the flame. Then there is a SLIGHT
       EXPLOSION and the flame intensifies. The words "FROM THE
       PAST" jump out of the exhaust as the jet momentarily
       shakes.

       INT. JET

       The PILOT feels the jet shake. But he looks at his
       indicators and everything appears to be normal. He
       relaxes.

       EXT. JET

       We begin with a WIDER REAR SHOT of the jet and allow the
       plane to move away. Then SUPER: "LOS ANGELES, 1962"
       before continuing the main titles. A popular recording
       from that period has been playing throughout.

       EXT. CALVIN'S WORK SHOP - NIGHT

       Start on a CU of the HAM RADIO ANTENNA, WIND GAUGE and
       THERMOMETER attached to the roof of Calvin's shop. (We
       can hear military air traffic chatter on Calvin's
       Hallicrafter radio.) Then move down to the window where
       we see CALVIN Webber tinkering with a gadget at his work
       bench. Calvin's very pregnant wife HELEN appears. The
       music becomes source.

                           HELEN
                 For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got
                 guests!

                           CALVIN
                 Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling
                 with this darn rheostat.

                           HELEN
                 Well, put it down and come in!

                           CALVIN
                 You bet, hon!

       They exit the workshop for the house.  Calvin has left
       the ham radio on.




                           NAVY PILOT (ON
                           RADIO)
                 Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the
                 overhead.

                           TOWER (ON RADIO)
                 Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers.
                 You're number one for the overhead.

                           NAVY PILOT (ON
                           RADIO)
                 Wolf one.


       INT. COCKPIT OF JET - SAME TIME

       The YOUNG PILOT looks down at the flashing red light on
       his control panel. He speaks into the oxygen mask that
       hangs loosely from his helmet.

                           PILOT
                 Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem
                 here.

                           TOWER (OC)
                 Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you
                 declaring an emergency?

                           PILOT
                 Stand by. One.

       INT. DINING ROOM

       DAVE, BETTY, BOB, and RUTH (30's) pass around the buffet
       table. Another period song is playing on the phonograph.

                           BETTY
                 Just remember: don't mention the
                 communists!

                           DAVE
                 Calvin's a great guy, but he's a
                 little, you know...

                           BETTY
                 Nutty.

                           RUTH
                 What's his wife like?

                           BETTY
                 Oh, you know, housewife.

                           DAVE
                 Likes to cook. Pregnant.

                           RUTH
                 Normal, then.

                           BETTY
                 Well, I wouldn't go that far.
                     (then)
                 Helen!

       Helen has entered from the kitchen with more food. She
       favors June Allison.

                           HELEN
                 Hi, Betty!  Dave!

                           BETTY
                 Just look at you!

                           HELEN
                 Any day now!

                           BETTY
                 This is my sister and her husband.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, hi! Welcome!

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Calvin is using a cocktail shaker to very carefully make
       Rob Roys for the crowd at the bar. It's like watching a
       chemist at work. Calvin's a pipe-smoker.

                           CALVIN
                 So anyhow this duck says to the clerk,
                 "I'd like to buy this lip balm."  And
                 the clerk says, "Will that be cash or
                 a check?"  And the duck says, "Just
                 put it on my bill!"

       Polite laughter follows, but the guy out of Calvin's
       sight-line rolls his eyes.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       with drinks. Helen is in the b.g., rushing around, over-
       serving everyone.

                           DAVE
                 He was the golden-boy professor at Cal
                 Tech.  But then he starts inventing
                 things.

                           BOB
                 What kind of things?

                           DAVE
                 You got me.  Some kind of special
                 synthetic rubber.  And some kind of
                 automated machine.  Anyhow, suddenly
                 he gets rich.  I mean rich!  And quits
                 teaching.

       ANGLE - CALVIN

       as his guests sample their Rob Roys.

                           CALVIN
                 How's that?

                           GUEST
                 Just what the doctor ordered!

       Calvin gives the man his patented thumbs-up sign.

       ANGLE - BETTY AND RUTH

       over by the patio doors. We can see Calvin's shop through
       the window.

                           BETTY
                 With all his money they could have
                 moved to Beverly Hills, but they
                 decided to stay in the Valley.  Calvin
                 spends all his time tinkering out
                 there in his workshop.  If you ask me
                 it's all very strange.

                           WOMAN GUEST #1
                     (chiming in)
                 He dug a huge hole out there for a
                 swimming pool. Then he decided he
                 didn't want it and filled the thing
                 in. And what's that big, high fence
                 for?

       The women look at Calvin.



       ANGLE - CALVIN

       with guests (one is called Harold) at the bar.

                           CALVIN
                 There currently exists a type of neon
                 light that lasts five years.  But you
                 won't see it on the market. Same is
                 true of batteries. I could take your
                 simple yacht battery and rig it to
                 last a decade, easily.

                           HAROLD
                 Well, what the heck kind of a
                 marketing system can't get great new
                 products like that out to the public?

                           CALVIN
                     (intense)
                 A veeeery good one, Harold. Free
                 market capitalism may not be a perfect
                 order, but it's the best we've got, or
                 will ever have.  And why?  Three
                 reasons!

       Poor Harold.

       INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Most of the guests are women, gabbing and helping Helen
       out as she removes a pot roast from the oven and busily
       jumps around the kitchen.

                           WOMAN GUEST #2
                 Say, Helen?  What does Calvin think
                 about this trouble down in Cuba?

                           HELEN
                     (rolling her eyes)
                 Oh, please don't bring that up!

       EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT, MOMENTS LATER

       A late guest named RON hurries up the walkway and into
       the house.





       SCENE 8 OMITTED

       INT. LIVING ROOM - A SECOND LATER

       Calvin is with another guest.

                           CALVIN
                 I'd say my baseball card collection is
                 as complete as any one I've ever seen.

       Ron pushes his way through the crowd.

                           RON
                 Calvin!  Hey, Calvin!
                 		(pointing over his shoulder)
                 Kennedy's going toe-to-toe with
                 Khrushchev on the television!

       Calvin immediately heads for the family room. Others
       follow.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Everyone is huddled around the JFK TV press conference.
       There seems to be a lot of smokers. Helen appears
       shortly, wearing a hot pad mitten on each hand.

                           JFK
                 ...this sudden, clandestine decision
                 to station strategic weapons for the
                 first time outside of Soviet soil, is
                 a deliberately provocative and
                 unjustified change in the status quo
                 which cannot be accepted by this
                 country.

       Calvin cuts a knowing look at Helen who dutifully returns
       it.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       The plane swoops over the Valley and we see the
       spectacular lights of L.A. sprawl.  There is a TRAIL OF
       SPARKS coming from the jet's engine.

       INT. JET COCKPIT

       The plane is shaking terribly and the pilot is having a
       very hard time controlling it.

                           TOWER
                 Wolf One -- say intentions.

                           PILOT
                 I've got secondaries of an engine fire
                 and I'll need to find a clear area to
                 eject.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to
                 the ocean?

       EXT. JET

       The trembling plane circles to the west.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM

       Return to TV.

                           JFK
                 ...we will not prematurely or
                 unnecessarily risk the cost of
                 worldwide nuclear war, in which even
                 the fruits of victory would be ashes
                 in our mouth.  But neither will we
                 shrink from the risk at any time it
                 must be faced.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT/ EXT. HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER

       To Helen's embarrassment, Calvin is ushering  all the
       guests to the front door. Helen is passing out hats and
       purses. She and Calvin speak simultaneously - somewhere
       in the middle we cut outside.


                           CALVIN
                 I'm sorry everyone, but given this
                 extraordinary turn of events, I think
                 it's prudent that we cut the evening
                 short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will
                 resolve itself, but in the
                 meantime...I'd suggest taking a
                 prayerful watch-and-wait stance!

                           HELEN
                 We'll do this again! Maybe next week.
                 Here's your hat. Could I wrap
                 something up for you? Did you have a
                 coat?

       Helen can barely get a "good night" out before Calvin
       shuts the door.

       ANGLE - DAVE AND BOB

       Following their wives out.

                 			DAVE
                     (sotto to Bob)
                 What'd I tell ya?!

       Bob whistles softly. Calvin's a nut all right.

       INT. FRONT DOOR

       Calvin turns to Helen, a grave expression on his face.

                           CALVIN
                 It's time.

                           HELEN
                     (misinterpreting, holding her
                      stomach)
                 Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time
                 yet. I still have--

       He points down.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Oh, that time! You know Calvin, I'm
                 not sure I'm really ready for this.

                           CALVIN
                 On the contrary, I think we're the
                 only ones who are.

       He leads her out of shot.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin I'm sure everything's going to
                 be all right. I just know it is!

       EXT. BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen leave the house; cross the patio; and
       hurry to the shop. Back in the house, the record player
       has been left on:  "How Much Is That Doggie In The
       Window...?"  Helen is carrying the pot roast which is
       wrapped in foil.

                           HELEN
                 Well, I'm certainly not going to let
                 the pot roast go to waste. Could you
                 just put that seat cover back on that
                 lawn chair?

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Shouldn't we at least turn off the
                 phonograph?

                           CALVIN
                 It shuts off automatically.

                           HELEN
                 Did you rig it to do that? You're so
                 clever.

                           CALVIN
                 No.  They all do.

                           HELEN
                 I never know anymore.

       The SOUND OF THE TRAINER JET makes a low pass over
       Calvin's house.  Calvin sticks his head out the door and
       looks up.

                           CALVIN
                 I bet that's a fighter jet on his way
                 to Key West!  Good luck, amigo!

       INT. WORKSHOP

       They enter. The place is full of tools and gadgets--
       mostly construction equipment. The ham radio is still on.

                           TOWER
                 An emergency has been declared. I
                 repeat, an emergency has been
                 declared.

       Calvin and Helen speak over the Tower who is telling
       other aircraft in the vicinity to clear the area.

                           CALVIN
                 You hear that?!

                           HELEN
                 Yes.

       Calvin unplugs the radio and quickly wraps the cord.

                           CALVIN
                 We can listen to the rest downstairs!

       He pushes aside a table that is hiding a hatch in the
       floor and unlocks it by turning the hatch's wheel.  Then
       he opens the hatch and reaches inside to turn on a light.
       Red submarine light shines up from below.  All the while
       he and Helen are chatting:

                           HELEN
                 Calvin, I wish you would have at least
                 let me do the dishes. It's not going
                 to be that easy getting all that dried-
                 on food off my nice plates.

                           CALVIN
                 I just hope those plates aren't
                 radioactive by tomorrow morning.

                           HELEN
                 Cheese is particularly troublesome.

                           CALVIN
                 Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
                 Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember
                 that?

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast
                 and watch your step.  I'll come back
                 for the radio.

       She steps into the hatch and onto a ladder.


       INT. JET - NIGHT

       The young pilot is bouncing around the now smokey
       cockpit.

                           PILOT
                 Tower, say again!!

                           TOWER
                 The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
                 sight.

                           PILOT
                 I'm marking the 180 radial for five
                 and ejecting.

                           TOWER
                 Roger, Wolf One.




       The pilot rights the plane; points the joy stick; and
       reaches for the ejection handles between his legs.

       EXT. JET

       The pilot ejects.

       INT. EMPTY COCKPIT

       This is the pilot's POV (were there a pilot.)  We see the
       coastline and we notice that the plane is making a... U-
       turn, away from the water and back towards the Valley.

       EXT. JET

       Streaking back to the Valley with a dramatic tail of
       sparks.

       EXT. THE PARACHUTING PILOT

       He notices that his plane is headed directly at him.  It
       misses him by a matter of yards.

       INT. LADDER - CONTINUOUS

       Taking the liberty of a CUTAWAY SECTION, we follow them
       down the ladder which is inside a corrugated metal tube.
       On either side of the tube we see layers of dirt.

                           HELEN
                 How long will we have to stay down
                 here?

                           CALVIN
                 I don't know. For this thing to blow
                 over, it could take days.

                           HELEN
                 Days??

                           CALVIN
                 Rather safe than sorry. That's my
                 motto!

                           HELEN
                 But, what if I go into labor? That
                 could happen any time.

                           CALVIN
                 I've read up on it. I'll deliver the
                 baby myself if I have to.

                           HELEN
                 Now you listen to me Calvin Webber,
                 when this baby comes, you're going to
                 be out in the waiting
                 room smoking yourself to death with
                 all the other fathers.

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 Yes, dear!

                           HELEN
                 As long as we've got that straight.

       EXT. JET - SAME TIME

       It COMPLETES ITS TURN and STREAKS SKYWARD at a 90 degree
       angle to the ground... until it SPUTTERS and the ENGINES
       STOP.  Then, after a Road Runner-like beat or two, it
       begins to FALL DIRECTLY BACK TO EARTH, tail first.

       INT. SMALL ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       The Webbers step off a metal ladder and face a vault-like
       chrome hatchway.  Calvin opens the six-inch thick door by
       pushing another switch on his small box. Helen takes the
       roast.

       EXT. JET - NIGHT

       With only the sound of wind, the jet continues to fall as
       the lights of the Valley rush up to meet it.



       INT. SHELTER - CONTINUOUS

       They step into a darkened room.

                           CALVIN
                     (with arms spread)
                 Home sweet home!

                           HELEN
                 To you maybe.

       Calvin flicks a wall switch and we HEAR A SERIES OF
       LIGHTS COMING ON.  The echoes of the sounds suggest a
       large, cavernous space.  All we can see is the cinder
       block wall behind them and the hatch door, which Calvin
       begins to shut by putting his body into it.

       Just then there is a TREMENDOUS DOUBLE EXPLOSION FROM
       ABOVE which knocks them to the floor. (Note: Helen hangs
       on to the roast, trying her best not to drop it.) The
       LADDER, CORRUGATED TUBE, ROOF, AND LOTS OR DIRT AND ROCK
       BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
       to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick
       of time.

                           HELEN
                 What was that?!

                           CALVIN
                 Are you all right?!

       Hanging on to the roast she nods vigorously, trying to be
       brave.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, I think so.

       Calvin hurries to a bright RED METAL BOX on the wall.
       Next to the box is a LARGE THERMOMETER OR GAUGE that's
       labeled "Radiation Count."  There are OTHER GAUGES that
       are dropping to zero.

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, no!  It's happened!  Look at that
                 heat!!  All my surface indicators are
                 knocked out!  Oh, my Lord...it's
                 actually happened!!

       INTER CUT - CU OF BOX AND THERMOMETER

       The box has a dial on it, next to which is a large lever.
       A foreboding sign reads  HATCHWAY TIME LOCKS, USE EXTREME
       CAUTION.  Calvin pulls the lever.

       BACK TO SCENE

       The chrome and steel EXIT HATCHWAY AUTOMATICALLY LOCKS
       with great noise, precision and...finality. There is the
       SOUND OF A REAR DOOR doing the same thing.

                           HELEN
                 What's that noise?

                           CALVIN
                 The locks.

                           HELEN
                 The locks?

                           CALVIN
                 To keep us from trying to leave. After
                 an atomic blast there's a radiation
                 half-life that lasts thirty five
                 years.

                           HELEN
                 Thirty -five years!

                           CALVIN
                 Then after that it's safe.

                           HELEN
                 It's safe.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                 To go up.

                           HELEN
                 To go up.

       She continues to stare at him.

                           CALVIN
                     (confidently)
                 Hey, honey. Don't you worry. We're
                 going to be just fine.

       Helen bursts into tears.

       EXT WEBBER PATIO - DAY

       Two police detectives, LEVY and ATKINSON, exit the house.
       Uniformed workers carefully carry small pieces of the jet
       from the crash site. The detectives lead us to what's
       left of Calvin's shop. It's mostly a charred crater.

                           LEVY
                 According to Caltech, this Webber guy
                 was a bonafide genius and a borderline
                 nutcase.

                           ATKINSON
                 Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have
                 been out here when the plane hit.

                           LEVY
                 Unless we get a postcard or somethin',
                 that's my guess.

                           ATKINSON
                 What about relatives?

                           LEVY
                 All back East.

                           ATKINSON
                 The neighbors over there said the guy
                 spent day and night out here. She'd
                 bring him sandwiches and hot Dr.
                 Pepper.

                           LEVY
                 He drank it hot?

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.

                           LEVY
                 Good god.

                           ATKINSON
                 Yeah.



       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME (12 HOURS AFTER BLAST)

       Helen awakes alone and still dressed. She sits up and
       trys the phone on the night table. It is dead. She hangs
       up and exits.

       INT. KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/PATIO

       Calvin is making sandwiches from the pot roast. Two empty
       Doctor Pepper bottles sit next to the stove where Calvin
       is heating the soda. He sees Helen enter the livingroom.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey! Feeling better?

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 We have to be strong, sweetheart. If
                 not for ourselves, for the child.

                           HELEN
                 All our friends...

       He enters with her sandwich and a cup of Dr. Pepper.

                           CALVIN
                 Burnt to a crisp.
                     (indicating sandwiches)
                 I've given you the most well-done cut.

                           HELEN
                 I'm not hungry.

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!

                           HELEN
                     (leaving)
                 No, Calvin, you're favorite.

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

       She walks out onto the patio. She rubs her arms as if
       cold.

                           CALVIN
                 A bit chilly? Shouldn't be.
                 Temperature's a nice 73 degrees.



       He follows her out to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 Maybe I've just got the creeps.

                           CALVIN
                 How could you?! This is just like
                 home!

       A reverse angle shows for the first time the rest of the
       fallout shelter -- which looks very different from
       "home". Perhaps she starts to cry again.

                           HELEN
                 No. No! Calvin, this is different!
                 Believe me!

                           CALVIN
                 Would you like a tranquilizer?

                           HELEN
                 You have tranquilizers?

                           CALVIN
                 I told you! I've got everything!











        Helen groans in pain.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no.

                           CALVIN
                 What?

                           HELEN
                 Uh, oh. Now it's time.

                           CALVIN
                 Honey?

       SCENE 29E OMITTED



       INT. VERY WIDE OF THE SHELTER - HOURS LATER

       We can only hear Adam's entrance into the world. There is
       Helen's pain, followed by Adam's cry, followed by
       Calvin's rejoicing.

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 The first child to be born on earth
                 after the annihilation!!



       INT. SHELTER - DAYS LATER

       SUPER: SEVERAL DAYS LATER

       Start on the record player in the living room. The
       country and western classic "Hey, Good Looking" is
       spinning.



       OMIT SCENE 30

       INT. SHELTER, BATTERY ROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin walks through checking things over; pleased by
       what he sees.  He exits. ("Hey Good Looking" continues.)

       INT. SHELTER, FISH FARM - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin checks the switch he uses to control the lights.
       Then he checks out all the tiny fish swimming in the six
       feet by six feet tank.  When he hears a baby's cry he
       hurries away.(Music continues)

       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM

       Calvin enters and smiles with great affection at his
       family:  Helen and a NEWBORN SON cradled next to her in
       bed.

                           CALVIN
                 Is there a problem?

                           HELEN
                 No, Calvin.  Babies cry.

                           CALVIN
                 I've noticed.

                           HELEN
                 What shall we call him?

       Calvin shrugs.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Well, I was thinking...in light of the
                 situation...that we should call him
                 Adam.  That's not sacrilegious is it?

                           CALVIN
                 No.  I think it's just right.

                           HELEN
                 And I was wondering...if...if I could
                 have a...

                           CALVIN
                 Yes!

                           HELEN
                 If I...you know...

                           CALVIN
                 What? Whatever you want, Helen!

       She points upwards.

                           HELEN
                 I want a bedroom ceiling.

       They both look up. Then he tells her.

                           CALVIN
                 You've got it!

       Calvin happily gives her his patented thumbs-up sign.

       A MONTAGE:  1) CALVIN , IN A LARGE SUPPLY ROOM, PICKS OUT
       THE PLYWOOD HE'LL NEED FOR THE CEILINGS. ( 60'S HAPPY,
       BUSY SCORE COVERS ALL THIS.)

       2) HELEN, CARRIES LITTLE ADAM (THREE DAYS OLD) ONTO THE
       FAKE PATIO (WITH THE PLASTIC PLANTS AND THE PLASTIC
       GRASS). SHE LOOKS UP AT CALVIN WHO'S ON A LADDER
       INSTALLING A CEILING.

       SUPER: SEVERAL WEEKS LATER

       3) IN THE FAMILY ROOM, CALVIN SHOWS HELEN HOW HE'S RIGGED
       A PROJECTOR TO THROW A PICTURE ONTO THE TV SCREEN. SHE'S
       THRILLED TO SEE "THE HONEYMOONERS!" MAIN TITLES COME ON.
       ADAM, LYING ON A QUILT BY HELEN'S CHAIR, IS ABOUT FOUR
       WEEKS OLD. (IT'S IMPORTANT HERE THAT WE SEE A 8MM FILM
       BOX WITH THE "I LOVE LUCY" LOGO ON IT)

       SUPER: SEVERAL MONTHS LATER

       4) TOTAL DARKNESS. THEN CALVIN FLICKS A SWITCH AND A BANK
       OF OVERHEAD LIGHTS COMES ON TO SIMULATE SUNLIGHT. UNDER
       THE LIGHTS ARE SOIL BEDS ON WOODEN TABLES. CALVIN IS
       EXCITED TO SHOW HELEN THE TINY, YOUNG CARROTS COMING UP.
       HELEN HOLDS ADAM AT THREE MONTHS OLD.

       SUPER: A YEAR LATER

       5) IN THE DINING ROOM, HELEN IS SERVING POT ROAST AND
       SOME VERY NICE LOOKING CARROTS. ADAM IS SIX MONTHS OLD.
       HE WATCHES HIS PARENTS AS THEY SAY GRACE.

       6) HELEN "SHOPS" FOR SUPPLIES IN THE LARGE STOREROOM.
       ADAM, ONE YEAR OLD, RIDES IN THE SHOPPING CART.(1963)

       7) CALVIN NETS A WIGGLING, FULLY GROWN FISH.

       8) THE FAMILY WATCHES "THE HONEYMOONERS" TOGETHER. (ADAM
       IS STILL ONE YEAR OLD.)

       CALVIN ENJOYS HIS PIPE IN THE LIVINGROOM

       9) CALVIN EXAMINES THE REAR HATCHWAY AS HELEN APPROACHES
       WITH ADAM IN HER ARMS.

                           HELEN (OC)
                 Calvin?!

                           CALVIN
                 Right here!

                           HELEN
                     (arriving)
                 We looked all over for you. What are
                 you doing back here?

                           CALVIN
                 Oh, I was just examining this rear
                 hatchway.

                           HELEN
                 Why?

                           CALVIN
                 No reason.
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, it's pretty clear that the front
                 entrance caved in when the bomb went
                 off. So, you know, when the time is
                 up, we'll have to return to the
                 surface using, you know, this back
                 entrance.  Which is very nice because
                 it has the service elevator!

                           HELEN
                 Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.  Well... yes.

       A sober beat, then:

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 You wanted to see me?

       Helen nods vigorously.

                           HELEN
                 Watch this!

                           CALVIN
                 What?

       She sets Adam (one year old) down on his wobbly little
       legs, steadying him at the shoulders.

                           HELEN
                 Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.

       And Adam takes his first step. And then another! And
       another! It's a joyous event.

       CAMERA LEAVES THEM AND TRAVELS UPWARD THROUGH THE CEILING
       AND THEN, AGAIN USING THE DEVICE OF A CUTAWAY, IT
       CONTINUES THROUGH DIRT AND SEDIMENT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE
       SURFACE-- WHERE THE BACKYARD AVOCADO TREES ARE BEING
       BULLDOZED AND THE BACK FENCE HAS ALREADY BEEN TORN DOWN.
       THE WEBBER HOUSE FACED A QUIET RESIDENTIAL STREET, BUT IT
       BACKED ONTO VICTORY AVENUE (OR ONE OF THOSE VALLEY
       AVENUES) AND IN THE LATE FIFTIES AND EARLY SIXTIES THOSE
       MAIN THOROUGHFARES WENT COMMERCIAL.

       A SIGN tells us that this is the future site of MOM'S
       MALT SHOP."

       Some WORKMEN with shovels have discovered the REAR
       SHELTER DOORS where they have been digging.



                           WORKMAN #1
                 Hey, Boss!

       The construction BOSS comes over for a look.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 What do you make of this?

                           BOSS
                 Damn if I know.

                           WORKMAN #2
                 I bet it's some kinda septic tank.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 I've never seen a septic tank that
                 looked like that.

                           BOSS
                 Well, don't fool with it. If it is a
                 septic tank, I sure as hell don't want
                 to open it. We'll just lay the
                 foundation over it.

                           WORKMAN #1
                 Okay.

       EXT. WEBBER HOUSE, PATIO (THE REAL ONE) - DAY, SAME TIME

       A Realtor steps out with A COUPLE looking to buy the
       house.

                           REALTOR
                 ...and since it's almost certain that
                 the Webbers were killed, the bank is
                 selling the house and that back parcel
                 over there that's been re-zoned
                 commercial. It's right there on the
                 avenue.

                           WOMAN BUYER
                 Is that where the plane crashed?

       She points out to a LEVEL LAWN where the shop used to be.
       We can see the Malt Shop construction crew beyond that.

                           REALTOR
                 Yep, right there.

                           MAN BUYER
                 This place gives me the willies.

                           REALTOR
                 Yeah, I know what you mean. But the
                 price is right.

       EXT. BACK AT THE MALT SHOP CONSTRUCTION SIGHT -
       CONTINUOUS, DAY

       The guy driving the heavy front loader lets the bucket
       slam to the ground hard.

       INT. BACK AT THE SHELTER REAR DOOR - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin vaguely hears the noise made by the front loader.

       INT. SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - EVENING (1965-66)

       SUPER: 1965

       Calvin smokes his pipe and enjoys a Manhattan cocktail as
       Adam (three and a half) sits in his lap reading the title
       page from Alice in Wonderland.

                           ADAM
                 Al ice in won der lan.

       Calvin smiles pridefully over at Helen who works
       intensely on the couch making a coffee-can Santa from
       instructions in the The Redbook Crafts Collection.

                           CALVIN
                 Not bad for a three and a half year
                 old! I'd like to see the public school
                 system match that! I don't care how
                 terrific it is!

                           HELEN
                 Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like
                 his father. But you know, Calvin,
                 maybe he's a little...young for
                 school.

                           CALVIN
                 Nonsense. People have no idea what the
                 human mind is capable of. Look at us!

       Helen ponders that statement.


                           ADAM
                     (pointing to the book's art
                      work)
                 Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole,
                 just like us.

       Calvin smiles and messes up Adam's hair.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Will I ever get to go up on top?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, you certainly will. And you'll
                 find a nice girl and rebuild America.
                 Just the way it used to be.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be
                 making promises that perhaps can't be
                 kept.

                           CALVIN
                 I believe there will be other
                 survivors. In fact, I'm guessing
                 there's life on the surface, even now.
                 It's not life worth living perhaps,
                 but believe me, something's moving
                 around up there. And I don't just mean
                 the cockroaches.

       They both look nervously up at the ceiling.

       EXT. MOM'S MALT SHOP (NOW FINISHED) - DAY (1965-66)

       CARS PASS BY on the busy avenue.

       INT. MOM'S MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       CLEAN CUT SURFER KIDS are being served their favorite ice-
       cream and malt treats by MOM herself and a young SODA
       JERK. Appropriate music comes from the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 I'm going to need two more banana-
                 splits and a cherry coke!

                           SODA JERK
                 You bet, Mom! Coming up!

       Two YOUNG MEN IN BEATLE HAIRCUTS enter. Everyone looks at
       them in amazement. (Perhaps there is also a record change
       here.)

       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM - DAY (65-66)

       Calvin is building and furnishing a classroom from
       materials available to him. He has had the forethought to
       bring down the books needed for his child's education.
       Little Adam is watching him.

                           CALVIN
                     (to Adam)
                 Nothing in the world is more fun than
                 learning new things.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

       The family watches the same "Honeymooner" clip they
       watched before. Calvin still finds it funny. Helen
       wonders about that.

       INT. BEDROOM - LATER

       Helen is pouring cooking sherry into an empty Listerine
       bottle.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1970-71)

       SUPER: 1970

       Other buildings have been constructed around the malt
       shop. Foot and car traffic are heavier.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       The clean-cut kids have been replaced by FLOWER CHILDREN.
       Mom hasn't put a lot back into the decor, but she has
       made concessions to the fashions of the time. The jukebox
       plays something appropriate. Mom and the Jerk are five
       years older.

                           MOM
                 I can't tell the boys from the girls
                 anymore!

                           SODA JERK
                     (stoned)
                 Uh...yeah. It's like hard.

       Mom gives the Jerk a suspicious look.

       INT. SHELTER - DAY (1970-71)

       Calvin (40) is giving Adam (8) a boxing lesson. They work
       from a "How To" book and use gloves made from living room
       pillows. Adam's pretty good. Helen appears and watches
       with pride. Then she interupts.

                           HELEN
                 Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it's my
                 turn.
                     (holding out her hand)
                 Adam?

       He goes to her.

       INT. SHELTER - MINUTES LATER

       The hydroponic garden area is empty. A Perry Como song
       begins and Adam and Helen enter waltzing. Adam has
       changed shirts and combed his hair. Somewhere, Calvin is
       watching with pride. After a while Calvin cuts in. He and
       Helen dance beautifully. Then they kiss. Somewhere, Adam
       is watching with pride.

       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1975-76)

       SUPER: 1975

       The place continues its decline. Acid rock plays loudly.
       Mom and the Jerk serve the smallish crowd.

                           MOM
                 I miss those nice flower-power kids.
                 How 'bout you?

                           SODA JERK
                     (after studying her for some
                      time)
                 Um...uh...

       The acid rock song ends and an early, bad disco hit comes
       on the jukebox.

                           MOM
                 What the hell kind of music is that?!

       The Jerk puts his hands to his ears, he so hates the new
       music.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, man. I'm like not sure I like
                 that.



       INT. SHELTER, CLASSROOM  (1975-76)

       The room looks like Ricky Nelson's class.  There are twin
       pictures of Ike and JFK on the wall.  Adam is eleven.

                           CALVIN
                 This is what money looks like.  It
                 comes like this, in coin, or like this
                 in paper.  Or you can have an
                 "investment."  These are stock
                 "certificates" that we bought in your
                 name.  Of course, they're worthless
                 now, but at one time they were quite
                 valuable.

                           ADAM
                 They're pretty.  Can I have them?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure. Now, let's move on to our French
                 exam.

                           ADAM
                 Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.

                           CALVIN
                 You're right!  It's Tuesday already!
                 By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 Tempus fugit!

                           CALVIN
                 En arte voluptus.
                 Que les bons temps roulÈ!

                           ADAM
                 Gerade aus dann links!

                           CALVIN
                 Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack
                 sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!

                           ADAM
                 Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!

                           CALVIN
                     (marveling)
                 You know, you have a wonderful sense
                 of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn
                 doesn't fall very far from the tree.
                 By the way, it's time I gave you
                 something. Come with me.

       Adam follows his dad out.

       INT. SHUFFLEBOARD COURT - CONTINUOUS

       They pass Helen who is absentmindedly poking at the puck
       with a stick. She's not having a very good day. She wears
       her hair dryer but it's not plugged in.

                           CALVIN
                 Hi, honey!

                           HELEN
                 Hi.

       INT. BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin hands Adam a cigar box. Adam opens it to see
       Calvin's remarkable baseball card collection.

                           ADAM
                 These are wonderful.

                           CALVIN
                 It's my entire baseball collection.
                 It's yours now.

                           ADAM
                 What's baseball?

                           CALVIN
                 It's a game, son. I can explain it
                 pretty easily. There's a pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like a painting?

                           CALVIN
                     (chuckling)
                 No, son. A pitcher.

                           ADAM
                 Like one of Mom's?

                           CALVIN
                 Uh, no. There's a man who throws the
                 ball -- to a man who has a bat.

                           ADAM
                 The nocturnal flying mammal?

                           CALVIN
                     (slightly pissed)
                 No. Sit down.

       They do.

       INT. SHELTER - NIGHT

       Start close on flashing roller skates. Then cut wider to
       show Adam roller skating. He passes Helen who has fallen
       asleep knitting in one of the lawn chairs. Then Adam
       passes Calvin who is on a ladder soldering a leaking
       ceiling pipe.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       SUPER: 1991

       TWO PUNKS with spiked green hair enter to the strains of
       "My Sharona."


       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY (1991)

       Mom watches the punks enter. Then crosses to the Soda
       Jerk who now has a tattoo on his forehead.

                           MOM
                 I'm selling this place.  I want out of
                 this hell hole!

                           SODA JERK
                 Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...

                           MOM
                 Buy it from me?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!

                           MOM
                 I'll give it to ya, no money down.
                 The neighborhood has gone to hell
                 anyway.

       She walks off.

                           SODA JERK
                 Cool.

       INT. KITCHEN  (1995)

       SUPER: 1995

       Helen has prepared a birthday cake. Having no birthday
       candles, she's used three votive candles. We can hear
       Calvin and Adam talking in the dining room. (She and
       Calvin are now in their 60's.)

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 No, no! The runner on second goes to
                 third! He's out there!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Why?

                           CALVIN (OC)
                 Because he's forced out at third! It's
                 a force!

                           ADAM  (OC)
                 Then why go there?

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Because he must!

                           HELEN
                 Calvin!

                           CALVIN  (OC)
                 Coming!

       Calvin enters.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Yes, dear?

                           HELEN
                 Get the presents and do the lights.

                           CALVIN
                 You bet.

       Calvin leaves while Helen lights the candles. The whole
       shelter goes dark. Calvin returns with two presents
       wrapped in whatever is available.

       INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS



       Helen and Calvin enter singing Happy Birthday. We see the
       ADULT ADAM for the first time in silhouette. His handsome
       face is revealed to us when the cake is placed before
       him.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!

                           CALVIN
                 Blow out the candles!

                           HELEN
                 Make a wish!

       He does both. His parents clap. Helen takes one of the
       presents from Calvin and gives it to Adam. He unwraps it.
       It's a green coat.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, boy! A jacket!

                           CALVIN
                 Your mom made that all by herself.

                           ADAM
                 No kidding!

                           HELEN
                 No kidding.
                     (aside, to Calvin)
                 Who else would have done it?

                           CALVIN
                 And I made these!

       He gives Adam the second present. Adam tears off the
       paper to find a pair of roller-skates that Calvin has
       redesigned. The new skates look kind of like
       rollerblades.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!

                           CALVIN
                 Your roller-skates! I redesigned them!
                 I think this new design will work even
                 better!

                           ADAM
                 These are really swell! I mean swell!

                           HELEN
                 What did you wish for, Adam?

                           CALVIN
                 If he tells, it won't come true!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We
                 never believed that in my family!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we did in my family!

                           ADAM
                 I wished I could meet a girl.

       His parents don't have a reply for that.

                           HELEN
                 Oh. A nice one, I hope.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           CALVIN
                 One who doesn't glow in the dark.

                           HELEN
                 Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, we'll be going up in two years.
                 We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.

                           ADAM
                     (ardently)
                 Me, too.

       His parents stare at him for a beat, then:

                           HELEN
                 Let's eat our cake.

                           CALVIN
                 Yeah. Let's dig in!

       They do.

                           HELEN
                 Elbows, Son.

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, Mom!

                           HELEN
                 You never know. You may someday dine
                 at the White House with the president.

                           CALVIN
                 If we still have one.

                           HELEN
                 Yes...

                           CALVIN
                 You know, when we do go up...I'm going
                 to miss this old place. How 'bout you,
                 hon?

                           HELEN
                     (after a beat)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           CALVIN
                 Sure.

       Helen rises and exits.

       INT. BATTERY ROOM- LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen enters and goes into the generator room. Through
       the glass we can see (and hear) her scream. Straightening
       her hair and feeling much better, she exits as Calvin
       strolls by wearing his tool belt. She's headed out.

                           CALVIN
                 In the generator room again?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how
                 all    these things work.

                           CALVIN
                 I know exactly what you mean!
                     (then)
                 Hey, honey?

       She turns to him. He gives her his patented thumbs up
       sign.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 Great cake!!

       She smiles wanely and leaves. He shuts the generator door
       she left open.

       INT.SHELTER, LIVING ROOM - VERY EARLY MORNING

       SUPER: THE PRESENT

       The room is quiet and empty.  The star-burst WALL CLOCK
       on the paneling says 6:15.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Also empty.

       INT. STOREROOM - SAME TIME

       Also empty.  And with MEAGER SUPPLIES on the shelves.

       INT. POWER AND PUMP ROOM - SAME TIME

       The old pipes are rusted and patched. Some are leaking
       badly.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin wakes up. He looks over at Helen's bed.

       ANGLE - HELEN

       She wakes up. Then jumps out of bed.



       SCENE 67 OMITTED



       CLOSE ON THE RED METAL BOX

       that has been ticking on the wall for thirty-five years.
       Suddenly it STOPS TICKING and a rather annoying ALARM
       GOES OFF.  Calvin's hand reaches up and turns it off by
       throwing the lever up.

       ANOTHER ANGLE shows us the mechanism on the FRONT
       HATCHWAY switch to OPEN with a loud, vault-like move.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       reveals the family in their pajamas standing in front of
       the front hatchway and red box.

                           ADAM
                 So...we just open this door and go up?



       Calvin grabs a handle and using all his strength, opens
       the front entrance hatch. And then must jump back when
       nothing but earth and rock pour into the room.

                           ADAM
                 Um...is that supposed to happen?

       His parents take a beat then race off like maniacs
       through the entire shelter to the back hatch door.  They
       knock over whatever gets in their way as they go. Adam
       follows.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, where are we going?!  Is
                 everything all right?!

       INT. BACK HATCHWAY - MOMENTS LATER

       Calvin and Helen arrive followed by Adam who can't
       possibly share his parent's deep concerns. Everyone is
       out of breath.

                           CALVIN
                 Should we say a little prayer first?

                           HELEN
                 Just open the door.

       Calvin attempts to open the big hatch, but can't.  Adam
       helps him.  Helen pitches in.  Slowly, with lots of
       squeaking, the DOOR OPENS. He steps through the hatch and
       flips a wall switch.  Red submarine LIGHTS COME ON....
       And the service elevator is intact.

       INT. ANTEROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen steps through and embraces Calvin joyfully.  The
       old folks break into a dance as Adam enters.

                           ADAM
                 Well, do we just go on up?!

                           CALVIN
                     (quickly back to business,
                      and way too dramatic)
                 No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is
                 precisely when... we must be at our...
                 most cautious.

                           HELEN
                     (barely a whisper, but
                      definitely tired of his
                      B.S.)
                 Oh, shit.

       Helen's eyes widen and her hand flies up to her mouth.
       She is just as shocked as Calvin.

                           CALVIN
                 Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have
                 been down here a little too long!
                     (to Adam)
                 Please excuse her French.

                           ADAM
                 Shit is a French word?

                           HELEN
                 Yes, yes it is!

                           CALVIN
                 It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly
                 meaning..."good".

                           HELEN
                 Yes! That's right!

                           ADAM
                 Oh.
                     (then)
                 Well...then...shit!

       There is a pause, then:

                           CALVIN
                 C'est bon, Monsieur.

                           ADAM
                 Merci!

       SCENE 71 OMITTED



       EXT. THE MALT SHOP - NIGHT

       Cars flash by in a rare L.A. DOWNPOUR.  All that's left
       of Mom's is an EMPTY BUILDING with a painted-out front
       window and a "For Sale or Rent" sign.  There's ANOTHER
       SHOP attached to it CAMERA RIGHT but we can't see what it
       is.  The alley way on the left has always been there.

       INT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       TWO DRUNK BUMS are sharing a bottle. One of them is the
       Soda Jerk, now a  dissipated middle-aged man (with a
       tattoo on his forehead.)

                           SODA JERK
                 ...all of these things...Alcoholics
                 Anonymous...Cocaine Anonymous...Heroin
                 Anonymous.

                           OTHER BUM
                 There's a Heroin Anonymous?

                            SODA JERK
                 Shut up! All of these things... ask
                 you to believe in a power greater than
                 yourself! Some sort of God on High!
                 Well...I have lifted my eyes skyward a
                 time or two... and I have certainly
                 not seen anything coming from up there
                 except a goddamn airplane -- that I
                 can't afford to get on!

       The cement FLOOR of the old Malt Shop begins to QUIVER
       AND RUMBLE.

                           OTHER BUM
                 Earthquake!  Another earthquake!

                           SODA JERK
                 Let her come!  Let's get this over
                 with!  And please, if there is a God,
                 let it be worse in Bel Air!!

       The Other Bum staggers to his feet and SPLITS for a back
       window.  Soda Jerk is fearless.  Until finally the
       HYDRAULIC DOORS of the back entrance SPLIT THE FLOOR with
       an eerie, struggling whine and LARGE CHUNKS OF CEMENT GO
       FLYING.  Then up comes RED SUBMARINE LIGHT followed by
       Calvin in his BIG YELLOW SUIT with Geiger counter
       ticking.

                           SODA JERK
                 Oh, God!  Oh, God!!  Oh,God, save me!!
                 For I have seen the light!!

       Calvin raises his hand and yells through his mask.

                           CALVIN
                 I come in peace!!

       The Soda Jerk FAINTS. Calvin, sounding like a deep sea
       diver and having to walk like Frankenstein, goes over to
       the Soda Jerk and studies his face in the light of his
       flashlight.  He is horrified by what he sees.

                           CALVIN
                 My, gosh...

       Calvin looks around the room and heads for the back.  He
       moves his Geiger counter around and gets a quiet (safe)
       reading. Then he removes a KITCHEN MATCH from a plastic
       container and strikes it against the wall.  The MATCH
       BURNS, so Calvin takes off his hood and visor and
       breathes the air.  It stinks in there.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER, RAINING

       Calvin (out of the head gear and top of the suit) slowly
       pushes the door open and steps out. He's surprised to
       find an empty BODY SHOP behind the Malt Shop, where the
       avocado trees should be.

                           CALVIN
                 Where is my backyard?

       He points his flashlight around and heads for the ALLEY
       to his left.

       EXT. ALLEY - A MOMENT LATER, RAINING

       DERELICT CARS left over from the Body Shop sit against a
       fence. Calvin marvels at the cars, even in their present
       condition.  In a TIGHTER SHOT he studies the chrome-
       plated word "Toyota."   A HOMELESS MAN arrives to search
       through the garbage. Calvin hurries back towards the
       avenue.

       SCENE 76 OMITTED

       EXT. MALT SHOP - TEN MINUTES LATER, RAIN

       Calvin emerges from the alley that separates the Malt
       Shop from another storefront (perhaps now a rundown Thai
       restaurant.)

       CLOSER ON HIM

       watching the cars fly by on the wet avenue.  Suddenly, a
       cross-dressing STREET WALKER steps up to him with a
       cigarette.

                           STREET WALKER
                 You got a light, honey?

                           CALVIN
                 What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a
                 light!

                           STREET WALKER
                 Good.

       Fumbling, he finally gets her little cigar lighted with
       one of his kitchen matches.

                           CALVIN
                 So...you...survived the blast, did
                 you?

                           STREET WALKER
                 The blast?  Honey, I have survived a
                 host of things. Like the song says: "A
                 country boy can survive!"

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has
                 it been...hell up here?

                           STREET WALKER
                 "Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell
                 up here, down there and over yonder!
                 Hell everywhere.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, I can tell that just looking
                 around.
                 		(then)
                 "Boy?"  Did you say you were a
                 "country boy?"

                           STREET WALKER
                 Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
                 boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want
                 a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be
                 anything you want me to be!

                           CALVIN
                 Really?

                           STREET WALKER
                 Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the
                 remarkably low price of only $200!
                 And if you act now, I might even throw
                 in some free lawn furniture.

                           CALVIN
                     (stumbling away from her)
                 No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to
                 go!  I have to...

       He breaks into a trot, heading up the street past a seedy
       BAR (used to be the convenience store) just as a
       hopelessly DRUNK HAG of a woman is shoved out and told to
       stay out.  Calvin watches as the woman stumbles to the
       curb where she TOSSES her cookies.  TWO LOW RIDERS HOP BY
       full of TAUNTING YOUNG HISPANIC GANG MEMBERS, one of whom
       BRANDISHES A PISTOL and, just for fun, points it at
       Calvin.  When Calvin sees the pistol he ducks into the
       ADULT BOOKSTORE. The young gang member pulls the trigger
       and we (not Calvin) see that the realistic-looking pistol
       is really a water gun.

       INT. ADULT BOOK AND VIDEO STORE

       Calvin races in and, gathering himself, addresses the
       PAKISTANI MAN behind the counter.

                           CALVIN
                 Hello!  How are you this evening?!
                 Mind if I, you know, browse around?!

       The clerk just watches him.

                           CALVIN
                 Thank-Q very much!

       Then Calvin turns and has his first look at the
       material...and he GRABS HIS HEART and SCREAMS and FALLS
       back KNOCKING OVER a whole ROW OF VIDEOS AND MAGAZINES.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin sits at the breakfast table, still breathing hard
       and holding his chest.  His family looks on with great
       concern.  The anti-radiation suit and gear is piled in
       the corner.

                           CALVIN
                 I'm going to give it to you straight.
                 There's no point in beating around the
                 bush. There were survivors.
                 Apparently,
                 the fallout has created....a
                 subspecies of mutants.

                           HELEN
                 Mutants?!

                           CALVIN
                 It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out
                 of garbage cans.  Others are...cover
                 your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that
                 literally and I mean right now!

       ADAM covers his ears and hums.

                           CALVIN
                 Others are...multi-sexual.  It
                 seems...they can be both masculine and
                 feminine...simultaneously.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 I don't believe it!

       Helen copes by moving around the kitchen doing things
       that don't need to be done.


                           CALVIN
                 Believe it. He tried to sell me his
                 body, Helen.
                 		(beat)
                 They offer lawn furniture as a come
                 on!

       She slumps, then resumes her needless activity.  Calvin
       takes Adam's arm and the son drops his hands and stops
       humming.

                           CALVIN
                 They've done a lot of re-building but
                 society, at least as we knew it, has
                 utterly collapsed. People throw up in
                 the streets. Others point guns.
                 There's something terribly wrong with
                 the automobiles and...and I...I can't
                 tell you the rest.  I just can't.

                           HELEN
                 Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So,
                 what do we do now?

                           CALVIN
                 We stay down here.

                           HELEN
                 We do?

                           CALVIN
                 Yes.

                           HELEN
                 Excuse me.

       She hurries into the living room.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Helen let's out a silent scream, then hurries back into
       the kitchen.

       INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS



                           HELEN
                 For how long?  We've just about run
                 out of everything!

                           CALVIN
                 We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion
                 that these mutants will eventually
                 kill each other off and then--

                           HELEN
                     (rising)
                 No, Calvin.  We're not going to make
                 do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going
                 up no matter what!  We deserve it.
                 Even if it's terrible!

                           CALVIN
                 Well, I am the head of this household--

                           HELEN
                 I want him to at least see the sky!

                           CALVIN
                 --and we will--

                           HELEN
                 And the ocean!  A mountain range!

                           CALVIN
                 --do as I say!

       Breathing heavily, Calvin suddenly clutches at his chest
       in great pain and collapses.

                           ADAM
                 Dad!

                           HELEN
                 Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get
                 him into the bedroom.

       INT. HALLWAY - HOURS LATER

       Adam paces.  Then Helen comes out.  Behind her, we can
       see Calvin sleeping in his bed. She heads for the living
       room. He follows.

                           HELEN
                 He seems to be doing all right now.  I
                 don't know if he's had a heart attack
                 or just... a horrifying experience.
                 But we  need supplies and I've got to
                 stay with him.

                           ADAM
                 I'll go up.

       They go through the living room and cross to the patio.

                           HELEN
                 I'm afraid you've got to.

                           ADAM
                 I'll be all right.

                           HELEN
                     (patting his cheek)
                 You're my brave boy.



       Helen hands him a pencil and pad. Adam follows her to the
       fish farm.

                           HELEN
                 Just act normal.  If anybody asks,
                 simply say you're from out-of-town,
                 and that you're in town on business.
                 Write that down.

       He does.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 I'm going to give you a shopping list
                 and some money.  We need just enough
                 things to get us through the next year
                 or two.  And you'll find most of these
                 items at what used to be called a
                 grocery store or a hardware store.
                 Write that down.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       At the fish tank, Helen pulls up a slim chain that is
       attached to a water-tight aluminum box which she quickly
       opens. The box contains $6,000 in wrapped one hundred
       dollar bills. Helen takes half of it.

                           HELEN
                 I don't know how far you'll have to
                 travel to find supplies, but if you
                 can't get home by nightfall, I want
                 you to look for something called a
                 Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a
                 hotel. There might still be one
                 standing.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.


                           HELEN
                 Let's get you packed.

       She heads back for the house. He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           HELEN
                     (indicating money)
                 I just hope this is still good up
                 there.

                           ADAM
                 Mom?


                           HELEN
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking that, uh...you know,
                 while I was up there and all...that
                 maybe I could, you know...try to meet
                 a girl.  I've, been thinking about
                 that a little...just these
                 last...fifteen years or so.

       They have stopped by the garden.


                           HELEN
                 Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if
                 you could find a girl. One who's not a
                 mutant...and hopefully comes from
                 Pasadena. Nothing against Valley
                 girls,
                 but in my day anyhow, the girls from
                 Pasadena, I don't know...always just
                 seemed a little nicer.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

       They hug.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, there's also a thing called a
                 liquor store. Write that down.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

       He is packing. He looks at his cigar box and opens it. He
       studies the contents: The Cards, stock certificates, and
       an old photo of his parents. He decides to pack the box.
       Helen enters with a long shopping list.

                           HELEN
                 Here's the shopping list and $3,000
                 which should take care of everything.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.

                           HELEN
                 Your father has a few final words for
                 you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw
                 for you - he loves you so much. We
                 both do.

                           ADAM
                 Heck, I know that mom! You're my
                 parents.

       INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam sets down his suitcase and goes to his father's bed.
       He sits. At the door, Helen dries her eyes with her
       apron.  Calvin indicates that he wants to whisper to
       Adam, who drops his ear close to his father's lips.

                           CALVIN
                 Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...

                           ADAM
                 Yes, father?! Yes?

                           CALVIN
                 ...the pipe tobacco.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir.  Is that all?

       Calvin nods. Adam rises and starts for the door. But
       Calvin remembers something and beckons him back to speak
       weakly into his son's ear.

                           CALVIN
                 Also...stay out of the "Adult
                 Bookstore."

                           ADAM
                 Adult Bookstore.  Why?

                           CALVIN
                 Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.

                           ADAM
                 I promise. Is that all?

                           CALVIN
                 One more thing. If you find a healthy
                 young woman, bring her back with you.

                           ADAM
                 I'll try.

       And then Calvin closes his eyes and sleeps.

       INT. MALT SHOP - SAME DAY

       The Soda Jerk has turned the rear exit into a religious
       shrine.  He's put flowers and candles and costume jewelry
       and religious icons (from all the Majors) on top of and
       around the broken cement.  Currently he's on his knees,
       rocking back and forth as he prays.

       And,lo! There came a rumbling even as from the very
       bowels of the earth and a great light showed forth
       followed by gates of armor which opened and shut and
       delivered up the vision of a young man whose countenance
       caused the Soda Jerk to be struck dumb and to fall on his
       face and to weep in fear.  And, Adam, taking pity on the
       man, put down his suitcase, and went to him, saying:

                           ADAM
                 Are you all right?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes!
                 But  where is the one who came last
                 night -- all in yellow?!

                           ADAM
                 All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my
                 father!

                           SODA JERK
                 Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father!
                 Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for
                 my wasted life?!  Everything has been
                 so awful!!

                           ADAM
                     (comforting him)
                 I know it has been terrible.  But it
                 wasn't your fault. And now all the
                 decay is over with and things are
                 going to get better. You understand?

                           SODA JERK
                 Yes.

                           ADAM
                 I've got to go, now.

                           SODA JERK
                 Of course you do.  I'll stay here and
                 pray.

                           ADAM
                     (picking up his suitcase)
                 That's always a good idea! Would you
                 like some money? I have a great deal
                 of it.

                           SODA JERK
                 No. I don't need money anymore -- I
                 see that now.

                           ADAM
                 How do I leave here?

                           SODA JERK
                 The front door is open.  Will you be
                 back?

                           ADAM
                 I promise.

       Adam turns and leaves. The Soda Jerk falls to his knees
       and shakes all over.

       EXT. MALT SHOP - CONTINUOUS

       Adam steps out onto the sidewalk and sunlight falls on
       him much brighter than anything he has ever seen.  He
       looks at it on the arm of his coat and then, slowly, he
       looks up at the sky.

       INTERCUT - LOVELY CLOUDS AND BLUE SKY

       And now it is Adam who is dumbstruck. BYSTANDER #1
       appears and sees Adam looking up.

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 What?  What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 The sky!!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 The sky?  Where?

                           ADAM
                     (pointing)
                 Up there!!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                 I don't see anything!

                           ADAM
                 Just look!!

       Adam becomes momentarily interested in a parking meter.

       A MOTHER and her CHILD approach from the other direction.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it!

                           BYSTANDER #1
                     (pointing)
                 He sees something.

                           MOTHER
                 What?

                           CHILD
                 I see it, mommy!

                           BYSTANDER #2
                 Where?!


       Several more people are drawn over. A CONVERTIBLE goes by
       in the foreground with passengers who are looking up.

                           WOMAN
                 What is it?

                           ADAM
                 I have never in my life seen anything
                 like this!!!! Nothing even comes
                 close!!

       Adam continues down the sidewalk,looking up. A BLACK
       WOMAN POSTAL WORKER passes by.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                 Whatcha looking at?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (with attitude)
                 Say what?!

                           ADAM
                     (offering his hand)
                 How do you do, ma'am.

                           POSTAL WORKER
                     (leary, but taking his hand)
                 I do alright.

                           ADAM
                 Good!

       The Pakistani exits the Adult Bookstore.


                           PAKISTANI
                 What is it?!  What do you see?!

       When Adam looks down to answer the man he sees the "Adult
       Bookstore" sign.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, no!

                           PAKISTANI
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Poisonous gas!!  Run for your life,
                 it's invisible poisonous gas!!!

       And everyone does run away, including Adam. The avenue is
       left totally deserted.



       INT. KITCHEN NOOK - SAME DAY

       Helen sits sipping tea, deep in thoughts of concern for
       Adam. Behind her Calvin appears in the open window.

                           CALVIN
                 You know--

       Helen is so startled she knocks the tea all over the
       place.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 I just wanted to say that I think he's
                 going to be just fine.

                           HELEN
                     (holding her heart)
                 Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very
                 much.

       Calvin leaves, then comes back.

                           CALVIN
                 He's smart.

                           HELEN
                 Yes, dear, I know.



       SCENE 85A OMITTED


       EXT. CORNER BUS STOP - AFTERNOON, SAME DAY

       An L.A. bus comes directly at CAMERA.



       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       is startled. He reacts.

       ANGLE - DRIVER'S FOOT

       slamming down the brake pedal.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       in profile. The braking bus stops an inch from his nose.
       Adam smiles. (Have him head for bus door in this angle.)

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER

       from over Adam. He is in shock.



       INT. BUS - A MOMENT LATER

       Start on a MOVING STEADY CAM SHOT on Adam's POV of bus
       passengers as he heads for a seat. The passengers look at
       him in amazement and some fear.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       going to his seat; smiling at the passengers. (He is
       carrying a $100 bill.)

                           ADAM
                 Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.

       Adam finds a seat next to a heavily perspiring young
       PSYCHO HEROIN ADDICT.

       ANOTHER ANGLE OF THEM

       Adam shows the Psycho the $100 bill.

                           ADAM
                 I tried to give the driver this but he
                 wouldn't take it. He seems angry. A
                 lot of people do.

       The bus pulls out. It gets up to about twenty miles an
       hour.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Oh, boy! Here we go! We're moving!
                 Wow.

       INTERCUT: PASSENGERS

       looking back at Adam with concern.

                           ADAM (CONT'D)

                 So this is public transportation. My
                 Dad says that it becomes more and more
                 important because of pollution --
                 which is more and more carbon dioxide
                 and other hazardous gases in the air.
                     (then, confidentially)
                 Do you have a gun, by the way?

       The increasingly nervous Psycho looks around, then nods
       that he does.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Well, thanks for not waving it around.
                 And for not vomitting, for that
                 matter. Wow, we're really flying. Say,
                 do you know where I could find a
                 grocery store?

       The psycho shakes his head.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I have to find that. And a hardware
                 store  and a liquour store and a
                 standing Holiday Inn. Although, I may
                 not need the Holiday Inn. That's still
                 kind of up in the air. It depends
                 really on how things go.

                           PSYCHO
                     (pointing)
                 There's a grocery store coming up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!
                     (jumping up)
                 Driver! Please stop the bus
                 immediately! I have to get off!
                     (then an aside to the psycho)
                 Do you think I should get a gun?

                           PSYCHO
                 I don't know...maybe.

                           ADAM
                     (back to driver)
                 Driver! Please stop, sir!

       INTERCUT - DRIVER IN THE REAR VIEW

       He's not going to stop until he wants to stop.

       ANGLE - OLD JEWISH COUPLE PASSENGERS.

       who are anxious for Adam to leave.

                           OLD JEWISH MAN
                 For the love of God! Let him off the
                 bus!! Can't you see he's meshugina!

       Adam leans in close to the OLD MAN.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, what did you call me?

       The man and his wife take that the wrong way and start to
       scream.

       ANGLE - THE DRIVER'S FOOT

       hitting the brakes.

       EXT.- BUS

       stopping suddenly. Through the windows we see Adam go
       down.

       INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS

       The back door opens as Adam gets up.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!

       Adam exits the bus. Everyone, including the Psycho,
       heaves a huge sign of relief.

       INT. SUPER MARKET - MINUTES LATER

       Adam enters and (after getting over the automatic doors
       and the check-out technology) is overwhelmed by the
       magnificence of the postmodern California supermarket.
       The check-out counters alone are amazing. Seeing others
       do it, he takes a cart, placing his suitcase in it.

       INT. BAKERY COUNTER

       Adam passes the baked goods, paying particular attention
       to the elaborate birthday cakes.

                           ADAM
                 Is that a birthday cake?!

                           CLERK
                 Yes, it is.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-ma-nee!

       Adam leaves. The clerk turns to a fellow worker.

                           CLERK
                 Bakersfield.

       INT. AISLE

       Adam marvels at the abundance and variety. He passes a
       mother whose child is riding in the cart and that reminds
       him of his own mom -- when she used to let him ride that
       way.  Then he is surprised to see a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE so
       casually dressed in public. She (overweight) is in an
       unfortunate terrycloth halter-shorts combination.  He
       (hirsute) is in a sleeveless undershirt and baggy bathing
       trunks.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 My first mutants.

       INT. FRESH PRODUCE

       Adam picks up one of those huge California cucumbers that
       always amaze Easterners.  He shows it to the JAPANESE-
       AMERICAN CLERK.

                           ADAM
                 Is this because of the radiation?

                           CLERK
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Nothing.

       INT. MEAT COUNTER

       Adam is looking at the live lobsters as a BUTCHER steps
       up.

                           BUTCHER
                 Help you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, please.
                     (consulting his Mom's list)
                 I'm looking for all beef patties.



                           BUTCHER
                 Fresh or frozen?

       Adam chuckles because he thinks the man is kidding.

                           ADAM
                 Come on. Frozen. How much are they?

                           BUTCHER
                 Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in
                 the three pound box.

                           ADAM
                 Then I'll need, twelve into nine
                 hundred, seventy-five boxes. And
                 that's almost...five hundred dollars
                 just for the hamburger! And my Mom
                 only gave me three thousand dollars
                 for everything! The yacht batteries!
                 The diesel oil! The birthday candles!

                           BUTCHER
                 You could have a meat order that big
                 delivered to your home.

                           ADAM

                 Really?!

                           BUTCHER
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 Well, that's great then!
                 Terrific...except...it just occurred
                 to me. I don't know where I live! I'm
                 lost! I don't know where home is!
                     (then)
                 Would you excuse me?

                           BUTCHER
                 Gladly.

       Adam hurries away.



       SCENE 93 OMITTED

       SCENE 94 OMITTED



       A MONTAGE

       of Adam on another bus. He looks frantically out the
       window. We see his POV of shops and stores and people. At
       one point he sees two women joggers which he wonders
       about. Then he sees two men arguing violently. Gradually
       late day turns to night and Adam becomes more and more
       depressed. Then he sees something. He is elated. He jumps
       up and tells the driver:

                           ADAM
                 Driver! Stop this bus immediately!
                 Please sir!!

       EXT. - VENTURA BLVD - NIGHT

       The bus stops mid-block and Adam gets off. He crosses the
       street causing only one car to hit the brakes. On the
       other side of the avenue we see what has gotten his
       attention. It's an ADULT BOOKSTORE much like the last one
       we saw (probably owned by the same chain.) He's happy but
       when he looks next door he sees he's in a different
       place. Sad and lost he turns north and starts to walk
       until -- a billboard catches his attention. We pan up to
       see a billboard for liposuction that features an almost
       NUDE WOMAN. Adam is struck by the image and we spend some
       time cutting between him and it. Then gathering himself
       he turns and begins to walk south.

       ANOTHER ANGLE

       of him as he passes a BODY PIERCING STORE and wonders
       about that. Then he sees something that blows his mind.

       WIDER ANGLE

       of a STRAY DOG passing by. Adam reacts.

                           ADAM
                 Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh,
                 my...Oh. That is so great!! Man alive!

       ANGLE - CU OF BASEBALL CARDS STORE WINDOW



       A sign says: COMIC BOOKS & BASEBALL CARDS BOUGHT, SOLD &
       TRADED.

       INT. CARD AND COMIC STORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam enters with his suitcase in one hand and his cigar
       box in the other.  He steps up to the counter where the
       owner (JERRY) sits reading the newspaper. He has a
       fondness for Navajo jewelry.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

                           JERRY
                     (gives him a look, then goes
                      back to reading)
                 Hi.

       A YOUNG WOMAN enters from the back of the store and goes
       to another counter.  Neither man notices.

                           ADAM
                 The name is Adam Webber and I see you
                 buy baseball cards and although these
                 are a lot older than the ones in the
                 window, I was hoping you still might
                 be interested.

       He flips open the cigar box to reveal to Jerry riches
       beyond his wildest dreams.  Jerry actually moans and then
       must pretend the moan was a cough.

                           JERRY
                 How--how much do you want for the
                 Mickey Mantle, rookie season?

                           ADAM
                 I was thinking of selling all the
                 cards.

                           JERRY
                 Really? No kidding?

       He reaches in and looks through the cards.

                           ADAM
                 See, my problem is, all I have are
                 hundred dollar bills and I need
                 something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens.
                 Like that.

                           JERRY
                 I see what ya mean. Tell you
                 what...I'll give you five hundred
                 dollars in small bills for the whole
                 box.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that would be wonderful!

                           JERRY
                 Well, we're here to help!

       A woman steps into the shot. She has come from the back
       of the store and her back is momentarily to us.

                           EVE (OC)
                 Oh, shit!

       Adam turns to her and is immediately awe struck. We
       reveal EVE RUSTOKOV. She tosses her lipstick into her
       purse. Eve works in the card shop and is on her way out.


                           JERRY
                 I'm workin' here, Evey-poo.  Don't
                 screw me up.


                           ADAM
                 Bon soir, mademoiselle!

                           EVE
                 Are you French?

                           ADAM
                 No.
                     (then, thinking fast)
                 I'm from out of town.
                     (then sensing the need for
                      further clarification)
                 I'm here on business.

                           EVE
                 Well, your business must not be sports
                 memorabilia, because this one Mantle
                 card right here--
                     (holds up a card)
                 --is worth six thousand dollars all by
                 its little self.


                           ADAM
                 Get out of here!

                           EVE
                 No, you get out of here.

       She closes his cigar box and gives it to him.




                           JERRY
                 Terrific...you're fired! You know
                 that?!



                           EVE
                 No, ferry--excuse me, Jerry, I quit.

       She walks back to the counter to get her coat.

                           JERRY
                 Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair
                 salon guy and the Chevy dealer!  You
                 know why you can't keep a goddamn
                 job?!  Because you can't keep your
                 goddamn mouth shut!  That's why!

       Jerry is surprised when Adam suddenly takes his arm
       firmly.

                           ADAM
                 Sir? I would really appreciate it if
                 you wouldn't take the Lord's name in
                 vain again.

                           JERRY
                     (looking at Adam's hand)
                 Oh, you got a problem with that?


                           ADAM
                 I have a big problem with that.

       Eve sees a fist fight coming. She takes Adam by the arm.



                           EVE
                 Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to
                 the corner.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.



                           EVE
                 Just come on.

       They head for the door and exit.

                           JERRY
                 Hah!  Adam and Eve!  The perfect
                 match!  I hope you two will be very
                 happy together!  Mazel-fuckin'-tov!
                 Don't try coming back, Ms. Big Shot!
                 I'm serious this time! You're finished
                 in the hobby business! Take that to
                 the bank, why don'tcha!

       Adam re-enters.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't want to leave without saying
                 how much I admire your jewelry.

                           JERRY
                 Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your
                 butt?

       Adam walks towards the man smiling.

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout you what?

       Jerry takes a nervous step backwards, but Eve steps back
       in and pulls Adam out.

                           EVE
                 I said come on!



       Adam exits. Jerry doesn't know what to say.

       EXT. CARD STORE - NIGHT

       They exit the store.

                           ADAM
                 Where are we going?

                           EVE
                 We? I'm going home. And, judging by
                 that coat, I'd say you have to get
                 back to the barber college.

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm lost.

                           EVE
                 You're lost?

                           ADAM
                 Say,...did you just lose your job
                 because of me?

                           EVE
                 Forget it.  I'm sick of working for
                 that dickhead.

                           ADAM
                 Dickhead?

                           EVE
                 A walking penis capable of intelligent
                 speech.  A dickhead.

       A mental picture of that causes Adam to slump against a
       store window and drop his box of cards.

                           EVE
                 What's wrong with you?

                           ADAM
                 I just had a mental picture of...

                           EVE
                 Here, pick these up!

       Together they pick up the cards.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Where are you parked?

                           ADAM
                 I came on a bus.

                           EVE
                 Why doesn't that surprise me?

                           ADAM
                 I don't know. Why doesn't it?

       They rise.

                           EVE
                 Well, I guess because I'm a little
                 psychic...I have this thing.

                           ADAM
                 Oh, that's nice.

                           EVE
                 Let me guess something. This is your
                 first visit to La La Land. You're
                 staying somewhere over in Hollywood
                 because, like an idiot, you thought
                 that would be an exciting place to
                 stay.  Right so far?



                           ADAM
                     (could be a question, could
                      be an answer.)
                 So far?

                           EVE
                 Yes, I'm right?

                           ADAM
                 Right.

                           EVE
                 I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus
                 and before you know it, you're out
                 here in the San Fernando Valley
                 without a clue.  Which brings us to
                 here.  Correct again?

                           ADAM
                 Again.

                           EVE
                 Where are you staying? The Holiday
                 Inn?

                           ADAM
                 Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's
                 exactly right!

                           EVE
                 See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but
                 pretty much. That was pretty good,
                 wasn't it?!

                           ADAM
                 It was amazing.

                           EVE
                 Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a
                 bus for you to get on.

                           ADAM
                 Do you own a car?

                           EVE
                 I'm not taking you there, Sweetie.
                 Rule Number One in North America: No
                 strangers in the car.

                           ADAM
                 If it will make you feel any better, I
                 don't have a gun.

                           EVE
                 You don't?

                           ADAM
                 Nope.

                           EVE
                 Well, that changes everything. Get the
                 fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!

       She races around the corner.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry!  I said something wrong,
                 didn't I!  Please forgive me!

                           EVE
                 Get away from me!!

       She runs into a parking lot.  He follows.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal
                 with you!  I'll give you a Rogers
                 Hornsby, if you'll take me to the
                 hotel!

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby?!?

                           ADAM
                 He's all yours. I was holding him
                 back.

       Adam takes a Hornsby card from his coat pocket and shows
       it to her.

                           EVE
                 Rogers Hornsby's worth like four
                 thousand dollars!

                           ADAM
                 So what?!  I've got two of him!
                 		(removing more cards from his
                 		 pocket)
                 And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons.
                 I was holding these out, too.

       She arrives at her car (dirty GEO) and anxiously unlocks
       the driver's door.

                           EVE
                 So for four thousand dollars, all I
                 have to do is drive you to your hotel?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 And that's it?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 I don't have to take a physical in
                 your space ship?

                           ADAM
                 Heck, no!  What?!

                           EVE
                 Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal.
                 Get in.

       She gets in. He gets in the back seat behind her.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 The front seat!

       He runs around to the front while Eve chats with herself.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Why am I doing this? What in the hell
                 is wrong with me? That's what I'd like
                 to know.



       SCENE 99 OMITTED



       EXT. HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY - MINUTES LATER

       Traffic is moving at fifteen miles an hour. The dash
       lights fascinate him but the car scares him.  She notices
       that he is gripping the seat belt for dear life.

                           EVE
                 So...Mister Andretti, your first time
                 on the freeway?

                           ADAM
                 It's Webber.  Adam Webber.

                           EVE
                 Mind if I change the station?
                 Better traffic reports on AM.

       She switches over to AM and runs by a Perry Como record,
       "Round and Round", looking for traffic.

                           ADAM
                 Wait!  Wait!

                           EVE
                 What is it?!

                           ADAM
                 It's Perry!

                           EVE
                 Perry?

                           ADAM
                 Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back!
                 Go back!

                           EVE
                 Okay, okay!  Take it easy!

       She gets Perry.

                           EVE
                 How's that?

                           ADAM
                     (star-struck)
                 Oh, I could die...

                           EVE
                 Over this?

                           ADAM
                 Yeah! Listen to this part. This is
                 where it really takes off!

                           EVE
                 You are one scary son-of-a-gun.




       EXT. FREEWAY

       Eve's car splits for the exit ramp.

       INT. EVE'S CAR

       The sudden speed scares Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, what are you doing?!

                           EVE
                 I know a short-cut.

       EXT. OFF RAMP

       She comes off, catches the light and whips onto the
       surface street, tires squealing.

       INT. CAR

       Adam is hanging onto his seat belt. Eve puts the pedal to
       the metal.

                           ADAM
                 Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!

                           EVE
                 I can't help it. Perry Como always
                 does this to me! I just get so
                 cranked!

       She turns Perry way up.

       EXT. AVENUE

       Eve does a dandy job of trading lanes and passing.  The
       little Geo's engine screams. Adam's sort of getting into
       it.

       EXT. HOLLYWOOD HOLIDAY INN - TEN MINUTES LATER

       The Geo flies up to a quick stop.

       INT. CAR

       Eve turns to Adam, who has had A Life Experience.

                           EVE
                 Card, please.  End of service.

       He hands over the card like someone in a post-sex stupor.

                           ADAM
                 That was...wonderful!  I've never felt
                 anything like that in my life.

                           EVE
                 Yeah, same here. Don't forget your
                 suitcase.

                           ADAM
                 Right.

       He gets out with the suitcase, and after shutting the
       door leans down to speak to her.

                           ADAM
                 You know--

       She tears off, leaving him there.

       INT. HOTEL REGISTRATION - MINUTES LATER

       Adam addresses the clerk.

                           ADAM
                 Good evening. I want to stay at this
                 hotel.

                           CLERK
                 Fill this out please. And I'll need a
                 card.

                           ADAM
                 A card?

                           CLERK
                 Yes, sir.

                           ADAM
                 Of course!

       Adam gives him a baseball card.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER SAME NIGHT

       A BELLBOY ushers Adam in and sets down his bag.

                           BELLBOY
                 Bathroom's there, TV's over there.
                 Remote's on top. Room Service menu is
                 on the table.

       Adam picks up the phone and listens.


                           BELLBOY (CONT'D)
                 You dial nine to get out.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 Of what?

                           BELLBOY
                     (beat, then)
                 The hotel.

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then he hangs up)
                 I see.  Well, thank you very much.
                 You've been very, very nice.

       He offers two dollars.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 I was able to get some change
                 downstairs and my father taught me
                 that it's customary to tip in a
                 situation such as this.

                           BELLBOY
                 Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.

                           ADAM
                 My father is a genius.

                           BELLBOY
                 No kiddin'. Well...good night.

                           ADAM
                 Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let
                 the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom
                 always says...
                 		(choking up)
                 ...who I'm really beginning to miss.
                 I'm sorry.  It's my first night away
                 from home.

                           BELLBOY
                 How old are you?

                           ADAM
                 Thirty-five.

                           BELLBOY
                 You don't look thirty-five.

                           ADAM
                 How old do I look?

                           BELLBOY
                 Twenty-five? Around there.

                           ADAM
                 I guess living up here makes people
                 look older.

                           BELLBOY
                 Up here on the fifteenth floor?

                           ADAM
                     (catching himself)
                 Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
                 Goodnight.

                           BELLBOY
                 Goodnight.

       Adam abruptly shuts the door in the man's face.
       He goes to the window and looks out. The height scares
       him to death. He jumps back.



       INT. SHELTER, DINNER TABLE - SAME TIME

       Adam's parents pray.

                           CALVIN
                 And Lord we ask finally that you send
                 an angel to look after and protect our
                 beloved son, Adam.  Amen.

                           HELEN
                 Amen.

       She begins to tear up and he pats her hand.

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAWN

       Adam sits by the window watching his first dawn.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - MORNING

       It's another bright, smoggy day.  And here comes Eve,
       marching from the parking garage to the hotel entrance.

                           EVE
                     (skyward)
                 What in the hell am I doing here?!
                 That's what I'd like to know! Somebody
                 tell me that.

       INT. FRONT DESK - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve is speaking to a DESK CLERK.

                           DESK CLERK
                 You don't have a last name?

                           EVE
                 All I know is that his first name is
                 Adam.  No!  Adam Webber!  That's it.

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       He is seated on the bed, transfixed, watching a
       television commercial.The PHONE RINGS loudly.  Adam
       nearly jumps out of his skin.  After he figures out where
       the ringing is coming from, he answers the phone.

                           ADAM
                     (into phone, after a long
                      pause)
                 Yes?

       INT. LOBBY

       At the house phone.

                           EVE
                     (into phone)
                 Hi. This is the woman from the
                 baseball card store.  Remember me?

       INT. ADAM'S ROOM

       Boy, is he glad to hear from her!

                           ADAM
                 Yes!  Hello!  Hi!  Hot-diggity-dog!
                 Thank you for calling me on the
                 telephone!!

       INT. LOBBY

       Eve holds the receiver away from her for a moment.

                           EVE
                 Good grief. Hey listen, I'm in the
                 lobby.
                     (pause, then)
                 On the first floor! Where the hell
                 else would it be?


       INT. LOBBY, ELEVATORS - MOMENTS LATER

       The doors open and Adam hurries out, looking for Eve, who
       he sees and goes directly to, smiling all the while like
       a rumpled idiot.

                           ADAM
                 I am so glad to see you!!  I thought
                 I'd never see you again!

                           EVE
                 Okay, down boy. (holds up the baseball
                 card) I can't take this for driving
                 you home. I wish I could, but I can't.
                 So here, take it back. I could have
                 just left it for you at the desk, but
                 it's very valuable. Now take it.

                           ADAM
                 I can't, it's yours.

                           EVE
                 Take it. damn it!

                           ADAM
                     (with hand over his mouth)
                 Okay.

       He takes the card.

                           EVE
                 Why are you doing that?

                           ADAM
                 I haven't brushed yet.

                           EVE
                 Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your
                 visit.


       She heads for the front door.  He goes after her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.

                           EVE
                 Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!

       EXT. HOTEL - DAY

       They exit.

                           EVE
                 I knew this would happen!  You're like
                 a lost puppy!

                           ADAM
                 Can't you please just talk to me for
                 one second?

                           EVE
                 Okay!  Damn!

       She stops, he stops.

                           EVE (CONT'D)
                 I should have taken the money and run!
                 That's what Troy told me to do!  But
                 do I listen?  No! Put your hand down!

       He does.

                           ADAM
                 Troy? Is he your husband? Or a
                 boyfriend?

                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                     (eyes to heaven)
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know
                 you like me.  I can tell. But you know
                 what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me,
                 exactly. It's more like the legs or
                 the butt or the hair.  Or some
                 combination of the above.

                           ADAM
                 I think it's the eyes.

                           EVE
                 The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow,
                 it never works out.  Okay?  Not that
                 you even need to know that!  You look
                 like crap, by the way.  What have you
                 been doing?

                           ADAM
                 Watching television in color.

                           EVE
                 Hey, no kidding?  In color?

                           ADAM
                 Cross my heart and hope to die.

       She looks at him for a beat or two, then abruptly turns
       away.

                           EVE
                 See, ya.

                           ADAM
                 Why doesn't it never work out?

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Why does it never work out?  You
                 and...men?

                           EVE
                 Why?!  Who the hell knows?!

       He follows closely. She stops.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 Okay, if you promise to leave me
                 alone, I'll tell you.

                           ADAM
                 ...Okay.

                           EVE
                 It never works out because I'm into
                 legs and butts and hair myself!
                 That's why! So I wind up with guys who
                 are very good looking, but
                 even more shallow than I am, if you
                 can picture that.
                 Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go
                 find another low-paying, demeaning job
                 where some guy named Jerry keeps
                 telling me how lousy his marriage is.

                           ADAM
                 Why not go to work for me?

                           EVE
                 Doing what?

                           ADAM
                 Selling all my baseball cards.
                 And helping me buy enough food and
                 supplies to fill several large trucks.

                           EVE
                 Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like
                 starving people?


                           ADAM
                 Well, they're not starving yet, but
                 they need help.

                           EVE
                 How long would you need me?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 What's the pay?

                           ADAM
                 What's fair?

                           EVE
                 I've got to make at least a thousand a
                 week.

       He gives her his patented thumbs up sign which of course
       is exactly like his father's.

                           ADAM
                 You got it!
                 Wait here while I change.

                           EVE
                 Sure.

       He walks back to the hotel.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 My career's finally taking off...

       EXT. MARINE WHOLESALE SUPPLY, MARINA DEL REY - DAY

       Heavy-duty BOAT BATTERIES are being loaded into a U-Haul
       truck.  The store MANAGER steps up to Eve who is
       watching. Adam appears in the bg, thanking and being nice
       to the MEN loading the truck. He looks mighty stupid in
       another one of his Dad's old outfits.

                           MANAGER
                 Why would someone need twenty yacht
                 batteries?

                           EVE
                 I just work for the guy.

                           MANAGER
                 And who does he work for?  The CIA?

                           EVE
                 Naw...it's some sort of charity
                 thing..I guess for starving people
                 with yachts.



       INT. PRICE CLUB - LATER SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam shop with two carts, both full of CASES OF
       DR. PEPPER.

                           EVE
                 Why not buy them milk or something--
                 instead of Dr. Pepper?

                           ADAM
                 They like Dr. Pepper.

                           EVE
                 Who are these people?

                           ADAM
                 My Mom and Dad.

                           EVE
                 Very funny, smart ass.

                           ADAM
                 Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need
                 all of this! This is swell!

       He goes over to a huge supply of Prince Albert.

                           EVE
                     (to herself)
                 Swell? Run, Eve.  Run.

       EXT. LOADING DOCK - SAME DAY

       Eve and Adam watch as a man with a forklift puts a year's
       supply of toilet paper into the back of the rental truck.

       EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - SAME DAY

       A crowd has gathered to watch Adam and Eve empty seven
       shopping carts full of non-perishable groceries.

       ANGLE - 5 MINUTES LATER

       Eve goes to get into the truck. Adam hurries by her.

                           ADAM
                 Wait! Wait!

                           EVE
                 What?

       He opens the door for her. She shakes her head and gets
       in.

       EXT. HOLIDAY INN - THAT NIGHT

       She drives the truck to a stop. He keeps the beat to the
       song on the AM radio. It's VolarÈ. Adam loves it. Eve
       hates it. They come to a stop and she snaps off the
       radio.


                           EVE
                 Well, another day, another dollar.
                     (then)
                 Stop staring at me!!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry.

       He gets out.

                           EVE
                 Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, you know. I was thinking...

                           EVE
                 Night!

       She pulls away.

                           ADAM
                 Night!

       EXT./INT. U-STORE-IT - NEXT DAY

       Adam drags the last 50-pound bag of flour into a self-
       storage locker and pulls down the sliding door which he
       padlocks.

                           ADAM
                 We'll have to rent a refrigerated
                 truck for the beef and poultry.

                           EVE
                 It's your life.  And, by the way, it's
                 a dandy.

                           ADAM
                 I guess we'll need another locker.

                           EVE
                 No problem.  We'll just sell another
                 baseball card.

                           ADAM
                 You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? -
                 -  but, I'd just be lost without you.



                           EVE
                 Thank you.

                           ADAM
                 And, um ...I guess...
                 I guess you and I, uh...

                           EVE
                 Adam?  Don't even think about it.
                 Okay?
                 I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean,
                 but believe me, it would be meaner if
                 I didn't say it. Okay?

                           ADAM
                 Okay.

                           EVE
                 Now, let's take the truck back and get
                 something to eat.

       She hops in behind the wheel.  He (hurt) is a little
       slower getting in his side.

       EXT. FREEWAY - LATER, SAME DAY

       Traffic is moving about forty miles an hour.  Their truck
       is in one of the middle lanes.

       INT. U-HAUL - CONTINUOUS

       Adam screws up his guts and turns to her.

                           ADAM
                 There's something else I would like
                 you to help me with.

                           EVE
                 Name it.

                           ADAM
                 Well, this is going to sound a little
                 crazy.

                           EVE
                     (laughing)
                 Oh, I'm sure it will!

                           ADAM
                 Then forget it.

                           EVE
                 No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?

                           ADAM
                 This is for me.

                           EVE
                 Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.


                           ADAM
                 Well... Okay. I would like you to help
                 me find a...wife.

                           EVE
                 A wife?

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 What for?

                           ADAM
                 Because I want to get married.

                           EVE
                 Why?!

                           ADAM
                 I don't want to be alone.

                           EVE
                 You can be single and not alone.
                 Marriage bites!

                           ADAM
                 Bites what?

                           EVE
                 The big one!

                           ADAM
                 It does?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 I didn't know that.

                           EVE
                 Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced
                 sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and
                 dad.

                           ADAM
                 They're all divorced?

                           EVE
                 Everybody's divorced.

                           ADAM
                 It didn't used to be that way.

                           EVE
                 I wouldn't know.
                     (then)
                 What kind of wife are you looking for?

                           ADAM
                 One who's not a mutant.

                           EVE
                 No dogs, huh? Okay.

                           ADAM
                 And if possible, I'd like to marry
                 someone from Pasadena.

       She is speechless. Then:

                           EVE
                 When do you need her by?

                           ADAM
                 Two weeks.

                           EVE
                 Well, I could probably get you laid in
                 two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant
                 wife from Pasadena...that could take
                 some
                 time.

                           ADAM
                 That's what I was afraid of.


       INT. DINER - LATER, SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve are in a booth. The WAITRESS approaches with
       sandwiches and drinks.

                           ADAM
                 What do you mean, you can get me laid?

       He and the waitress look to Eve for an answer.

                           EVE
                 Could we talk about that a little
                 later?

                           ADAM
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                     (sugary, to waitress)
                 Thank you.

       The amazed waitress leaves.  Adam automatically lowers
       his head and says grace.  Two HAPPENIN' GUYS at the
       counter look over and chuckle at the rube.  Eve flips
       them a mean bird and mouths the words "fuck you" as Adam
       continues to pray. The guys shut up.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY

       Eve shares a frame Santa Monica bungalow.  It's in a
       pretty nice neighborhood on a quiet street.  Her GEO
       FISHTAILS into the picture and comes to rest half in the
       street, half on the curb.  Adam is driving.

                           EVE
                 Get out!

                           ADAM
                 The engine is still running.

       She rips the keys out of the ignition.

                           EVE
                 Now, get out!!

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am!

                           EVE
                 Stop that ma'am crap!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry!

       They get out.

                           EVE
                 You almost got us killed!

                           ADAM
                 I told you I've never driven before!

                           EVE
                 Never drive again!

                           ADAM
                 You said it would be easy!

                           EVE
                 I was wrong!!

                           ADAM
                 Is this your house?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           ADAM
                 I like it.

       She storms off for the house where a YOUNG MAN is coming
       out the front door in a cut-off T-shirt and spandex
       exercise shorts.

                           EVE
                 Swell!


       EXT. PORCH

       CLIFF is leaving with a cardboard box full of clothes.
       He is exceedingly GOOD LOOKING AND IN VERY GOOD SHAPE.
       Eve and Adam come up the steps.

                           CLIFF
                 What are you bitching about now?

                           EVE
                 What are you doing here?

                           CLIFF
                 I forgot some of my stuff.

                           EVE
                 Your stuff?  Let me see that.

       She looks in the box.  Holds up a pair of old briefs.

                           EVE
                 You came back for these?

                           CLIFF
                 Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's
                 this interesting looking fellow?

                           EVE
                 This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.

                           ADAM
                     (offering hand)
                 How do you do?

                           CLIFF
                 I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?
                 		(eyeing Eve)
                 You doin' any good?

                           EVE
                 Go home, Cliff, wherever that might
                 be.

                           CLIFF
                 Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember
                 her?  The model who went to Harvard?
                 Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam.
                 Nice coat!

       Cliff smiles and bounces down the steps.

                           ADAM
                 Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met
                 you, Cliff!
                 		(then to her)
                 May I ask you a question?

                           EVE
                 He's a former boyfriend. We lived
                 together for about six months.  And
                 yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind
                 of got a thing for him.
                     (entering the house)
                 That's what you wanted to know, isn't
                 it?

                           ADAM
                     (following)
                 Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff
                 likes to wear another man's
                 underpants.

                           EVE
                     (OC)
                 What?!

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       Very good music is playing. Adam listens to one speaker
       then crosses to listen to the other. Then he goes back to
       the first.

       INT.EVE'S KITCHEN - SAME TIME

       Eve is pouring champagne into a glass that contains two
       sugar cubes.  Next she adds several dashes of bitters.
       TROY, HER GAY ROOMMATE, throws together a tray of
       appetizers as dinner cooks on the stove.


                           TROY
                     (sotto)
                 Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!

                           EVE
                 I knew you'd like him.

                           TROY
                 Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think
                 about it!  The guy's got all this
                 easily negotiable property. He's
                 obviously setting something up very
                 big.  Like a self-sustaining island
                 off the coast of South America, for
                 instance. Or perhaps he's the head of
                 a cult that's doing weird things with
                 poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard
                 worse.

       He rushes out with the tray.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters with sushi appetizers. Adam is looking at the
       ceiling.

                           ADAM
                 You have very nice ceilings.

                           TROY
                 I do? Well, thank you! You like
                 ceilings?

                           ADAM
                 Not particularly.

                           TROY
                 Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea
                 urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori"
                 if you prefer. I love sushi.

                           ADAM
                 I love Lucy!

                           TROY
                 You nut!

       Eve enters with Adam's drink and two white wines.

       .

                           EVE
                 Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

                           EVE
                 I thought only hookers drank those
                 things.

                           ADAM
                 Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!

       Eve and Troy look at each other as she hands him his
       wine.

                           TROY
                 Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don't
                 we sit and chat.

       They do.



                           TROY
                 So, Adam...where on earth are you
                 from?

                           EVE
                 Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.

                           ADAM
                 It's a very small place. People don't
                 even know it's there.

                           TROY
                 And it's called...?

                           ADAM
                 Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.

                           TROY
                 Really?  Since when?

                           EVE
                     (defensive)
                 Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
                 Springs.

                           TROY
                 Oh, yes.

                           EVE
                 I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?

                           ADAM
                 Right on the button.

                           TROY
                 Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home
                 town.

                           EVE
                 Give me your hand.

                           TROY
                     (to himself)
                 Oh, my God...

       Adam holds out his hand and she takes it, rubbing her
       finger slowly and gently around in his palm.  For her,
       it's psychic stuff.  For him, it's spine-tingling.

                           EVE
                 Okay, let's see...I'm not promising
                 anything. You okay?

                           ADAM
                 Um-hum.

                           EVE
                 I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow.
                 Way up North.  Are we getting hot?

                           ADAM
                 Yes!

                           EVE
                 You live in...Alaska.  The only way in
                 or out of your place is by plane
                 and... you've definitely come down
                 here for food and supplies and... to
                 find a wife!

                           ADAM
                 Wow.

       She tosses back his hand and grabs her wine for a victory
       gulp.

                           TROY
                 That's right?

                           ADAM
                     (to Eve)
                 I've never met anyone like you in my
                 life.

                           TROY
                 She's right?!

                           EVE
                 Hey, butthead, I'm clairvoyant.


                           ADAM
                 I've got goose-bumps all over me.

                           TROY
                 Why not just go to... Nome for
                 supplies and a wife?  Isn't that
                 closer?

                           EVE
                 Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to
                 find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the
                 way.

                           ADAM
                 Good for you.

                           TROY
                 Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask
                 you a few questions.  When did Alaska
                 become a state?

                           ADAM
                 1959.

                           TROY
                 Who use to own it?

                           ADAM
                 Russia.

                           TROY
                 When did we get it from them?

                           ADAM
                 1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2
                 million dollars for it. A tidy sum
                 then, as well as now. I'm quoting my
                 father, of course.

                           TROY
                 What's the capitol?

                           ADAM
                 Juneau.

                           TROY
                 Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!

                           ADAM
                 Sorry, that's the largest city.

       Troy jumps up and runs out of the room.

                           ADAM
                 Where's he gone?

                           EVE
                 He's gone to check your answers on his
                 computer.

                           ADAM
                 He has a computer?

                           EVE
                 Sure.

                           ADAM
                 In the house?

                           EVE
                 No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of
                 course, in the house.  It's in there.

                           ADAM
                 May I please be excused?

                           EVE
                 Uh...yeah.

       TROY'S OFFICE

       He has "Alaska" on his computer screen.  Adam enters and
       looks at the computer, which captivates him.

                           ADAM
                 This must be very new.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 It's so small.

                           TROY
                 What are you talking about? This is
                 the new Mac. You a hacker?

                           ADAM
                 I don't think so.

                           TROY
                 You don't have a computer in your
                 cabin?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           TROY
                 How do you get through those winters?
                 		(reading screen)
                 Well, you're right.  Juneau.
                 		(then, covering the
                 		 screen with his hand)
                 What's the highest peak?

                           ADAM
                 Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest
                 point in North America.

                           TROY
                     (after peeking at the screen)
                 Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go
                 eat!

                           ADAM
                     (indicating computer)
                 That would knock my father out.

                           TROY
                 Yeah?

                           ADAM
                 Oh, yes.
                     (to himself)
                 It would probably kill him.

                           TROY
                 He's a Windows guy then, huh?

                           ADAM
                 Yes. He likes windows.

                           TROY
                 Well, I think Windows stink. What do
                 you think of that?

                           ADAM
                 ...I guess it's...just a matter of
                 personal taste.

                           TROY
                 True.

       Troy exits. Adam follows.


       (EDITORIAL:  Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene
       134 rather than precede it.)








       INT. SHELTER, MASTER BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       Calvin Webber is sleeping soundly.  Helen stands quietly
       at the door looking at him. She finishes off her
       champagne cocktail and very quietly shuts the door.

       INT. ANTEROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Helen goes into the elevator. Obviously, she's had too
       much to drink.

       INT. MALT SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

       The floor rumbles and the metal doors open emitting the
       red light.  Soda Jerk and TEN OF HIS FOLLOWERS stand up
       expectantly and anxiously.  Helen appears--and looks at
       this terribly odd assortment of people.

                           SODA JERK
                 Who are you?!

                           HELEN
                     (beat, then)
                 I'm the mother.

                           SODA JERK
                 It's the mother!!

       And they all fall down on their knees and worship her
       with much wailing and rejoicing.  Several speak in
       tongues. Helen stares at them wide-eyed, presses the
       button on the control box, and goes back down.


       INT. DINING TABLE - NIGHT

       Adam's impeccable table manners serve to highlight Eve's
       and Troy's utter lack of same.

                           TROY
                 But first, you have to start with the
                 clothes!

                           EVE
                 Exactly.
                 		(then to Adam)
                 You understand that, don't you?  You
                 have no chance of meeting a woman
                 dressed like that.

                           ADAM
                 All right.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 So, what are you seeing?

                           TROY
                     (looking Adam over)
                 I don't know.

                           EVE
                 Money is no object.  He's got cards up
                 the wazoo.

                           ADAM
                 The what?

                           EVE
                 Wazoo!  Try to listen.
                     (then to Troy)
                 Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip-
                 hop, Euro trash?

                           TROY
                 You're serious, aren't you?

                           EVE
                 What's that supposed to mean?

                           TROY
                 It means that your taste in men's
                 apparel is as bad as your taste in
                 men.

                           EVE
                 Well, that's blunt!

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.

                           EVE
                 And I suppose you see him in some sort
                 of strapless  thing, don't you?

                           TROY
                 I see "elegant."

                           EVE
                 Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?

                           TROY
                 That's what I'm sensing.

                           ADAM
                 The guy with the underpants!

                           EVE
                 That's boring!

                           TROY
                     (indicating Adam)
                 Not on him.

                           ADAM
                 I'm not wearing his pants.

                           TROY
                 Why not? He has great pants.

                           ADAM
                 I just don't want to.

                           TROY
                 Okay.

                           EVE

                 Why don't you take him and pick out
                 his clothes?

                           TROY
                 Alright, I will.

                           EVE
                     (talking with her mouth full)
                 I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to
                 buy six thousand paper napkins.

                           TROY
                 What do you think, Adam?

                           ADAM
                 About clothing?

                           EVE
                 Yeah.

                           ADAM
                 Whatever you two want. If you've got
                 the time, I've got the wazoo.

       Eve and Troy watch him eat for a beat or two.

                           TROY
                 Isn't it a little tiring to sit up
                 straight like that?

                           ADAM
                 No.

                           EVE
                 What about holding your right arm up
                 like that all the time?

                           ADAM
                 It's fine. Just give it a try.
                 And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot
                 off the chair!

       She does. Eve and Troy emulate Adam.

       SCENE 136 OMITTED



       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - DAY

       Troy and Adam get out of Eve's car with a lot of
       packages. They head for the house.

                           ADAM
                 I guess a lot of those tall buildings
                 we saw this morning are new.

                           TROY
                 Almost all of them.

                           ADAM
                 The recovery is very impressive.

                           TROY
                 The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they
                 rebuilt the freeway in six months.

                           ADAM
                 Amazing. I'm very impressed.



       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - SAME DAY

       Eve is on the couch doing her toenails when Adam and Troy
       enter. Adam is in a casually elegant outfit that looks
       terrific. Both he and Troy are carrying lots of other
       packages and garment bags. We see names like Gucci,
       Armani and Lauren. Eve is visibly impressed by Adam's
       makeover.

                           TROY
                 Well, what do you think?

                           EVE
                 I think...it...works.

                           TROY
                 Let me show you the entire trousseau!

                           ADAM
                 But first let me show her these!

       He reaches into a bag and removes a box that contains --
       a pair of rollerblades.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 Eve, can I skate around your block?

                           TROY
                     (making it sexual)
                 How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around
                 your block?

                           EVE
                     (beat, then)
                 No.

       SCENE 137A OMITTED

       SCENE 137B OMITTED

       SCENE 138 OMITTED




       EXT. VENICE BEACH - LATER, SAME DAY

       There is a most unusual band shell location on the beach
       that is completely covered by graffiti. Eve and Troy sit
       at one of the many stone tables watching Adam skate all
       over the place. He wears spandex workout pants and a T-
       shirt.



       The starting CRANE SHOT begins on the nearly deserted
       commercial section of Venice Beach and then takes us to
       the band shell.

       ANGLE - CLOSER

       of him skating and them watching.

                           EVE
                 He's going to kill himself.
                     (then, to Adam)
                 Go skate out on the bike path! It's
                 that way!

                           ADAM
                 Okay!

       He heads out of the band shell. We follow him as he
       skates into an area that has been given over to the
       homeless. They sit around in their sleeping bags and
       blankets and cheer (and jeer) Adam when he passes by. He
       takes them to be more mutants.

       EXT. BIKE PATH - CONTINUOUS

       Adam skates to it and is amazed to see two very pretty
       girls skating in their tiny bikinis. A nearly nude body-
       builder guy goes by on a bike. Then Adam sees the ocean.

       ANGLE - WAVES

       breaking on the beach and rocks.

       EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS

       Adam tosses off his roller-blades and walks trance-like
       towards the waves.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       appear on a dune behind him and watch.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Adam raises his arms to greet the ocean, perhaps like a
       Plains Indian would. Then he joyously runs into the surf
       and dives.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

                           EVE
                 That water's freezing!

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       He surfaces and throws his fists in the air.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

                           TROY
                 That's why little things mean so much
                 to him.

       ANGLE - ADAM

                           ADAM
                 I LOVE THIS!!

       Begin the record "YMCA" over this.

       INT. EVE'S LIVING ROOM - NEXT DAY

       Eve enters from her morning shower to find Troy and Adam
       goofing to The Village People song. She gives Troy a
       disapproving look.

                           TROY
                     (defensive)
                 What?! He wanted to hear some
                 standards!

       (My hip daughters tell me that "YMCA" is enjoying a huge
       rebirth of popularity at their parties. Apparently they
       line dance to it.)

       EXT. FREEWAY - SAME DAY

       A helicopter shot follows the U-Haul in traffic.
       (Continue music.)

       EXT. SELF-STORAGE - SAME DAY

       Adam and Eve fill a second storage site. (Continue
       music.)

       EXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND, PUBLIC PARK  - DAY

       We see the infield of a gay softball team wheel a double
       play.

       ANGLE - TROY AND ADAM

       Cheering the play with other gay fans.

                           ADAM
                 I get it! I finally get it! You have
                 to see it to understand it!

       Music ends.



       INT. EVE'S KITCHEN - NEXT DAY (RAIN)

       She looks out the back window at the rain and shakes her
       head. She exits the back door with an umbrella.

       EXT. EVE'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

       Eve hurries to Adam who is sitting on a lawn chair in the
       middle of the small back yard, enjoying the rain. She
       holds the umbrella over her head.

                           ADAM
                 Hey, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Have you ever heard the saying, "He
                 hasn't got enough sense to come in out
                 of the rain?"

                           ADAM
                 Yep.
                     (then watching the rain hit
                      the palm of his hand)
                 You know, my father -- who is a
                 scientist -- says that everything is a
                 miracle. Everything. Until recently I
                 wasn 't sure what he meant by that.

                           EVE
                 Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still
                 want to go girl hunting tonight?

                           ADAM
                 I certainly do!

                           EVE
                 Okay. But you know, this business of
                 finding you a wife -- it's kind of
                 ridiculous, don't you think?

                           ADAM
                     (rising)
                 No it's not!

                           EVE
                 Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a
                 wife? I mean...

                           ADAM
                 Then just help me find a girlfriend!
                 That's all I ask.
                 I'll give you every single card I've
                 got left!

                           EVE
                 Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm
                 just somebody you can buy off! Listen,
                 let me tell you something--

                           ADAM
                     (taking her by the arms)
                 Would you do it just because you're my
                 friend? My very best friend.

                           EVE
                 Well...yeah. Okay.

       He hugs her.

                           ADAM
                 Thank Q, Eve!

       She's uncomfortable with the hug. Wait a minute. No she's
       not.

       EXT. "THE FORTIES" NIGHT CLUB - SAME NIGHT

       This hip, up-market club is based on a 1940's theme.
       Establish the YOUTHFUL RICH arriving in their black four-
       wheel vehicles and silver Porsches. Coats and ties. Eve,
       Troy and Adam arrive on foot. Adam notices the valet
       parking.

                           ADAM
                 Why did you park way back there?

                           TROY
                 Miss Rustokov refuses to let total
                 strangers drive her car.

                           ADAM
                 Oh. I see.

       Eve looks like she owns the place.

       INT. NIGHT CLUB ANTEROOM - SAME TIME

       As they enter Adam grabs Troy, who is leading the way.

                           TROY
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 Ladies first, Troy! That was close.

       Adam and Troy follow Eve in. The club is NOISY AND
       HOPPING. The house music is from the 40's. Adam, Eve and
       Troy enter a long corridor of booths and walk forward.
       Adam's got on that terrific dark suit. Women notice. Eve
       notices them noticing.

                           ADAM
                 My goodness gracious!  This place is
                 something!

                           EVE
                 Look unimpressed.

                           TROY
                 Bored even.

       Adam gives it a shot and goes too bored.

                           TROY
                 Vaguely bored!

       He gets vaguely bored but misses unimpressed by a mile.

                           EVE
                 Unimpressed, but still interested.

       He tries that. It's like watching a neon sign switch back
       and forth:  First interested, then not.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not crazy!

                           ADAM
                 Do I look crazy?

                           EVE
                 Yes!

                           TROY
                 Be loose.

       He overplays that.

                           EVE
                 Just be yourself.

                           TROY
                 Always good advice.

                           EVE
                 For him. It doesn't work for the rest
                 of us.

                           ADAM
                 Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place
                 is neat-o!!

       Adam enters the main room. Eve and Troy follow.



       INT. MAIN ROOM

       There is a bar, a seated section, and a dance floor with
       a DJ booth. The DJ is in a white dinner jacket and does a
       perfect Humphrey Bogart impression as he ad libs his
       speel between records.

       ANGLE - BAR

       JASON and JONATHAN wave when they see Eve and Troy
       approaching. They ad-lib hellos. Here, and at the tables,
       the recorded MUSIC IS SO LOUD THEY MUST SPEAK OVER IT.

                           EVE
                 Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam,
                 that's them!

       They shake.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?! It's very nice to meet
                 you, Jason and Jonathan!
                     (confidentially, to them)
                 My mother always told me that if you
                 meet a person for the first time it's
                 easier to remember their names if you
                 use those names right away.

       Jason and Jonathan just stare at him.

                           TROY
                 He's from Alaska!

                           JASON/JONATHAN
                     (relieved)
                 Oh!

       A slightly drunk beauty named SOPHIE appears behind Eve.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi, there, Eve, who's the hunk?

       Eve hates Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Get lost, Sophie.

       Sophie pushes her way right up to Adam.

                           SOPHIE
                 Hi. I'm Sophie.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Sophie, I'm Adam Webber.

                           JASON
                 Adam lives in Alaska.

                           SOPHIE
                 No shit?

                           ADAM
                 Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon
                 accent.

                           SOPHIE
                 You speak beautiful French!
                 J'ai habitÈ a Paris un an.

                           ADAM
                 Paris!! La ville de lumieres!
                 C'est bien rencontrer quelqu'un pour
                 pratiquer le francais.

                           SOPHIE
                 Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer
                 beaucoup des choses ensemble.


       Eve steps in and takes Adam's hand, drawing him away from
       Sophie.

                           EVE
                 Quit showing off!  We're here on
                 business!

                           ADAM
                 Good-bye!

                           SOPHIE
                 Non, cherie. A bientot.

       Eve leads Adam to a table. Troy follows.

                           ADAM
                 I thought I was here to meet women.

                           EVE
                 Not that one!

                           ADAM
                 I like her.

                           EVE
                 And don't be so obvious!

       INT. TABLE - TEN MINUTES LATER

       Adam, Eve and Troy examine female patrons over drinks.
       It's white wine for her, imported beer for Troy, and a
       Rob Roy for Adam.

                           EVE
                 What have you ordered?

                           ADAM
                 It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink,
                 I'm told.

       ANGLE - LOVELY BRUNETTE

       slinking by.

       ANGLE - TABLE

                           ADAM (OC)
                 What about her?

                           EVE (OC)
                 No way.

                           ADAM
                 Why?!  I think she's very attractive.

                           EVE
                 Adam!  She's got bitch written all
                 over her!  You do know what "bitch"
                 means, don't you?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't
                 understand for the life of me why you
                 would call her that!  Or why Cliff
                 would say that about you.

                           EVE
                 Because we're bitches!  Look at her!
                 Look at the expression on her face!
                 The walk, the jewelry, the
                 fingernails.  Please!

                           ADAM
                 How 'bout this one?

       "This one" is a KILLER BLOND.

                           EVE
                 Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even
                 be a crumb on her table!  You don't
                 see that?!

                           TROY
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's
                 nothing personal.

                           TROY
                 Adam,  I think for you, we should go
                 for "sweet."

                           ADAM
                 Okay. I like that.

                           EVE
                     (swigging her drink)
                 Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of
                 putting it.

                           ADAM
                     (to Troy)
                 What do I say to Miss Sweet when I
                 meet her?

                           TROY
                 Um... Eve?

                           EVE
                 It's not so much what you say but how
                 you say it.  Women like men who are
                 unpredictable.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           EVE
                 Yes, really! Basically, they want what
                 they think they can't have.  Same with
                 guys.  That's why everybody is walking
                 around here sending off "you can't
                 have me" signals!

       ANGLE OF MEN AND WOMEN

       doing precisely that. Then:

       BACK TO TABLE

                           ADAM
                 That's ridiculous.

                           EVE
                 Maybe. But that's how it works.

                           TROY
                 Ah-ha! There's " Miss Sweet."  At the
                 hors d'oeuvres table!

       INTERCUT - MISS SWEET

       She's a pretty young thing with a sweet face.

                           EVE
                 Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo.
                 Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.

                           ADAM
                     (very serious)
                 Okay. All right.
                     (then)
                 And what do I say?

                           EVE
                 Say something surprising. And funny.
                 Lie, if need be.

                           TROY
                 Yes! Lying is always a very effective
                 dating tool.

                           ADAM
                 Okay. Thank you, my friends.

       Adam rises.

                           ADAM (cont'd)
                 By the way, that's a great play.

                           EVE
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.

                           EVE
                 Did you?

       Adam nods and shoves off.

                           TROY
                 I'm not sure I want to watch this.

       Eve puts her hand to her head -- hating herself and still
       not  sure exactly why.

       ANGLE - ADAM

       crossing to Miss Sweet.

                           ADAM
                     (to himself)
                 Surprising and funny. Well, I know a
                 duck who bought some lip balm...

       INT. HORS D'OEUVRES TABLE

       Adam sheepishly approaches Miss Sweet, then gathers
       himself:

                           ADAM
       Hi!

                           MISS SWEET
                     (not sweet)
                 Yes?

                           ADAM
                     (beat, then)
                 I was wondering if you might help me.
                 I...I seem to have lost my
                 Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere
                 around here.

       Miss Sweet stares at him for a beat or two, then
       chuckles.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Oh, now, that's a great one!

                           ADAM
                     (big smile)
                 You like it?

                           MISS SWEET
                     (a little clap)
                 Bravo!

                           ADAM
                 Thank-Q!

       They both laugh.

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       Stunned...as they watch Adam and Miss Sweet. Another
       pretty young woman (HEATHER) joins Adam.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND GIRLS

       Heather is a friend of Miss Sweet's.

                           MISS SWEET
                 This is my new friend...

                           ADAM
                 I'm Adam Webber.

                           MISS SWEET
                 He's really funny!

                           HEATHER
                 Hi!  I'm Heather!

                           ADAM
                 "Heather?"  I don't believe I've ever
                 heard that name before.

       There's a slight beat before both girls laugh.

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah, right!

                           MISS SWEET
                 I told you!  He's funny!

       ANGLE - EVE AND TROY

       More stunned. Eve finds that she very much hates watching
       Adam having a good time with other healthy non-mutants.

       ANGLE - ADAM AND HIS NEW FRIENDS

                           MISS SWEET
                 We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're
                 both professional dancers.

                           ADAM
                 Really?

                           HEATHER
                 You dance?

                           ADAM
                 I took a dance lesson everyday of my
                 life until a couple of days ago.

                           MISS SWEET
                 You're kidding!

                           ADAM
                 No, I'm not! My mom taught me.

                           MISS SWEET
                 Your mom was a dancer?

                           ADAM
                 She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You
                 would like her very much! Shall we
                 dance?

                           MISS SWEET
                 Sure.


       They head for the dance floor.

       ANGLE - TROY AND EVE

       watching.

       ANGLE - THE FLOOR

       A jitterbug song comes on and so does Adam.



       He and Miss Sweet are a little rough on take-off, but
       they hit smooth sailing soon enough. He's terrific at
       picking up the new stuff she shows him.

       ANGLE - EVE & TROY

       They are shocked.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Heather cuts in on Miss Sweet as the other dancers stop
       to watch someone who is so much better than them. The
       three of them begin to dance together.

       ANGLE - TROY & EVE


                           TROY
                 You know, he's a very, very good--


                           EVE
                 Shut up!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR/ EVE

       Adam dances beautifully with the two women. We CUT BACK
       AND FORTH between them and Eve.

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

       Adam, Miss Sweet and Heather complete their dance with
       great aplomb.  Other dancers applaud them. Someone is
       WHISTLING LOUDLY OFF CAMERA.  Adam and his dance partners
       look over to:

       ANGLE - EVE

       She is whistling like a guy calling his dog.  Troy is
       embarrassed.

                           TROY
                 Must you...

       Eve points at Adam and beckons broadly for him to come
       over -- a basketball coach calling her player off the
       floor.

                           TROY
                 What in the hell is wrong with you?!!

       ANGLE - DANCE FLOOR

                           MISS SWEET
                 Is that your girl friend?

                           ADAM
                 No. Would you please excuse me?

                           HEATHER
                 If you'll please come back.

                           ADAM
                 I will certainly try.  And thank you
                 both very much for the dance.

       He leaves.

                           MISS SWEET
                 When was the last time you saw manners
                 like that?

                           HEATHER
                 Yeah.  It's like meeting a foreigner
                 or something.

       ANGLE - TABLE

       as Adam comes over. The music is not so loud now.

                           EVE
                     (to Troy)
                 Go to the bathroom.

                           TROY
                 Right here?
                 		(then, off her look)
                 Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't
                 sure!

       Troy rises and exits.  Adam arrives and sits down.

                           ADAM
                 You wanted to see me!

                           EVE
                 You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you
                 learn to dance like that?!  And there
                 are no starving people, are there?!

                           ADAM
                 Why are you suddenly so mad at me?

                           EVE
                 Don't change the subject! I want you
                 to tell me the truth about yourself.

                           ADAM
                 I've never lied to you.  I've maybe
                 let you believe things that you wanted
                 to believe, but I've never lied.

                           EVE
                 You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't
                 you?!

                           ADAM
                 No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love
                 with you the first time I saw you.
                     (off her look)
                 I did. I think that you are the most--

                           EVE
                 I want to know exactly who you are and
                 what you're really up to!

                           ADAM
                 All right. Let me tell you the whole
                 thing. In 1962--


                           CLIFF (OC)
                 Well, well, well.  Don't we clean up
                 nice?

       Cliff steps up to the table.  Adam, automatically a
       gentleman, rises and offers his hand.

                           ADAM
                 Hello, Cliff, how are you this
                 evening?

       Cliff barely shakes his hand.

                           CLIFF
                 Not bad.

       Then he sits in Adam's seat.

                           CLIFF
                 But I do miss that green sport coat of
                 yours.

                           ADAM
                 Thank you very much. But, Cliff,
                 that's my seat. And I was just--

                           CLIFF
                     (to Eve)
                 How 'bout a drink at the bar?

                           EVE
                     (pause, then)
                 Sure.

       They rise.  Cliff gestures to the chair.

                           CLIFF
                 It's all yours.

       Eve and Cliff go to the bar.  Adam sits down glumly.  He
       looks across the room and catches the eye of Miss Sweet
       who is seated at a table with Heather.  A GOOD LOOKING
       GUY is hitting on them.  CUTTING BACK AND FORTH between
       Adam and them we see Miss Sweet's smile escalate.  Then
       she nudges Heather who also looks over and smiles. Adam
       smiles back.  Finish with a CLOSER SHOT OF HIS POV of
       Miss Sweet's hair, butt and legs.

       ANGLE - BAR

       Eve and Cliff are in cozy conversation at the bar.
       Jonathan, Jason, and Sophie are in the bg.

       ANGLE - Troy

       returning from the restroom.  He is surprised to see Eve
       at the bar with Cliff.  When he looks back at the dance
       floor table, Adam is not there.

       ANGLE - EVE AND CLIFF

       Sipping wine.

                           EVE
                 So where is your roommate, the model?

                           CLIFF
                 You know, I don't know.  And looking
                 at you, I don't care.  It's been too
                 long, Eve.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Please excuse this interruption.

                           CLIFF
                 Oh, brother...

       WIDER - BAR

       Adam steps closer, looking past Cliff at Eve.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and
                 please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't
                 Cliff just a butt with hair?

                           CLIFF
                 What?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and
                 hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow,
                 as well?

                           CLIFF
                     (the shallowest guy in the
                      world)
                 Shallow? I'm shallow?!

                           EVE
                 Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.

                           CLIFF
                 Yeah. Before I kick your ass.

       He gives Adam a shove.

                           ADAM
                 Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to
                 defend myself.

                           CLIFF
                 Do ya?

       Cliff throws a right which Adam calmly blocks and
       counters with a short right jab to Cliff's mouth,
       snapping his head back.  It's not a big punch, but very,
       very quick. It makes Eve mad and astonishes Troy, Jason
       and Jonathan.

                           EVE
                 Stop it, you two!

                           CLIFF
                     (slightly insecure)
                 I guess we shouldn't fight in here.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 Yes, I agree.

       Cliff draws back another right.  Adam flicks out a quick
       left to Cliff's cheek, again snapping his head back, but
       not his body. (These aren't big movie hits.) Cliff takes
       a beat or two then draws back his right fist again.  Adam
       pops him in the nose. Cliff drops his right arm to his
       side.

                           EVE
                 Adam?!

                           ADAM
                 I'm sorry.

                           CLIFF
                     (increasingly insecure)
                 Maybe we shouldn't fight at all.
                 Fighting is pretty immature.

                           ADAM
                     (lowering his guard)
                 It certainly is.  I agree with you
                 completely.

                           CLIFF
                 Eve? I'm leaving.

                           EVE
                 I don't blame you!

                           ADAM
                     (turning to Eve)
                 Eve, I'm sorry.

       Seeing an opportunity, Cliff rears back with another
       right. Adam deftly pops him in the mouth again with a
       short right jab.

                           CLIFF
                     (deeply insecure)
                 Well, good night, everyone.

       Troy, Jonathan and Jason say good night to him.  Cliff
       walks unsteadily away bleeding from the mouth and both
       nostrils. (Hopeful that no one has noticed that he's very
       subtly just gotten the crap beat out of him.)

                           EVE
                 I'm leaving, too.

                           ADAM
                 But, Eve, I would--

                           EVE
                 And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
                 out--because I quit!  This is
                 ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm
                 ridiculous!

       She exits. Adam looks over at Troy who shrugs.

       EXT. EVE'S HOUSE - MIDNIGHT

       Troy takes out his keys as he approaches the front door.
       But the door opens. Eve stands there in sweats. Agitated.

                           EVE
                 He go back to the hotel?

                           TROY
                 Uh..he might of.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Troy enters. She slams the door.

                           EVE
                 What's that mean?

                           TROY
                 We did not leave together.

                           EVE
                 Who did he leave with?


                           TROY
                 What's it to you?!

                           EVE
                 I'm his pimp. He left with the
                 dancers, didn't he?

                           TROY
                 Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the
                 psychic pimp.  You tell me.

                           EVE
                 Those sluts!

                           TROY
                 Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?


       He enters the kitchen

       INT. KITCHEN

       She follows him: He gets something to drink.

       .

                           EVE
                  Where are you going?

                           TROY
                 To bed.

                           EVE
                 To bed?

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love
                 with the guy.

                           EVE
                 What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn
                 minute!

       Troy exits into his office.


       INT. OFFICE

       He plops down on the chair.

       .

                           EVE
                 In the first place, I don't fall in
                 love with weirdos I've only known for
                 four or five days.

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 And I don't fall in love with grown
                 men who collect baseball cards!!

                           TROY
                 Uh, yes, you do.

                           EVE
                 Or pee in their pants when they see
                 the ocean!

                           TROY
                 Yes, you do!

                           EVE
                 Or have perfect table manners.

                           TROY
                     (sitting up)
                 You know, I asked him about that. And
                 he said that good manners are a way we
                 have of showing other people that we
                 respect them. See, you'd eat like a
                 slob if you
                 were alone, but since another human
                 being is present, you show that person
                 respect by going to the trouble of
                 having proper manners. I didn't know
                 that. I thought it was a way of
                 appearing superior.
                     (then)
                 Know what else he told me?

                           EVE
                     (sitting on the bed)
                 What?

                           TROY
                 He thinks that I am a gentleman and
                 that you are a lady!

                           EVE
                 Well, consider the source. I don't
                 even know what a lady is.

                           TROY
                 Exactly! I thought a gentleman was
                 somebody who owned horses. Turns out,
                 the short and very simple definition
                 of a gentleman or a lady is: someone
                 who always attempts to make the people
                 around him or her feel as comfortable
                 as possible. That's it! If you don't
                 do that, nothing else matters. The
                 cars, the clothes, the houses...

                           EVE
                 Where did he get all that information?

                           TROY
                 From the oddest place. His parent's
                 told him. I don't think I got that
                 memo.

                           EVE
                 So now I suppose he's trying to make
                 those two dancers feel as comfortable
                 as possible.

                           TROY
                 He didn't leave with them.

                           EVE
                 Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear
                 that.

                           TROY
                 He left with Sophie.

                           EVE
                 What?!!

                           TROY
                 It's true.  She swept him out the door
                 whispering little French things into
                 his ear.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please
                 don't tell me that!!


                           TROY
                 What are you going to do? Go over to
                 her place and kick in the door?

                           EVE
                 You're goddamn right I am!

       She exits, then sticks her hand back in.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 You coming?!

                           TROY
                     (cringing)
                 I don't think so.

                           EVE
                 Coward!

       She exits.

                           TROY
                 Gentleman coward, to you.

       SCENE 148 OMITTED



       EXT. HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

       Eve hurries out of the house leaving the front door wide
       open.  She runs down the porch steps, across the yard,
       and to her car, which she unlocks with the usual
       fumbling.

                           EVE
                 Come on!  Come on, damn it!

       INT. CAR

       She jumps in and sticks the key in the ignition.  Adam
       appears at the passenger window.

                           ADAM
                 Hi!

       Eve SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER as she throws open her door and
       jumps out into the street where she falls down, hurting
       her knee.  Adam runs around the car to help her to her
       feet. Dogs start barking in several houses.

                           ADAM
                 Eve?!

                           EVE
                 Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You
                 stupid son of a bitch!!!

                           ADAM
                 I'm really sorry!

                           EVE
                 What in the hell are you doing here!!
                 You're supposed to be over on San
                 Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex
                 with that slut Sophie!!

                           ADAM
                 I know...and I'm really sorry.

                           EVE
                 Well, you should be!  Thanks to you,
                 my heart is in my neck!

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Goodnight!

       Eve marches, with a limp, back to the house.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, if you'll let me, I can --

                           EVE
                 Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is
                 that?!  What if this is for life?!

                           ADAM
                 I know first aid!

                           EVE
                 Well, you had better!!

       He chases her up the porch steps.

       INT. LIVING ROOM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

       Lights are low and warm.  Adam is attempting to swab the
       abrasion on Eve's knee through the tear in her old sweat
       pants.

                           EVE
                 Wait a minute.

       She reaches down and gives the knee hole a good rip,
       revealing her leg from above the knee to the gym sock.

                           EVE
                 There.

                           ADAM
                 Thanks.

       He takes the back of her calf in one hand and applies the
       antiseptic to her knee with the other.  It stings and she
       flinches.

                           ADAM
                 Steady. Steady.  It's going to be all
                 right in no time.

       He leans down and blows on the wound.  CU of that.  CU of
       his hand on her calf.  CU of her looking down at him,
       watching as he blows gently on her knee.

                           ADAM
                 I went to Sophie's and she was very
                 hospitable.

                           EVE
                 Is that what you call it?

                           ADAM
                 But it just wasn't where I wanted to
                 be so I left as politely as I could
                 and found a taxi.  But I asked the
                 driver to drop me here instead of at
                 the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como
                 sings called "On the Street Where You
                 Live."  You know it?

                           EVE
                 Sing it to me.

                           ADAM
                     (softly, saying it as much as
                      singing it)
                 "All at once am I--several stories
                 high-- knowing I'm--on the street--
                 where you live."  It's about a young
                 man who is overjoyed just to be
                 standing in front of the house of the
                 person he loves.

       She reaches down, and taking hold of his collar, draws
       him to her and they kiss very romantically and at length.
       Then:

                           EVE
                 Adam...dumb question, but humor me.
                 Have you ever had sex before?

                           ADAM
                 No.


       She sits up.

                           EVE
                 How is that possible?

       During the following speech CAMERA pushes past him and
       lingers on her as she gradually realizes that Adam is
       mental.

                           ADAM
                     (sitting up)
                 In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on
                 Los Angeles, my parents were in our
                 fallout shelter.  That's where I was
                 born. We
                 only survived because it was a huge
                 shelter as fallout shelters go. My
                 father worked on it secretly for
                 years. When he had to, he used
                 contractors, but always from out-of-
                 state and always for just a portion of
                 the job. He told them it was a secret
                 government experiment done through
                 CalTech. My Dad's not a liar, but he
                 felt in this case he had no choice. Of
                 course, it had to be a secret, because
                 we had just enough supplies to last
                 three people thirty-five years. That's
                 also why I have no brothers or
                 sisters. The air vent was the really
                 tricky part, but he was able to cut
                 into a flood control sewer. What I'd
                 like to do Eve, is take you down into
                 the fallout shelter with me. We could
                 live there with my Mom and Dad. My dad
                 said if I found a healthy girl I
                 should "bring her on down". And you
                 look plenty healthy to me.


                           EVE
                 Uh-huh. Adam?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, Eve?

                           EVE
                 I want you to go back to the hotel
                 now.  I'll call you a cab.

                           ADAM
                 Of course.  I shouldn't be over here
                 at this hour.

       He rises.  She gets up and leads him to the door.

                           EVE
                 That's right.  And I'll see you in the
                 morning in the lobby.  Do you mind
                 waiting outside for the taxi?

                           ADAM
                 Not at all.  And Eve thank you for
                 tonight...and for the kiss. My first.

                           EVE
                 My pleasure.

                           ADAM
                 It was at least as good as the sky.

                           EVE
                 Really?  Okay!

                           ADAM
                 And I think better than the ocean. I'm
                 serious!

                           EVE
                 Neat. Goodnight!

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Adam comes out glowing with happiness. He looks
       heavenward. And does his patented thumbs up.


       Behind him we hear Eve locking all the locks on her front
       door.

       EXT. VALLEY AVENUE - DAY

       A REFRIGERATED U-HAUL TRUCK lurches down the street.

       INT. TRUCK

       Adam struggles with the gears as Troy worries about his
       driving skills.

                           TROY
                 Goddamn, Adam!


                           ADAM
                 Wait a minute!

       He promptly pulls over and turns off the engine.

                           TROY
                 I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in
                 vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.

                           ADAM
                 No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back
                 there!  I'll be right back!

       Adam jumps out of the truck and runs off.

                           TROY
                 Without question, the strangest man
                 I've ever met.

       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam runs up.  The bookstore looks familiar.  Adam runs
       to the next store. It's a bar.  He runs to the next
       store.  It's the Malt Shop.  Adam is thrilled.  He tries
       the front door and at first it does not open.

       INT. MALT SHOP

       The Soda Jerk is leading about twelve followers in
       prayers.

                           SODA JERK
                 Give us a sign!  That's all we ask!
                 Give us some sort of sign!

       The front door opens and Adam peers in.  He sees the Soda
       Jerk; smiles broadly at him and waves.  Then he closes
       the
       door.  The Soda Jerk grabs his heart and faints.  His
       followers rush to his aid.

       INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam jumps in.

                           ADAM
                 Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef
                 frozen patties!

                           TROY
                 How 'bout we check with Eve first?

                           ADAM
                 You bet!

                           TROY
                 So, did you buy a movie?

                           ADAM
                 What?

                           TROY
                 A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the
                 bookstore.

                           ADAM
                     (concentrating on his
                      driving)
                 No, I wouldn't go in one of those
                 places with a gas mask on.

                           TROY
                     (laughing in agreement)
                 I know what you mean!  I usually wear
                 a big hat and dark glasses.

                           ADAM
                 Does that work?

                           TROY
                 Yeah...Seems to.

       Adam would not have thought that.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam springs in, Troy drags in behind him (knowing the
       deal). Eve is standing away from the door next to a kind
       looking professional woman named Dr.Aron.

                           ADAM
                 Hi, Eve!

                           EVE
                 Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....

                           ARON
                 I'm Nina Aron, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 How do you do?

                           ARON
                 Very well, thank you. I'm with the
                 County Family Services Department. Eve
                 tells me you've been living in a bomb
                 shelter most of your life.

                           ADAM
                 Fallout shelter. There's a difference.

                           ARON
                 Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my
                 associate -- Mr. Brown.

       BROWN appears from the kitchen.  He's good-sized man who
       dresses casually.  Adam becomes uneasy.

                           ADAM
                 Hello.

       He nods politely.

                           ARON
                 We want you to come with us so we can
                 talk some more about your experiences.

                           ADAM
                 Come where?

                           ARON
                 My office.

                           ADAM
                 For how long?

                           ARON
                 Well, that depends...

                           ADAM
                 I thank you very much for the
                 invitation, but I'm quite busy today.
                 Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.

                           EVE
                 Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron.
                 It's the best thing.  The best thing
                 for you. I promise.

                           ADAM
                 ...All right, Eve.  If you say so.

                           EVE
                 ...I do.

                           ADAM
                     (to Aron)
                 Could I please just go home?  I was
                 lost, but this morning I found home
                 and I promise not to bother any of you
                 ever again.

                           ARON
                 Let's go talk first, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Yes, ma'am.



       The two come forward.  One opens the door and one beckons
       for Adam to step out.

                           TROY
                 Good-bye, Adam.

                           ADAM
                 Goodbye.

       Adam looks back at Eve, who looks away. Adam exits.

                           ARON
                     (to Eve)
                 You'll be hearing from me.

       She shuts the door. Troy sits dejectedly.

                           EVE
                 Well what was I supposed to do?! He
                 wants me to live underground with him!
                 That's like Silence of the Lambs,
                 don't you think?!

                           TROY
                 I know...I know. You did the right
                 thing.

       Eve goes to the window and watches as WE SEE ADAM BREAK
       FROM BROWN AND RUN OFF with him chasing.

                           EVE
                 Oh, no!

                           TROY
                 What?!

       She runs out.  He follows.

       EXT. STREET

       Adam races down the sidewalk.  He cuts left and runs
       between houses.  Brown is not as fast.

       EXT. EVE'S FRONT YARD

       Eve and Troy run out to Aron who is dialing her cell
       phone.

                           EVE
                 Oh, my God!

                           ARON
                 He'll catch him.
                 		(then into phone)
                 Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run
                 away and I'm going to need police
                 assistance.

                           EVE
                 No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!

                           ARON
                 I have to. If a complaint is made and
                 the person resists obser--

                           EVE
                 No, I can't have that! They'll come
                 with their cars and their guns and
                 their handcuffs--

                           ARON
                 Calm down, please. This man needs help
                 and you need protection from him.
                 That's obvious.

                           EVE
                 You know, I don't think so. I'm
                 confused but you know, I don't think
                 he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd
                 hurt anyone.

                           ARON
                 And now you must let me be the judge
                 of that!

                           EVE
                 I was frightened and I didn't know
                 what to think! But you know-I believe
                 him. I think he just wants to go home.
                 Wherever the hell that is...

                           ARON
                 Let's all remain calm. That's the key
                 thing.





       Suddenly Adam appears from the side of the house,
       startling everyone. He tosses his hotel key to Eve.


                           ADAM
                 The key to my hotel room!  I want you
                 to have my baseball cards!
                 		(running to the truck)
                 And please be sure to pay my bill!

                           ARON
                 Young man, stop right there!

       Aron looks around for Mr. Brown.






       Adam jumps into the truck. Aron yells for him to stop.

                           ARON
                 Stop, right now! Get out of that
                 truck!

                           TROY
                 Adam, you really shouldn't try to
                 drive that truck!

                           ADAM
                     (starting the engine)
                 Bye, Troy!

                           TROY
                 Bye, Adam!

                           ADAM
                 And thanks for always being happy!

                           TROY
                 What?

                           EVE
                 Gay.

                           TROY
                 Oh.
                 		(yelling to Adam)
                 Well, you're...certainly welcome!

       Adam gets the truck in reverse and backs out of the
       driveway and into a parked car.

                           ARON
                 Hey!!! That's my car, you son of a
                 bitch!!

       Getting the truck in first, Adam has to go down the
       sidewalk a bungalow or two before he can get back onto
       the street.  He clips two parked cars as he does.  Brown
       comes running from the side of the house.  His pants are
       torn.

                           ARON (cont'd)
                 Where the hell have you been?!

                           BROWN
                 I fell down!
                     (to Troy and Eve)
                 What's the license number of that
                 truck?!

                           ARON
                 Don't ask them!  They're as fucked-up
                 as the other guy!

                           TROY
                 Let's all just try to remain calm.
                 That's the key thing.

                           ARON
                 How 'bout I just knock the shit out of
                 you?!

       Brown has to grab her.

       EXT. U-STORE-IT - LATER, SAME DAY

       Eve and Troy arrive in her GEO to see that the two locker
       doors are open and much of the stuff has been carried
       off.  Eve drops her head in disappointment.

                           TROY
                 I guess he took what he could.



                           EVE
                     (putting her head in her
                      hand)
                 Good God...you don't think there
                 really is a bomb shelter, do you?

                           TROY
                 Fallout shelter.

       She gives him a look.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                 There's a difference.

       INT. SHELTER, PATIO - LATER, SAME DAY

       Helen is using the hip-reduction machine while Calvin
       reads, How to Win Friends and Influence People. The
       distant sound of the hatchway being open gets their
       attention.  Then:

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?!  Dad?!  I'm home!

       They jump up and race into the living room, meeting Adam
       halfway.   The parents kiss and hug their son before
       noticing that he's got the Soda Jerk with him.

                           ADAM
                 I've got almost everything we need!
                 And this nice man...

                           SODA JERK
                 Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.

       He promptly drops to his knees in supplication.

                           ADAM
                 ...and his church group have
                 volunteered to help us bring the
                 supplies down.  But we've got to
                 hurry.

                           HELEN
                 Are you in trouble, son?!

                           ADAM
                 I think I'm being chased by a
                 psychiatrist.

                           HELEN
                 A psychiatrist?!

                           SODA JERK
                 It happens.

                           HELEN
                 My goodness! How bad is it up there?!

                           SODA JERK
                 Horrible.

                           CALVIN
                 You have something on your forehead.

                           SODA JERK
                 I know.

       INT. ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM - DUSK

       Eve and Troy look around.  She opens a drawer and sees
       how nicely folded and put away things are.  Troy notices
       "TV Guide" and the Gideon Bible sitting out with a page
       marker in it.  He opens the night table drawer and takes
       out the cigar box.

                           TROY
                 This it?

       Eve nods.

                           TROY
                 What do you want to do with it?

                           EVE
                 Give it back to him.

                           TROY
                 And if we can't find him?

                           EVE
                 We'll find him.

       INT. BATHROOM, ADAM'S HOTEL ROOM

       Eve enters and looks at how tidy Adam's toiletries are;
       how the comb is just right in the brush; how the tooth
       paste (Ipanna in a '61 tube) has been squeezed from the
       bottom; and at how he has hung up his socks to dry.  It
       makes her very sad.  She picks up the toothpaste and
       holds it as if it were his ring.

                           TROY (OC)
                 Hey, Eve?  Eve?

       He enters with stock certificates and sees that she's
       very close to crying.

                           TROY
                 What's wrong?

                           EVE
                 I don't know.  Everything's so neat.
                 It's all just so...goddamn dear.
                 		(starting to cry)
                 Damn!

                           TROY
                 See these?  Found them in the box with
                 the cards.  These are stock
                 certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.

       Instead of taking the certificates, she hands him the
       toothpaste and sits down on the bed in a funk.

                           TROY (cont'd)
                     (looking at the toothpaste)
                 Ipana. I think I remember that brand.
                     (then)
                 Oh, here, you should read this.
                 "Trademark, 1961."

       He holds out the tube and she takes it to read.


       EXT. REAR OF MALT SHOP - SAME TIME

       Adam, the Soda Jerk and fifteen followers hurriedly
       unload the truck, taking provisions into the back door of
       the malt shop.

       INT. JASON'S OFFICE - SAME TIME

       Their pal Jason is on the phone with Troy.

                           JASON
                 Purchased in 1958 and '59?  Ten
                 thousand shares of each?  They'd be
                 worth millions. Hell, I don't
                 know...millions upon millions upon
                 millions!  How 'bout that?

       INT. HOTEL ROOM - EARLY EVENING

       Troy is on the phone.  Eve is standing, looking at the
       stock certificates.

                           TROY
                 Thanks, Jason.

       He slams down the phone and jumps to his feet.

                           TROY
                 Millions upon millions upon millions!
                 The cards. The stock!  The clothes!
                 The toothpaste!  The guy was on the
                 level!  And you blew it!  A man walks
                 into your life who is the kindest,
                 most polite, honest, trustworthy,
                 incredibly rich guy you have ever met
                 in your life!! And what do you do?!

                           EVE
                 Have him committed.

                           TROY
                 Yeah! That's thinking.

                           EVE
                 He was always so "nice"! How was I
                 supposed to know that's a good thing?!
                 "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is
                 "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you
                 that.
                     (beat, then)
                 Was it ever?

                           TROY
                 I don't know. I like to think so.

                           EVE
                 Well, at least I fell for him before I
                 found out he was rich! That's new.
                     (then)
                 Wait a minute! He said today he knew
                 where home was. What happened this
                 morning?! Where did you go?!

                           TROY
                 To get some frozen poultry.

                           EVE
                 Then what?

                           TROY
                 We came back to the house!

                           EVE
                 You didn't stop anywhere else?!

                           TROY
                 No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a
                 porno store.

                           EVE
                 What?!

                           TROY
                 An adult bookstore. He was very
                 excited about seeing it. You think
                 home is under a dirty bookstore in the
                 Valley?

                           EVE
                 Come on.

       She heads out.

                           TROY
                 Trendy address.

       They exit.


       EXT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       Troy and Eve approach and enter.



       INT. ADULT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

       The Pakistani looks up briefly when Eve and Troy enter.
       There are two male customers in the bg. Eve taps her foot
       on the floor hoping to hear a hollow sound.  But it is
       solid.  She and Troy move about the store tapping their
       feet and finally jumping up and down.  The Pakistani and
       two customers become concerned.

                           EVE
                     (to Pakistani)
                 Have you got a basement?

                           PAKISTANI
                     (indicating merchandise)
                 Believe me, all the really good stuff
                 is right here.

                           EVE
                 Is there a back entrance?

                           PAKISTANI
                 Are you kidding?  Of course.

       He points to the rear of the store.

       EXT. REAR MALT SHOP PARKING LOT - NIGHT

       The Soda Jerk drives the rental truck away leaving the
       lot empty and the door to the Malt Shop closed. Troy and
       Eve appear after the truck is gone.

                           EVE
                 Why would you put a fallout shelter
                 under a porno shop?

                           TROY
                 None of this stuff was here in 1962.
                 The Valley was mostly small homes and
                 fruit orchards.

                           EVE
                 Well, we've come a long way, haven't
                 we?  I want to go home.

                           TROY
                 Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.

       They turn left to get back to the avenue.

       INT. EVE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

       The phone is ringing.  Then the recorder answers.

                           TROY
                 Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a
                 message. And if you want to leave a
                 number don't say it fast! I hate that!
                 Say it slow. Thank you.

       Beep,

                           ADAM
                 Uh, Eve...this is Adam.  Look, I just
                 wanted to thank you for everything you
                 did for me...and I wanted to tell you
                 that I...uh...that I wish so many good
                 things for you. I wish so hard that
                 all of your dreams come true. Um...I,
                 uh...



       EXT. AVENUE - NIGHT

       Eve lets Troy drive.  She clutches the cigar box and
       rests her head on the seat as they pull away from the
       curb in front of the bookstore.  A low rider passes them
       on the left.  Eve sees an old hag being shoved out of the
       bar and a homeless man slipping into the abandoned malt
       shop and the cross-dressing STREET WALKER making eyes at
       passing cars and Adam hanging up the pay phone he just
       used.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

                           TROY
                 Where?!

                           EVE
                 Stop!

       She rolls down her window.

                           EVE
                 Adam!!

       ANGLE - ADAM

       Turning when he hears Eve yell his name.

       ANGLE - EVE

       Running from the car.  The cigar box falls to the street
       and the contents scatter.  Eve could care less.  Besides,
       Troy is there to retrieve everything.

       In a series of cuts and slo-mo action the couple race
       into each other's arms...to the pleasure of all the
       lowlifes mentioned above.  Now the street looks more like
       Capra than Scorsese. She's surprised that she wants to
       kiss him so bad. He's surprised that he gets so
       aggressive.

       INT. SHELTER, KITCHEN - LATER, SAME NIGHT

       Helen watches Calvin work on the timing device for the
       locks with a screwdriver.

                           HELEN
                 How long will you set it for this
                 time?

                           CALVIN
                 I thought ten years.

                           HELEN
                 Well, that's...considerably shorter
                 than before.  I was wondering, Calvin,
                 why set the locks at all.  I mean the
                 radiation is gone and...

                           CALVIN
                 To keep what's up there from getting
                 down here! It's not the radiation I'm
                 worried about.

                           ADAM (OC)
                 Mom?  Dad?

       They turn to see Adam walking forward with Eve.

                           ADAM
                 I'd like for you to meet Miss Eve
                 Rustokov.

       Calvin knows a Russian name when he hears one. But he
       chooses not to pursue it.

                           EVE
                     (stepping forward, offering
                      her hand)
                 How do you do, Mrs. Webber?  Mr.
                 Webber?

                           WEBBERS
                     (rather dumb-struck)
                 Hello.

                            EVE
                 Uh-huh. I've heard so many wonderful
                 things about you.

                           HELEN
                 Well, please excuse us!  We...we
                 haven't entertained a guest in...um...

                           CALVIN
                 Some time.

                           HELEN
                 What can I offer you, Eve?

                           ADAM
                 Mom?  Eve and I have to go.

                           HELEN
                 What?

                           ADAM
                 I can't explain it now.  But I want
                 you to set the locks for two months.
                 You have more than enough of
                 everything.  Then we'll be back to get
                 you.

                           CALVIN
                 But, I don't understand.

                           ADAM
                 And, I'm asking you to trust me
                 without understanding why.

                           CALVIN
                 Well, in that case...of course, son.

                           HELEN
                 Of course.

                           EVE
                 They are wonderful parents.

                           ADAM
                 We have to go.

                           HELEN
                 No, wait! At least stay for dinner!

                           CALVIN
                 Yes, please! You must.

                           ADAM/EVE
                 Well...sure...okay.

       INT. BAR - AN HOUR LATER

       Calvin mixes drinks just like he did at the party in
       1962. Adam is with him.

       INT. - KITCHEN

       Helen races around, just like she did in 1962, getting
       the roast ready. Eve. watches.

                           EVE
                 Adam said I shouldn't mention the
                 Communists.

                           HELEN
                 Oh, yes! Please, don't mention the
                 Communists!

       INT. - DINING ROOM

       Helen hurries out of the kitchen to take her seat. The
       others are already there.

                           HELEN
                 Eve. I hope I'm not being nosey, but
                 are you and Adam...um...dating?

                           EVE
                 Yes, Mrs. Webber we are.
                     (then)
                 I'm also from Pasadena.

       Helen nearly comes unglued. Calvin is pleased, too. He
       raises his tea cup.

                           CALVIN
                 A toast! To Adam and Eve!

       The others also raise their cups and everyone clicks.
       Then they drink.

                           EVE
                     (gagging)
                 What is this sh...stuff?!

                           CALVIN
                 Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don't know
                 how good it is heated up.

                           EVE
                 You know, they don't, do they?

       They begin to eat.

                           EVE (cont'd)
                 What about grace?

                           HELEN
                 Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot!
                     (then)
                 I like your friend, Adam.

       They all join hands and lower their heads. Calvin leads
       them.

                           EVE (VO)
                 And you thought your parents were
                 weird.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF LA - MORNING

       Adam and Eve are with a REAL ESTATE BROKER. The broker
       unlocks the gate of a chain-link fence and Adam and Eve
       step onto the property. The broker's Lexus is in the b.g.

                           BROKER
                 It's like the Garden of Eden, don't
                 you think?

       Adam and Eve respond but we can't hear them under Eve's
       narration.

                           EVE (VO)
                 You see, that night, Adam had a choice
                 between me and his parents.







       SCENE 173 OMITTED

       EXT. VALLEY PROPERTY - DAY

       Adam and Eve are working with a TEAM OF ARCHITECTS AND
       CONTRACTORS at the site of a new home. They have plans
       and are discussing dimensions.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It's truly amazing what you can get
                 done when you have unlimited funds.
                 Did you know you can have whole houses
                 built in just a matter of months. All
                 you have to say is this..."I don't
                 care what it costs."  And then, of
                 course, you've got
                 to really mean it, which no one ever
                 does.

       EXT. NEW HOUSE - DAY

       It is under construction.


       EXT. MELROSE RETRO FURNITURE STORE - DAY

       Adam, Eve and Troy enter.

       INT. RETRO STORE

       This is great stuff from the fifties and the sixties.
       Adam finds things very similar to what he grew up with.
       There's a
       lamp (or something) that's just like the lamp (or
       something) from the Webber living room.

                           ADAM
                 That lamp is perfect!

                           STORE OWNER
                     (very faggy)
                 I'm holding that for Elton John.

                           TROY
                     (faggy right back)
                 Oh, I think not.

       SCENE 176 OMITTED  (REFER TO SCENE 172D)



       EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF MALT SHOP (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT

       Adam and Eve embracing as Troy picks up baseball cards
       and the street people look on.

                           ADAM
                 Eve, I've got to go back! My parents
                 can't handle this up here. And there
                 was no bomb, was there?



                           EVE
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 See! I can't tell them that!  I can't
                 ever let them know. It makes their
                 life..well, frankly...
                 a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You
                 understand?

                           EVE
                 We can make this work, Adam! Believe
                 me! I'm very good at making things
                 work!

                           ADAM
                 My mother's like that.

       They kiss again.



       INT. MALT SHOP - DAY

       Eve and Troy are showing large color drawings to the Soda
       Jerk.  In CU we see the Malt Shop exterior all dolled up
       with a big lighted sign that says "GIVE ME SHELTER."
       There's valet parking and the Adult Bookstore and Bar
       have been turned into a Souvenir Center (think Planet
       Hollywood).  Another drawing shows fashionable guests
       boarding the elevator.

                           EVE (VO)
                 It took a while to convince Archbishop
                 Milker that Adam wasn't God, and he
                 was pretty broken up about it, too,
                 until I showed him my plans for Los
                 Angeles' hottest and most original
                 night spot.

       Other drawings show dancing on the shelter patio and
       guided tours being shown various parts of the shelter.

                           EVE
                 You'll be a ten percent partner and
                 still retain ownership of the
                 entrance.

                           SODA JERK
                 Praise the Lord.  And I mean the real
                 one.

       EXT. BEAUTIFUL VALLEY NORTH OF L.A. - TWO MONTHS LATER

       A 1962 Cadillac leads a 1962 windowless van through
       automatic gates that have signs on them saying:  PRIVATE
       ROAD and NO TRESPASSING. Troy drives the van. Eve drives
       the Cadillac. Adam is her passenger.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Our idea was to bring Adam's parents
                 up to the surface very slowly.  Make
                 them very comfortable and then break
                 the bad news to them that there was no
                 nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn't
                 kill them Adam's going to tell his
                 father about the Internet.

       EXT. EXACT REPLICA OF THE WEBBER HOUSE - DAY

       The cars pull up and Adam lets his parents out. They go
       bonkers when they see the house.





       INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       The parents enter first. They are thrilled, shocked, etc.

       INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

       As a demonstration, Troy removes a hot cup of coffee from
       the microwave.  Helen is happy to see this handy new
       device.  Calvin, the inventor, sticks his head into the
       machine to investigate its workings.

       INT. FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

       Adam demonstrates the VCR to his parents as Troy and Eve
       look on.

                           ADAM
                 You put the tape in here and you get a
                 movie -- in your own home.

       We see the main title to Natural Born Killers come up on
       the screen. Troy and Eve rush forward.

                           EVE/TROY
                 No!!

       INT. ADAM'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

       It has been turned into an office for Calvin.

                           HELEN
                 This is your bedroom?

                           ADAM
                 No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's
                 office.

                           HELEN
                 Well, where are you --

                           ADAM
                 Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.

                           HELEN
                 No.

                           ADAM
                 Yes.

                           EVE
                 Is that all right?

                           HELEN
                 It's wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!

       They hug.

                           HELEN (cont'd)
                 Calvin!  They're married!

                           CALVIN
                     (offering his hand to both)
                 That's wonderful. We Webber guys have
                 mighty good luck when it comes to
                 women.

       Calvin points out the computer.

                           CALVIN (cont'd)
                 What's that thing?

                           ADAM
                 It's kind of a combination television-
                 typewriter-telephone-post office type
                 of thing.
                     (leading Calvin out)
                 I'll show it to you later.

       EXT. PATIO - AN HOUR LATER

       Adam and Calvin exit the house. They wear baseball gloves
       and start playing catch. (Calvin notes the modern
       construction of his glove, but does not comment on it.)

                           CALVIN
                 This is great son, just great. By the
                 way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov,
                 that's not Russian, is it?

                           ADAM
                 It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents
                 immigrated here.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

                           ADAM
                 Dad, I don't know how to tell you
                 this. And I was going to wait a while,
                 but I think...Dad,there was no bomb.
                 A plane crashed into our backyard. I
                 looked it up in old newspapers.

                           CALVIN
                     (after a while)
                 You're sure?

                           ADAM
                 Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed
                 without a shot being fired. The Cold
                 War is over.

                           CALVIN
                 That's what everybody believes?

                           ADAM
                 Yes, sir. It's true.

                           CALVIN
                 What? Did the politburo just one day
                 say - "We give up?"

                           ADAM
                 Yes. That's kind of how it was.

                           CALVIN
                 Uh-huh.

       Adam throws the ball, but Calvin makes no attempt to
       catch it.

                           CALVIN
                 My gosh, those Commies are brilliant!
                 You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we
                 didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our
                 evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor
                 us!"  I bet they've even asked the
                 West for aid!  Right?!

                           ADAM
                 Uh, I think they have.

                           CALVIN
                 Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
                 dissemblers! Those, uh...
                     (he can't think of another
                      description, so he moves on)
                 They've finally pulled the wool over
                 everybody's eyes!

                           EVE (VO)
                 Have you ever in your life seen a son
                 who did more for his parents?

       Helen comes out with a tray of champagne cocktails.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Adam says that this is simply how
                 things work.  First the parents take
                 care of the children and then the
                 children take care
                 of the parents. He says historically,
                 that's how it works.

       INT. LIVING ROOM

       Eve and Troy are sitting by the window.  Adam and Helen
       come in to offer cocktails to Troy and Eve.

                           EVE (VO)
                 Whenever Adam gives me such obviously
                 incorrect information, I just smile,
                 slap him on the knee, and look out the
                 window.
                 Why spoil his dreams?  They're such
                 wonderful dreams.

       The CAMERA wanders off of them and shoots out the glass
       doors. We see Calvin behind the house...measuring off the
       dimensions for a fallout shelter.

       EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

       Calvin continues to measure as we pull way back and up.
       Perry Como sings "We'll Meet Again".

       MOVING IN FAST MOTION -- a kaleidoscopic jewel box --
       glittering, shining and speeding PAST our eyes.

       MOVING south TO north FROM the Battery and the World
       Trade Center, streets and buildings FLIPPING PAST like
       black diamonds spilling INTO our peripheral vision and
       DISAPPEARING as we SPEED uptown TOWARD...

       Cars and people caught in the same frantic ballet of
       shining lights as we RACE UP the avenue, and the voice
       of Peter Fallow speaks to us...
                                 PETER (V.O.)
                   Yes. We're getting closer. Can
                   you feel it. Can you see it?
                   The heat. The brilliance. Moving
                   fast into the heart of it. Buzz.
                   Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The
                   city is pulling you in. The city
                   of light. The city of diabolical
                   promise. The city of answered
                   prayers.

       the lower garage.
A11B   INT. LOADING AREA - LIMOUSINE - NIGHT                      A11B

       pulls up. A male and female aide -- both carrying
       walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER
       FALLOW from the back seat. He is wearing a tuxedo and
       dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful
       beyond his means. CONTINUE IN ONE SHOT as...
       TWO AIDES

       try to lead Fallow into the building. Fallow is clutch-
       ing a whiskey decanter and a seltzer bottle. He leans
       heavily on the aides, stumbles and can barely stay on his
       feet.

       MINI CART

       approaches. The aides flag it down and throw Fallow onto
       the cart. The cart carries him past the garbage con-
       tainer into a long tunnel-like corridor.

       FALLOW

       sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself --
       he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out
       of another pocket. But he is physically incompetent.

       FEMALE AIDE
       jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up.   The male
       aide runs alongside the cart.

       VARIOUS WAITERS
       in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot
       through the tunnel.
       VARIOUS BUSBOYS

       come running in the other way, pushing carts filled with
       dirty dishes and glasses.
       CART

       comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt.
       Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with
       soda water.
       MALE AIDE
       pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him
       through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards
       run to meet them. The guards and the aide now escort
       Fallow through the area.
       A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS

       pop out of nowhere, trying to get a picture. The guards
       push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor.

       FOREIGN DIPLOMAT

       and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head
       for an elevator. The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a
       book to autograph.

       Fallow misses the pen and falls face down into the
       breasts of the diplomat's daughter. The guards pull him
       into the elevator.

       CART OF FOOD

       is in the elevator -- a tray of salmon mousse in the
       shape of a three-foot salmon. The elevator starts to
       move.  Fallow falls into the mousse. The aide pulls him
       up and tries to clean him off.

       ELEVATOR DOORS
       open. Fallow is led out of the elevator. Several other
       aides approach him and pull off his soiled jacket and
       shirt and change them for fresh ones as they move.
       SOME BROADWAY AUTOGRAPH HOUNDS

       rush Fallow, snapping pictures with little Instamatics
       and trying to get an autograph.
       FALLOW
       is led through the corridor and into...
       WINTERGARDEN

       A ten story glass atrium. A black tie party. A sixty-
       foot banner with Fallow's name on it. Wild applause.
       But before Fallow can get his bearings...
       WALL OF FLASHING CAMERAS
       obliterate the view.    Fallow staggers, clutching his head
       and we...

11A    EXT. PARK AVE. APARTMENT - SKYLIGHT - EVENING               11A

       THROUGH the skylight we can see Sherman McCoy on his
       hands and knees on the green marble foyer of this lavish
       apartment chasing the family dachshund, trying to attach
       a leash.

                                  PETER (V.O.)
                    ... And it begins on a rainy
                    night, only a few months ago.

                                  SHERMAN
                    Come on, Marshall. Come here.

       The dog escapes. Sherman smacks his perfect WASP knee
       on the perfect marble floor.

                   Our hero, Sherman McCoy, was about
                   to make a simple phone call. And
                   despite the existence of eleven
                   telephones and seven different
                   lines in the fourteen rooms of his
                   six million dollar plus apartment,
                   this was a phone call he could not
                   make at home.

                   You are not taking the dog for a
                   walk. You are taking 'Marshall'
                   for a walk. Marshall has a name.
                   He is one of our family. And,
                   anyway, it's raining.
                                  SHERMAN
                   I know that.
      The DOG GROWLS and snaps at Sherman.

                   So does Marshall. I don't think

      Sherman gets the leash fastened. He stands up, pulls
      on a rubberized British riding mac. Judy flicks a tiny
      plastic bag out of a cleverly-concealed container and
      hands it to Sherman.

      up and the immaculately-dressed POLLARD BROWNING gets

                                SHERMAN
                   Yes. As a matter of fact, I did
                   notice.
                                 POLLARD
                   Ah, Sherman. A true friend to
                   man's best friend.
                                 SHERMAN
                   Pollard, you old phrase-maker.

                                 POLLARD
                   I beg your pardon.

                                 SHERMAN
                   I mean, is that the best you can
                   do? Is that as witty as we get?

      As Pollard enters the building and Sherman drags Marshall
      away...

                   I don't know what you're talking
                   about. And furthermore, if you
                   plan on being wet when you return,
                   I suggest you take the service

                 everybody's stripping the twenty
                 years?!

       finishes one man's shoes, collects three dollars and
       moves on to the next. (Except for giving him the money,
       nobody registers his presence.)

                               FOURTH MAN
                 Bid eight and a half. And then I
                 want you to work hard on this,
                 see what's happening with the
                 escrow, do they forfeit or no?

                 This Goldman order    really fucked

     Sherman and several men are seated at attention facing an
     Adam bowfront cabinet. The cabinet is richly painted
     with scenes of bucolic splendor and ornate borders. On
     top of this museum piece, a black plastic SPEAKER over
     which the voice of Gene Lopwitz is addressing his
     inferiors.

                  I'm confident on this, Gene.   It's
                  a real sleeping beauty.
     A THROTTLED ROAR comes out of the SPEAKER.

     CLANGING noise of CARS POUNDING along the expressway.
     But he can't see them. He can only hear them and feel
     their vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the
     strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the
     tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A little chill of lone-
     liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the tire
     -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could
     never have imagined.

     Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind
     the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his
     jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman.
     Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket.
     He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes
     up finally.

     back at him. Sherman throws up his arms. The tire

               I wonder if we should report this
               to the police.

                             MARIA
               The police?

                             SHERMAN
               I mean we were almost robbed and I
               think maybe it's possible you... we
               hit one of them. There was this kind
               of... There was this sound. Did you
               hear it? Like we hit one of them.
                             MARIA
               Did you see him get hit?
                             SHERMAN
               No.

                             MARIA
               Neither did I. So if the question
               ever comes up, all that happened
               was, two boys blocked the road
               and tried to rob us and we got
               away. That's all we know.

               Yes, let's call them and invite
               them over here to our little love

                   District Attorney -- who dreams
                   every night that someday he is
                   going to be mayor of New York City
                   -- what he needs is a white man.
                   He needs to find him, book him,
                   and throw him in jail. Then he
                   looks good to everybody. The
                   press likes it, the voters like
                   it, even your mother will like it.
                   You follow me now, Mr. Kramer?
                                 KRAMER
                   Yes, Your Honor.

                                 JUDGE WHITE
                   So you go tell your boss, the
                   district attorney, Captain Ahab
                   Weiss that I know he's out there
                   looking for the great white
                   defendent... but Mr. Williams over
                   there is not it.

                                KRAMER
                  Steam control?
                                BACON
                  That's right. Steam control.
                  Because a righteous steam is building
                  up in the souls of my people and
                  that steam is ready to blow.

                                 KRAMER

                  blows -- and it will, my friend --
                  how grateful you will be that I
                  am on your side -- the one nigger
                  who can control the steam and save

      No response.

                   Have you ever thought, I mean,
                   what if we moved out of New York?

                   She knew how to hurt a guy. No.
                   He was nothing like his father.
                   His father, the lion of Dunning,
                   Sponget and Leach. His father, who
                   took the subway to work every day
                   of his life. His father, who still
                   believed in principals and ethics,
                   whose repeated lessons concerning
                   duty, debt and responsibility had
                   whistled through his son's head.
                   No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like
                   his father.
102   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - PORCH - DAY                                102

      Sherman and Judy are having drinks with Sherman's FATHER
      and MOTHER. Over the following, Campbell is tugging at
      Judy's sleeve, asking repeatedly, "But what does he do?
      What does Daddy do?!" To which, Judy replies, "He sells
      bonds." Sherman is, at the same time, searching through
      a newspaper for any news of the accident.
                                 MRS. McCOY (MOTHER)
                   ... And she said to me, 'I like my
                   older customers best of all.
                   They're the only ones who drink
                   anymore.'

      Everyone laughs.
                                 MRS. McCOY
                   'My older customers!'

                                 MR. McCOY (FATHER)
                   She thought you were twenty-five.

                   All of a sudden I'm married to a

                   Sherman, what are you looking for
                   in that newspaper?
                                  SHERMAN
                   Nothing.   I... uh... no, nothing
                   special.

                                 CAMPBELL
                   But what's a bond?

                                 MRS. McCOY
                          (delighted)
                   Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it.

                                 MR. McCOY
                   Yes. Your mother and I really
                   want to hear this, Sherman.
                                 SHERMAN
                   A bond is a way of lending   people
                   money.  Let's say you want   to
                   build a road or a hospital   and you
                   need a lot of money. Well,    you
                   issue a bond...
                                 CAMPBELL
                   Do you build roads?

                                 SHERMAN
                   No, I don't actually build them...
                                 MR. McCOY
                   I think you're in over your head.
      More laughter.

                                 JUDY
                   Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy
                   doesn't build roads or hospitals
                   or anything, really. Daddy just
                   handles the bonds for the people
                   who raise the money.
                                 CAMPBELL
                   That's what he said. Bonds.

                                 JUDY
                   Yes. See, just imagine that a
                   bond is a slice of cake. Now you
                   didn't bake that cake, but every
                   time you hand somebody a slice of
                   that cake, a little bit comes off,
                   little crumbs fall off. And you're
                   allowed to keep those crumbs.

                          (pointedly)
                   And many a man has sold his soul
                   for those little crumbs.

                          (enjoying this)
                   Yes. And that's what Daddy does.
                   He passes somebody else's cake
                   around and picks up the crumbs.
                   But you have to imagine a lot of
                   crumbs. And a great golden cake.
                   And a lot of golden crumbs. And
                   you have to imagine Daddy running
                   around picking up every little
                   golden crumb he can get his hands
                   on. That's what Daddy does.
                                 SHERMAN
                   Well, you can call them crumbs
                   if you want to...
                                 JUDY
                   That's the best I can do.   Excuse
                   me.

      She gets up abruptly and leaves. Mrs. McCoy goes after
      Judy. Sherman and his father sit there without talking.
      Then...
                                 MR. McCOY
                   Of course, in my day, there was
                   some integrity to it...

                                    SHERMAN

                   Now it's not about anything, is
                   it? Except the money.
                                 SHERMAN
                   I don't make the rules.

                                 MR. McCOY
                   All the more reason not to play
                   the game.

                                 SHERMAN
                   We're having a little... It's

104    INT. LEICESTER'S RESTAURANT - CLOSE ON PETER FALLOW -       104
       NIGHT

       Peter's face is flat on the bar. He looks bad -- drunk,
       out of shape, disheveled and probably unclean.
                               PETER (V.O.)
                 Of course, up to this point in our
                 story, I was blissfully ignorant.
                 I had no idea of the storm that
                 was gathering. Never even heard
                 of Sherman McCoy. Hadn't the
                 faintest notion that soon his name
                 would be inexorably tied to mine.
                 That his fate would be inextricably
                 bound to my own destiny.

       nudges Peter awake and puts three drinks into Peter's
       hands. Peter staggers away from the bar, carrying the
       drinks.
                               PETER (V.O.)
                 I had my own problems. And I
                 simply had no idea that Sherman
                 McCoy was the solution I was
                 looking for.

       enter the restaurant. He is handsome and young. She is
       older and not as pretty as he is. Peter intercepts them.
                               PETER
                 Caroline. You devil.    Come and
                 have a drink with us.

       Peter steers them to a table filled with people.

                              PETER
                 Yes. And a very pretty someone he
                 is, too.

                   Why don't you squeeze in next to
                   Billy Cortez. Billy, you keep your
                   hands to yourself. Now, Filippo,
                   you sit down on top of Billy and
                   I'll see if I can get Caroline to
                   sit down on my face.

      Peter sits in a chair and tries to pull Caroline into his
      lap. Caroline grabs Filippo.

                                 CAROLINE
                   No thanks, Peter. The last time I
                   sat on your face, I ended up with
                   a yeast infection.

      They leave.    Peter laughs and almost falls off his chair.

                   child came in pulling a toy wagon
                   around the table and on the wagon
                   was a fresh turd. Her own, I
                   suppose. And the parents just
                   shook their heads and smiled.

                   shake my head and smile. But in
                   my house, when a turd appears, we
                   deal with it. We dispose of it.
                   We flush it away. We don't put it

                I could always go back home.
                Small town, small newspaper. Or
                I could take the time off, write
                a novel or two. Or I could slit
                my wrists. This last suggestion
                actually seemed the most appealing

               Henry Lamb?   Who's that?

118   ANGLE TO INCLUDE PETER FALLOW AND RIFKIN                   118

                             PETER
               He was a student of yours at
               Ruppert High. In your English
               class.
                              RIFKIN
               He was?   What's he done?

                             PETER
               He was seriously injured. I'm
               a journalist. I write for a
               newspaper.
                              RIFKIN
               Oh.   I don't remember him.

                             PETER
               What I would like to find out is
               what kind of student he was.
                             RIFKIN
               Well, if I don't remember him,
               I guess he was okay.
                             PETER
               Would you say he was a 'good'
               student?
                             RIFKIN
               'Good' doesn't really apply to
               Ruppert High. They're either
               cooperative or life-threatening.
               There's no in-between.

                             PETER
               His mother says he was considering
               going to college.

                             RIFKIN
               Well, she means City College.
               They have an open admissions
               policy. So, if you live in the
               city and you graduate from high
               school and you're still breathing,
               they have to take you.

                                 PETER
                   Well, is there anything at all you
                   can tell me about his performance
                   or aptitude -- anything at all?
                                  RIFKIN
                   Look, Mr...?

                                  PETER
                   Fallow.

                                 RIFKIN
                   I got sixty-five students in
                   every class...

                                 PETER
                   Do you have any of his written
                   work?
                                 RIFKIN
                   Oh, Jesus, there hasn't been any
                   written work at Ruppert High
                   since... oh, fifteen years.
                   Maybe twenty.
                                 PETER
                   Well, there must be some record
                   of how he measures up to the
                   others...
                                 RIFKIN
                   No. See, you're thinking about
                   grades and honor students and high
                   achievers. We don't make those
                   kinds of comparisons. We're just
                   trying to keep them off the
                   street. At Ruppert High, an honor
                   student is somebody who comes to
                   class and doesn't piss on the
                   teacher.

                                 PETER
                          (pauses; then)
                   Well, by that standard, is Henry
                   Lamb an honors student?

                                 RIFKIN
                   Well, he never pissed on me. So
                   by that standard, yes. I guess he
                   must be.

                   Oh, Sherman. You are    completely
                   paranoidical. Look, I    have to
                   leave for the airport   in twenty
                   minutes. So we don't    have much

                   How? They don't have the full
                   number, they don't have a witness,

                                SHERMAN
                   Right. There is the other boy,
                   however. Suppose he came forward.

                                 MARIA
                   If he was gonna materialize, he
                   would have done it by now. And
                   the reason he hasn't, is because
                   he's a criminal. Would you get my
                   blue jacket out of that closet?
      Sherman gets the jacket.     Maria starts putting a painting        *

                                 MARIA
                   No. No. How could it be? Come
                   on, give me a hand. I'm taking it

                   The airport. I told you. I have
                   a car coming in -- oh, God, ten
                   minutes. We have time for a
                   quickie. What do you say?

                                 SHERMAN
                   I'm upset, Maria. I just lost 600
                   million dollars. And possibly my
                   job. I don't feel terrifically

                    this, Mr. Fallow. This is show
                    business. And I've never known
                    the two to go hand in hand.

                    Oh, I don't think so. I don't
                    think so at all. Get with the
                    program, Mr. Fallow, you may have

                    back in Kansas. But this is New

                 Brothers and sisters. I stand
                 before you with a heart that is
                 broken. And I stand before you
                 with a heart that is angry. Heart
                 broken because our brother, our

                 heart. But my heart is also
                 angry. Angry because the driver
                 of that car did nothing for him!
                 And neither did the police. And
                 neither did this man -- Mr.

                    We just need to ask a few
                    questions...

                                    SHERMAN
                    Sure.   Yes.   Go ahead.
                                  MARTIN
                    So. Let's see. Can you tell us
                    if your car was in use the night
                    this happened?

                                  SHERMAN

                    Tuesday a week ago.

                                  SHERMAN
                    I don't know. Let me think.         I'd
                    have to figure...

                    Anybody else use your car?

                                  SHERMAN
                    My wife. Sometimes. And the
                    people at the garage.

                                  MARTIN

                    Yes.

                    You leave the car with the keys
                    and they park it.

                                   SHERMAN
                    Well... yes.
                                  MARTIN
                    Could we go there and take a look

                    Soon as we leave here. We could
                    take a look. There's things
                    that's consistent with an incident
                    like this. We don't find those
                    things, we move on down the list.

                    Yeah.

                                  SHERMAN
                    I see.

                                  MARTIN
                    We don't have a description of a
                    driver. So we gotta look for the
                    car. And that means bothering a
                    lot of innocent people. We're
                    sorry about the inconvenience.
                    But it's a routine sort of thing.
                                  SHERMAN
                    I understand. But if it is a
                    routine, well, I should, I guess
                    I ought to... well, follow the
                    routine that's appropriate to me,
                    to someone with a car in this
                    situation. You see?
       Martin and Goldberg look at each other.     Then they follow

                    No.   I don't follow.
                                  SHERMAN
                    Well, I mean, if you have a
                    routine in an investigation like
                    this -- I don't know how these
                    things work, but there must also
                    be a routine for a person like me,
                    an owner of a car with a license
                    number -- I think that's what I
                    need to consider. The routine.
                                  MARTIN
                    We just want to look at the car.
                                  SHERMAN
                    That's what I mean. You see?

                    Well, I... how do you mean?

                                  GOLDBERG
                    Because, if there is, now is the
                    time to tell us. Before things
                    get complicated.

                                  SHERMAN
                    No. I just think... I think that,
                    just to be sure, certain, safe...
                    I think...
                                  GOLDBERG
                    Let me put it this way, if you
                    want to cooperate, that's great.
                    If you have reasons for not
                    cooperating, then I should tell
                    you that you don't have to say
                    anything. That's your right. If
                    you want, you can say nothing at
                    all. You also have the right to
                    an attorney. I mean, for that
                    matter, if you lacked the 'funds'
                    for an attorney, the state would
                    provide you with one -- free of
                    charge.   If that's what you
                    wanted.

       Goldberg sits down on the edge of Sherman's desk.
                                  SHERMAN
                    Well, look. I guess what I should
                    do is, I should... I should talk
                    this over with an attorney.

                    ... But mainly, it's the look on
                    his face. Ain't that the truth,
                    Marty?

                    Yeah. I got an idea. We take a
                    picture of Sherman McCoy over to
                    the hospital, to this kid. And
                    three or four other guys, white
                    guys, and we put them by the bed,
                    the pictures. And the kid comes
                    to... and he points to McCoy's
                    picture. And he keeps pointing...
       Nobody believes what they're hearing -- except Kramer.

                    Might work. That might work. It's
                    a long shot, but it might work.

       An AIDE rushes up to Kramer and pulls him aside.

                    You'll kill him. He wakes up out
                    of a coma and sees four white men
                    in suits and ties staring at him
                    from the end of the bed, he'll

                Sounds to me like he's got good

                just sit tight. That's what you

                   Look, you were recommended as the
                   best criminal lawyer around. I'm
                   not disagreeing with you. But I
                   didn't come here to... I mean, I

                                 KILLIAN

                                 SHERMAN
                   It means I want to take the
                   initiative. I want to go to the
                   police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin
                   -- and just tell them exactly what
                   happened. I mean, I don't know
                   about the law, but I feel morally
                   certain that we did what was right
                   -- in the situation we were in.

                That's right. Well, I don't know

                   six blocks home and it is going to
                   cost us three hundred and forty-six
                   dollars?! We are hemorrhaging money,
                   Judy. It is pouring out of us with
                   every beat of our heart. Isn't that
                   worth talking about?!?

                   You're right. It might be cheaper
                   in the long run to hire a
                   permanent chauffeur.

                   Sherman, this is a very important
                   evening. It will determine

      "repent." The Don refuses. The MUSIC THUNDERS

                   I don't think it will be too bad.
                   My lawyer -- if you can call him
                   that -- has received assurances
                   that it will all be handled in an
                   orderly fashion.
                                 MARIA
                   He called me a whore today. Right
                   in front of the servants. I mean,
                   really. How does he expect me to
                   run the house if he humiliates me
                   in front of the help?

                                   SHERMAN
                   Yes.   Well.   You have a point.
                                 MARIA
                   I'm sorry, Sherman.    What are we
                   talking about?
                                 SHERMAN
                   The other guy has come forward.
                   He says I was driving the car.
                   I'm going to be arrested tomorrow
                   morning. I need to know from you
                   ... I mean, what do you want me
                   to say?
                                 MARIA
                   Oh, Sherman, what...?!

      But MRS. BAVARDAGE swirls up to them and whisks the now
      terrified Maria away.

                                 MRS. BAVARDAGE
                   Maria, darling, I need your advice
                   about something. My designer has
                   gone bonkers about jabots and chintz.

       As she leaves with Maria, she grabs Aubrey Buffing and
       steers him toward Sherman.

                                  MRS. BAVARDAGE
                    Sherman, have you met Aubrey
                    Buffing? He has AIDS.

                    and retribution waiting for us. Yet

                    itself takes us into his arms and
                    burns us with the fever of living,
                    dragging us like Don Juan into the
                    bonfires of hell. The words of the

                             MARTIN
               Be careful of your clothes. My
               kid got all this Styrofoam shit
               back there. They stick to your
               clothes.

               How do you feel?

               Top notch. Look. You said this
               was just a formality.
                              KILLIAN
               No problem.   They promised me.
                            SHERMAN
               I told Maria. I saw her last
               night. In case we need her.
                             KILLIAN
               That explains it. She left the
               country this morning. You know
               some Italian painter named Filippo
               Sharutti, something like that?
                               SHERMAN
               I don't know.    Why?

                             KILLIAN
               I think your girl friend found
               a new boyfriend.

               But...

                             KILLIAN
               It's not going to be so bad. This
               is routine. I talked to Andruitti
               again last night. He promised me.
               We'll be in and out of there. No
               problem. Nobody is ever going to
               know it happened.
                             MARTIN
               We got to cuff him.

                 What the fuck? Wait a minute.
                 Come here. Bend over.
       Sherman looks terrified.
                               GOLDBERG
                 I ain't going to touch you. Just
                 bend over at the waist and back
                 through the gate. Real slow.
       Sherman bends over at a ninety-degree angle and, holding
       up his trousers, shuffles backwards through the gate.
                               GOLDBERG
                 Slow. Slow. Slow. A little
                 farther, little farther. Little
                 farther. Little farther...
       As Sherman's head goes through the gate, the ALARM
       SOUNDS. Goldberg jumps up and down and claps his hands
       with delight.

                                GOLDBERG
                 Hey, Martin.   Come here.   Look
                 at this.

       Martin approaches.
                               GOLDBERG
                 Okay, Sherman. Do that again.
                 Real slow.

       Sherman repeats the humiliating action. When finally
       his head reaches the gate, the ALARM SOUNDS again.

                                  GOLDBERG
                    It's his head! Swear to Christ.
                    It's his head. Open your mouth.

       Sherman opens his mouth. Goldberg grabs his jaw and
       angles it toward the light.
                                  GOLDBERG
                    Look in there. You want to see

      is led quickly toward the cells. His shoes flop, his
      pants sag, he trips and almost falls. A cell door opens.
      Sherman is pushed inside. He turns to look back. The

                    It was too much for me. All of it.
                    Sherman McCoy had been swept away
                    from me. Before I could even speak
                    to him. And as the day progressed,
                    I began to appreciate the power, the

                    unleashed by my little story.

                    Uh. I don't normally ride the
                    subway.
                                 PETER
                    Me either. Especially on a first
                    date. But we don't really have a
                    choice.

       Sherman is dazed, still in shock.       He looks very
       fragile.

                                  PETER
                    Are you alright?
                                   SHERMAN
                    Oh, fine.   Yes, thanks.
                                  PETER
                    Look, I owe you an apology...
                                  SHERMAN
                    No, you were very helpful.
                                  PETER
                    You don't know who I am.
                                  SHERMAN
                    That's alright. Thanks.     I should
                    go.
                                  PETER
                    Go where?

                                  SHERMAN
                    Well...

                                 PETER
                    Look. Sit down. Just sit down a
                    minute. I'll get you home.                              *

       They do.   Peter offers Sherman his bottle.

                                  PETER
                    Would you like a drink? I happen
                    to have a little something...

       Sherman looks with some caution at the bottle in the
       paper bag.

                                 PETER
                    Go on. Fuck it. What are they
                    going to do? Arrest you?

       Sherman smiles and takes a drink.         He looks around the
       car. It's a rough crowd.
                                  SHERMAN
                    Does this train go anywhere near
                    Park Avenue?
                                  PETER
                    Not in a million years.

                                  SHERMAN

                    day of his life.                                           *

                                    SHERMAN
                    No.
       They both laugh.
                                  SHERMAN
                    I look terrible.
                                  PETER
                    You look like shit.       And you smell,
                    too.

                                  SHERMAN
                    I think, when I was in the jail,
                    I pissed in my pants.

       They laugh again. Sherman gets caught somewhere between
       laughing and crying. He starts to lose control.
                                    PETER
                    Take it easy.

                                    SHERMAN
                    I'm alright.

                                    PETER
                    Yeah.

        as the car slows down.     Sherman is slightly drunk.
                                   SHERMAN
                     ... and then this newspaper thing
                     started, this Peter Fallow person,
                     and all the facts were wrong, total
                     disregard for the truth. Why do
                     they do this?
                                   PETER
                     This is you. You'll be right on
                     Lexington Avenue.

                                   SHERMAN
                     They call me by my first name.
                     Like they know me. Like they own
                     me. Newspapers, lawyers, police,
                     people I don't even know. How did
                     I get to be so important?
                                   PETER
                     You're not important. You're just
                     dinner. You know what I mean? And
                     a week from now, a month -- nobody
                     is even going to remember what they
                     ate.

        The car stops. Sherman steps onto the platform.        Peter
        remains in the car. Sherman looks back at him.

                                   SHERMAN
                     I should have called the police
                     right away, when it happened. But
                     I couldn't you see? It wasn't
                     really my decision.

                                   PETER

                   This is a dinner party. It was
                   planned weeks ago. If you ever
                   bothered to look at your calendar...

                   it. That was before the
                   Kittridges. I hope I'm not being

                   I find people often need to be as

                   situations and I know I can get
                   you seven-and-a-half right at
                   this moment. Fabled aristocratic
                   tycoon -- it's the celebrity

                   quickly this kind of opportunity
                   doesn't come along every day. You

                   Here it is.
                                 POLLARD
                   Sherman, we've known each other
                   a long time. We went to Buckley
                   together. My father knew your
                   father. I speak as a friend. But
                   also as president of the board.
                   Is that a gun?
                                 SHERMAN
                   I wonder if I can get both barrels
                   into my mouth. That's what I was
                   thinking. And how do you pull the
                   trigger. I read somewhere about a
                   man who took off his shoe and
                   pulled the trigger with his toe.

                                 POLLARD
                   Yes. This can't be a comfortable
                   situation for you.

                   Exactly. Yes. Have you
                   considered... changing residence
                   until things quiet down?

                   They won't travel without their
                   animals. We had to put plastic
                   in the cabins. You know, they
                   urinate, they defecate...
                                PETER
                   Yes.

                   Anyway, the plane goes off the
                   runway and we hit the sand with
                   a hell of a jolt and the right
                   wing tip digs into the sand and
                   the plane skids around in a circle!
                   360 degrees before we stop! We're
                   scared shitless. Panic. And we
                   look into the cabin and there's
                   everybody calm, quiet, they're
                   picking up their luggage and their
                   animals and they're looking out
                   the window at the little fire that
                   started on the wing and they're
                   waiting for the doors to open like
                   nothing happened. And then it
                   dawns on me. They think this is
                   normal!
      He starts to laugh as he talks.

                                 ARTHUR
                   They think this is the way you
                   stop an airplane.

                   You stick one wing in the sand and
                   you spin around until you stop.
                          (coughing as he laughs
                           harder and harder)
                   What do they know? They never
                   rode in an airplane. They think
                   this is how you do it!
      Peter tries to laugh with Arthur. But Arthur's coughing
      turns into a spasm. He pushes his head back against
      the banquette. He seems to be humming. And then his
      head drops forward and he slumps against Peter.
                                  PETER
                   Arthur?   Arthur?

      He tries to signal a waiter.
                                  PETER
                   Excuse me.   Hello? Excuse me.
                   Waiter!!!
      The Maitre d' approaches the table.
                                 PETER
                   Mr. Ruskin seems to have suffered
                   some kind of -- well, I don't
                   know.
                                 MAITRE D'
                          (very disappointed)
                   Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

                                 PETER
                   I think you'd better call someone.

      Arthur drops forward suddenly, his face hitting his
      plate. A woman at the next table squeals.
                                 MAITRE D'
                          (annoyed)
                   Freddy? Attention, s'il vous
                   plait!

      Two waiters   help the Maitre d' pull the table out.
      Arthur slips   off his plate and falls onto the floor.
      Some people   notice. But, in general, the activity
      in the room   continues.

      The Maitre d' gives orders to the waiters.

      A MAN approaches Peter.

                   Excuse me, Monsieur Roberts. You
                   are not a doctor. And there are
                   legal complications.

                                 PETER
                   Well, somebody has to do something.
      Peter tries to perform the Heimlich maneuver on Ruskin.
                                 MAITRE D'
                   We have called the police. An
                   ambulance is coming. There is
                   nothing more we can do. Would

                          (to Peter)
                   Gee, buddy. I think he's dead.
      Peter lets go of Ruskin.    Ruskin slides to the floor --
      dead.
                                MAITRE D'

                    presentation of my person should
                    be carefully designed. As a model
                    to black mothers everywhere, I
                    think I should have the right
                    wardrobe. So if you could have
                    Mr. Fox's limousine pick me up in
                    the morning, I could do some
                    shopping.

                                  FOX
                    Why certainly.
                                  ANNIE
                    I'll need some furniture, too.
                    And a new refrigerator.
                    And although I should probably
                    continue to live in that shithole
                    of an apartment at least until
                    after the lawsuit is settled, I
                    would like to start looking now
                    for a co-op in Manhattan -- for me
                    and my son -- something with a view
                    of the river and preferably in a
                    neighborhood that is at least
                    upwardly mobile.
       Pause as they all look at her.

                 was touched to the depths of what
                 was left of my soul... and my bank

                                  SHERMAN

                    You seem to be doing all your
                    talking to the newspapers these
                    days.
                                  SHERMAN
                    Believe me, I had nothing to do
                    with that. We didn't want your
                    name in the papers any more than
                    you did.

                                  MARIA
                    I see. Well, here we are,
                    Sherman. The couple that all New
                    York is talking about. And we're
                    not even a couple anymore.

                                  SHERMAN
                    I thought you'd run out  on me. I
                    didn't even know where  you went.
                    And I was left sort of  holding the
                    bag, trying to protect  you.

                                 MARIA
                    Oh, Sherman. Would I do that to
                    you? Sherman, Sherman, Sherman.
       She embraces him, her hands moving toward the hidden
       recorder. Sherman takes both her hands and pulls them
       to his chest.
                                  MARIA
                    What are we going to do with you?

                    You have to help me, Maria.
                                  MARIA
                    But how can I help you?
                                  SHERMAN
                    Well, I know this may sound like
                    a strange request, but you could
                    start by telling the police what
                    really happened.

                                  MARIA
                    Oh, Sherman, you are the sweetest
                    thing. But I'm not sure anybody
                    knows what really happened. Not
                    anymore. And if anybody does
                    know, it certainly isn't me.
                                  SHERMAN
                    But you were driving the car that
                    night.
                                  MARIA
                    Was I? I don't remember. Isn't
                    it funny how a little thing like
                    that can slip your mind?
                           (she kisses him)
                    God, there's something about
                    funerals that is so stimulating.
                    My panties have been wet all
                    morning.

                                  SHERMAN

       She kisses him again.

      More silence.    He comes down off the bench, facing the
      mob.

                                 JUDGE
                   I'll tell you what justice is not.
                   Justice is not the will of the few
                   and it's not the will of the many.
                   Justice is not politics. Justice
                   is the law. And the law is man's
                   feeble attempt to set down the
                   principles of decency. Decency!
                   And decency is not a deal. Or an
                   angle, or a contract, or a hustle
                   or a campaign or a trick or a bid
                   for sympathy. Decency is not the
                   beast that bays for money, power,
                   dominion, position, votes and
                   blood! Decency is what your
                   mother taught you! Decency is
                   in your bones! Do I make myself
                   clear! Now go home. Go home now.
                   Be decent people. Be decent.
      A moment of quiet as White comes down and faces Sherman.
                                 JUDGE

      lying in his bed.  Perfectly still. And then his nose
      twitches. His hand  comes up and scratches his nose. His
      eyes open. He sits  up, looks around, figures where he
      is. He gets out of  bed, disconnects the I.V.
307   EXT. HOSPITAL - HENRY LAMB                                    307
      comes out of hospital, he smiles and walks away down
      the street.

          EXT JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With
          the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy
          receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced
          reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
          
          MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR.
          Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
          
          
          INT OFFICE- DAY
          
          A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen.
          MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink-
          stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have
          time for office parties, she's working.
          
          Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as
          he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm working, Stewart.
          
                              STEWART
                    Come on, take a break. (enticing)
                    I've got Kahlua...
          
          Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head.
          Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
          
                              CASS
                    Depends on what you got.
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    I've got a confirmed place and
                    time.
          
          Cass is on her feet, excited.
          
                              CASS
                    I love you! So, when? Where?
          
                                                                   2.
          
          
                              JIMMY (O.S.)
                    You think I'm gonna say this shit
                    over the phone? I could get killed.
                    Just meet me at the usual place.
                    Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost
                    an extra hundred.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
          
          
          INT NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
          
          Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:
          
                              STEWART
                    Where ya going?
          
                              CASS
                    Hooters. I go there for the hot
                    wings.
          
                              STEWART
                    Please. Nobody goes there for the
                    hot wings. You got a tip.
          
                              CASS
                    You got a hundred bucks on you?
          
          Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.
          
                              STEWART
                    Now are you gonna let me in on it?
          
                               CASS
                    Sorry. No can do. I have to protect
                    my source.
          
                              STEWART
                    You know what? We need to talk
                    about our relationship.
          
                              CASS
                    We don't have a relationship. We
                    made out 3 years ago in the copy
                    room. I was drunk. I was broken-
                    hearted. I would have made out with
                    the xerox machine.
          
                              STEWART
                    Yes, but you made out with me.
          
                              CASS
                    I have to go.
          
                                                                   3.
          
          
          She exits. He shouts after her:
          
                              STEWART
                    I want in on that story!
          
          
          EXT STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY
          
          Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves:
          TRACKING A STORY...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK
          CORNER OF THE LOT...
          
          INT JIMMY'S CAR- DAY
          
          JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his
          car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
          
          Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a
          lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT
          WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER,
          heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches
          through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...
          
          
          EXT DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
          
          Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, Jimmy, I...
          
          She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN
          GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
          
                                 CASS
                    Jimmy?
          
          SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S
          BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is
          racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED
          LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE
          GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.
          
                                                                   4.
          
          
          Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT
          BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the
          Chevy is getting away.
          
          Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE
          SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE
          PURSUIT...
          
          
          INT CASS' CAR- DAY
          
          Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic
          and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN.
          She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...
          
          
          EXT STREET- DAY
          
          CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT
          ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND
          BLOCKS HER IN.
          
          
          EXT CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by
          the arm:
          
                              CASS
                    Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm
                    warning you...
          
          The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and
          SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.
          
          FREEZE FRAME.
          
          CHIRON: "24 HOURS LATER"
          
          CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept
          hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the
          world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".
          
          Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER
          improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a
          MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.
          
                               VOICE

          PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
          
          INT CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy
          hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender
          (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    What did I say about the fires?
          
                              MILO
                    You said "please set fires in my
                    bar". Wait, no, that's not right.
                    "Please don't set fires in my bar".
                    (off her look) Ok, jeez, you try to
                    get in the holiday spirit...
          
          He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on
          it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.
          
                              CRYSTAL
                    Shouldn't you be working?
          
                              MILO
                    That's the beauty of my job,
                    Crystal. Tracking down idiots is
                    something you can do pretty much
                    anywhere. See, there's one...
          
          He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLY
          SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".
          
                              MILO
                    And there's another one...
          
          Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.
          
                              MILO
                    And there's...
          
          Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS
          PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. That idiot. (to
                    Crystal) Save my seat.
          
          Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.
          
                                                                      6.

          Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked
          windshield, bumper askew.
          
          RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.
          
          
          INT DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica
          t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    There you are, you dipshit.
          
          He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away
          from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.
          
          
          EXT JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in
          Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A
          boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like
          orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
          
          A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
          
          RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways
          into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO
          climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to
          the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
          
          Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd
          impatiently.
          
          Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block
          away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
          
          MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer
          are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who
          does a double-take.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you
                    fucking ding-dong.
          
          Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN
          MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    We have to stop meeting this way.
          
                                                                      7.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Not now, Dwight.

                    You owe my boss money.
          
                              MILO
                        (LAUGHING)
                    Hey, I owe everybody money.
          
          Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up,
          gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON
          THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE
          BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
          
          The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE
          REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS
          DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working
          their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and
          Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid
          Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES
          RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
          
          All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER
          STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS
          SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON
          RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT
          CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:
          
                              MILO
                        (BEAMING)
                    I am so happy you did that.
          
          Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people
          scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:
          
                              BOY
                    That man is killing Rudolph!
          
          SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and
          Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over-
          zealous) steps forward:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Release the reindeer!
          
          Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so
          guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO
          STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hands behind your head, asshole!
          
                                                                     8.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy, skippy, I'm just
                    doing my job.
          
          Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't
                    you get a real job?
          
                              MILO
                    So I can be like you patrol boys
                    and sit around all day with my
                    thumb up my ass?
          
          Gelman turns bright red.
          
                              GELMAN
                    What did you just say?
          
          Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but
          likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes
          one look at Milo and laughs.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Sarg, you know this asshole?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used
                    to be one of us.
          
          RACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW...
          
          
          EXT STREET- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby
          follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Look, Milo, I know this is a tough
                    time of year for you...
          
                              MILO
                    This isn't a tough time of year for
                    me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't
                    love Christmas?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...and I try to be sensitive to
                    your situation...
          
                                                                    9.
          
          
                              MILO
                    What situation? Being a man who
                    works his own hours and has his
                    freedom and lives the high life?
          
                              BOBBY
                    ...because I realize you're
                    unhappy.
          
                              MILO
                    Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob?
                    Look at me: I'm the happiest man
                    alive.
          
          Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE.
          Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:
          
                              BOBBY
                    That sign is pretty hard to see.
          
          And with that, Milo loses it:
          
                              MILO
                    AAAHHH!
          
          He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries
          to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like
          the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
          
                              RUDOLPH
                    Take me to jail. Please?
          
          
          INT BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
          
          Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children,
          all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
          
          Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't
                    Santa have any children? Cause he
                    only comes once a year and when he
                    does, it's down a chimney.
          
          Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.
          
                              BOBBY
                    So. Have you talked to her lately?
          
                              MILO
                    Talked to who?
          
                                                                  10.

                    Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do
                    you think?
          
                              MILO
                    I haven't talked to her in three
                    years, why would I talk to her now?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Well, for one thing, so you can
                    stop taking out your rage on
                    innocent bystanders.
          
                              RUDOLPH
                        (piping up from the back)
                    Talk to her, man. For real.
          
          Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Do what you want. But this kind of
                    shit will eat a hole in your
                    intestines, you don't deal with it.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENING
          
          They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the
          back. Bobby leans out.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Hey, why don't you come by the
                    precinct tomorrow for our Xmas
                    bash?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm not invited. I'm not a cop
                    anymore, remember?
          
                              BOBBY
                    Fuck that, I'm inviting you.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.
          
                              BOBBY
                    That's what I'm worried about.
                    (sighing) Just...take it easy, Ok?
          
          Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby
          drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with
          some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.
          
                                                                   11.

                    Do I look like I need advice from a
                    grown man in antlers?
          
          Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.

          INT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal
          desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound
          sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:
          
                              SID
                    You're drooling on my sofa.
          
          Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles
          upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?

                    You do have an apartment, don't
                    you? With a bed of some kind?
          
          Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.

                    Heard you shut down 5th Street
                    yesterday. Gave every kid in the

                              MILO
                    Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy.
                    Anyway, what do you care? I brought
                    your guy in, right?
          
          Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS
          PALM.
          
          
          EXT SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
          
          Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree
          into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree
          is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.
          
                                                                 12.

                    You gonna give me a hand, or just
                    stand there killing your liver?
          
                              MILO
                    Is that a trick question?
          
          Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs
          part of the tree.
          
                              SID
                    So I told her, fine, I'd handle
                    Xmas this year. I mean, what's to
                    handle? You buy a tree, some gifts,
                    cook a ham, hang some lights. An
                    idiot could do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, we'll soon find out.
          
          Sid checks him out.
          
                              SID
                    You have plans for the holiday?
          
                                 MILO
                    The usual.
          
                              SID
                    Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and
                    put your fist through a wall?
          
                                 MILO
                    Jealous?
          
          The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and
          Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
          
                              SID
                    Then forget it.
          
                              MILO

                    give it to Doug instead.
          
          Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
          
                                                                 13.

                    The truth is, I'm not sure you're
                    the right person for this job. It
                    could be a total disaster. On the
                    other hand, when one friend sees
                    another friend stagnating in his
                    own filth, he has to do something,
                    right?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna
                    shower.
          
          Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in.
          Phew. Sid slams the back shut.
          
                              SID
                    Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
          
          He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF
          PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick
          look. A second look. A third.
          
          TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.

                              MILO
                    She got arrested? And then she
                    jumped bail?
          
                              SID
                    Apparently the whole thing started
                    with some reckless driving, and
                    ended with her assaulting a police
                    officer.
          
          Milo gives him a questioning look.

                    Yeah. That sounds like her.
                    But here's my question: why the
                    hell did you post her bail?

                              MILO
                    No, not "whatever". I dumped her.
          
                              SID
                    The point is, I'm aware you guys
                    have issues, but I'm running a
                    business here. A person needs bail,
                    I don't have time to check with you
                    first.
          
                              MILO
                    Well, had you checked with me
                    first, you wouldn't be out of a
                    bond right now.

                    pick her up. It's five grand to
                    bring her back by 9am, Xmas day.

                    You're a good listener.
          
          Milo takes a deep, calming breath. Then he EXPLODES into
          whoops and hollers. He throws himself into a snow bank and
          thrashes around. He does a Fred Astaire around a lamp post.
          
                              SID
                    I take it you're interested.
          
          Milo grabs Sid and pulls him into a crushing bear hug.
          
                              MILO
                    I love you! You're the best friend
                    a guy could ever have!

                    Ok, take it easy...
          
          TERESA (mid 40's, overly made-up, popping gum) pokes her head
          out the front door:
          
                              TERESA
                    Sid, you got a DUI on line one.
                    (off their looks) What's going on?
          
          Milo drops Sid, grabs Teresa, and gives HER A LONG, INTENSE
          KISS. He releases her. She stumbles back a bit.
          
                              TERESA
                    Ok. (beat) Can I have my gum back?
          
                              MILO
                    Right. Sorry.
          
          He reaches into his mouth, extracts her gum and hands it to
          her. She retreats back inside. Milo beams at Sid.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what this is, don't you?
                    Karma! Payback! You know how they
                    say "What goes around comes

                              MILO
                    We didn't break up over a stupid
                    article. We broke up because she is
                    a cheating, manipulative liar.
          
                              SID
                    Are you sure you can handle this?
          
                              MILO
                    Why wouldn't I be able to handle
                    this?
          
                              SID
                    Let's face it: you're not exactly
                    rational around her. I mean, if I
                    was a cop working a case and some
                    reporter came snooping around, I'd
                    say "no comment". Not "no comment,
                    but care for a cocktail"? And then
                    a month later, running off to some
                    love shack called "Caveman's Cabin"
                    and tying the knot? Who does that?
          
                              MILO
                    That's not even close to what
                    happened. For one thing, it was
                    called "Cupid's Cabin". And for
                    another, that was before I knew how
                    conniving she was. Now I know. So
                    all I have to do is track her down,
                    cuff her up, and bring her in.
                    (checking his watch) And I've got,
                    what, two days? Shit, man. Easy as

          sheet and inspects it. CASS' CELL PHONE NUMBER IS LISTED.
          Pulls out his cell phone, then hesitates. He glances around
          and sees a PAY PHONE ACROSS THE WAY.

          for them to pass, when her phone rings.
          
          She checks it ("PAY PHONE") and answers:

          crosses Milo's face. Cass goes pale.

          the heavy door..

          Milo appears next to the woman and holds the door for her:
          
                              MILO
                    Nice dog. Very compact.
          
          The woman exits and Milo enters.

          Milo stops in front of 303, and knocks on the door.
          
                                 MILO
                    Candygram.
          
          No answer. Milo glances around, then works the lock...
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's
          dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out.
          The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV.
          
          And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS,
          PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a
          successful and dedicated journalist.
          
                                                                    20.
          
          
          Milo is halfway across the room when he realizes he has left
          a set of MUDDY PRINTS across the formerly pristine white rug.
          
                              MILO
                    Whoops.

          Cass enters frame. Nervous looks all around as she tries the
          knob. Surprise: THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN. She hesitates.
          
          
          INT APARTMENT/LIVING-ROOM- DAY
          
          NOW THERE ARE FOOTPRINTS CRISS-CROSSING THE FLOOR, RUNNING UP
          OVER THE COUCH, ETC. Looks like Milo had a little field day
          here. He is taking a closer look at the shelves: no photos of
          a boyfriend, family, pets: IT'S ALL WORK.
          
          He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline
          "LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG
          RING". There's a photo of CASS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE AN
          IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.
          
          Milo's face clouds over.

          Milo's head whips around. SOMEONE'S IN THE KITCHEN. Big grin
          as he replaces the frame and draws his gun. A couple careful
          steps across the room and a floorboard CREAKS.

          Cass startles. SOMEONE'S IN THE LIVING-ROOM. Grabs a heavy
          saucepan off the stove. Grips it like a weapon, soft-foots it
          towards the hallway...

          Milo holds his breath. A SHADOWY FIGURE STEPS INTO THE ROOM.
          Milo puts his gun to their head:
          
                              MILO
                    `Allo, love.

          off wall, lands on the coffee table, fangs bared.

                    to do one thing, and you want to do
                    another, and you compromise by
                    doing what she wants?
          
                              SID
                    Exactly. Now just get her here.
                    Cause I can't afford to lose this

          door shut. Milo waits. After a moment, Lois opens it again.

          Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND
          EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look.

                    means to waste a woman's child-
                    bearing years? It's criminal. Every

                    just a girl who wants to be

                    named Leslie, now gets invited to

                              MILO
                    Invigorating.
          
                              CASS
                        (can't hold out anymore)
                    What are you doing here?
          
          Milo smirks.
          
                              MILO
                    "Building a sand castle, drinking
                    from a coconut". Man, once a liar,
                    always a liar.
          
          Cass immediately stands.
          
                              CASS
                    You know what? I don't have time
                    for this, I'm working.
          
          She grabs her stuff. Milo blocks her with his leg.
          
                              MILO
                    Working? Hey, me too.
          
                              CASS
                    Congratulations. Move your leg.
          
          Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:
          
                              MILO
                    What I do is, I track down
                    criminals. People who jumped bail.
                    Idiots who decided to go on the run
                    after biting police officers. I
                    find them, and I take them to jail.
          
                                                                  33.
          
          
          Cass stares at him, eyes wide:
          
                              CASS
                    Now, hold on just a second, Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Tell you what: I'll give you more
                    than a second. I'll give you 10.
                    For old times sake.
          
          Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.
          
                              MILO
                    10...9...8...
          
          Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to
          do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE
          LOUDSPEAKERS ANNOUNCE: "AND THEY'RE OFF!"
          
          
          EXT RACETRACK PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass jumps into her car and turns the key. NOTHING. She tries
          again, then hears soft laughter. MILO IS SEVERAL YARDS AWAY,
          HER BATTERY IN HIS HAND.
          
                              MILO
                    Strike one.
          
          Cass leaps from the car and runs.
          
          
          INT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass runs for the elevator. It opens and people exit,
          REVEALING MILO:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike two.
          
          Cass turns heel and bolts.
          
          
          EXT STADIUM- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass races out, flagging a taxi. Milo pulls up:
          
                              MILO
                    Strike three. Get in.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going to jail, Milo.
          
                                                                     34.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I beg to differ.
          
          She heads for the cabs. Milo exits his car, GUN IN HAND.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh please. Like you're gonna shoot
                    me.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. (loudly) I'm gonna shoot a
                    cab driver.
          
          Head whip around in his direction. THEN EVERY CAB IN THE
          PLACE GOES OFF-DUTY. Cass stomps her foot, furious.
          
                              CASS
                    Chicken shits.
          
          Cass marches back over to Milo.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look: let's talk about this.
          
                               MILO
                    Ok.
          
          With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND
          THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS
          INCHES APART.
          
          Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels
          weird. Confused.
          
                              CASS
                        (UNCOMFORTABLE)
                    Listen, Milo, I'm not sure we
                    should...
          
          Suddenly, MILO DUMPS HER IN THE TRUNK OF HIS CAR.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, wait a minute!
          
          He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Well, now she knows exactly how she feels:
          FURIOUS:
          
                               CASS (O.S.)
                    Bastard.

          And immediately: A PHONE RINGS.
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Great. Perfect timing.
          
          A match is struck, illuminating the trunk as Cass scrambles
          for her phone. Trying to sound professional:
          
                              CASS
                    Cassidy Daley.

          CLOSE ON- JIMMY, head tilted back, tense smile on his face.
          PULL BACK a little to reveal the GUN MAHLER IS HOLDING UNDER
          HIS CHIN.
          
                              JIMMY
                    It's me. Jimmy.
          
                              CASS
                        (exhaling with relief)
                    Shit, Jimmy, I thought you were
                    dead.
          
                              JIMMY
                    Don't be silly. (hurrying on)
                    Listen: you didn't happen to go to
                    my place and find that envelope I
                    left, did you?
          
                              CASS
                    I did, but I don't really get it,
                    what's "Sparrow"?
          
                              JIMMY
                    It doesn't matter. Did you tell
                    anyone else about this story?
          
                              CASS
                    Are you kidding? You think I want
                    to share a story like this?
          
                              JIMMY
                    Ok. Good. Cause the truth is, there
                    is no story. I made the whole thing
                    up. So you should just drop it...
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-uh, no way are you backing out
                    on me now, Jimmy. This story is way
                    too good...
          
                                                                 36.

                        (QUICKLY)
                    Where are you?
          
                              CASS
                    I'm at the Atlantic City Boardwalk.
                    Actually, I'm in the trunk of my ex-
                    husband's car. Long story. More
                    importantly, where are you?
          
                                 JIMMY
                    I'm...
          
          CLICK. MAHLER DISCONNECTS THE PHONE.
          
          ON CASS- she stares at her phone. Uh-oh:
          
                              CASS
                    Jimmy? Hello?
          
          Suddenly, MUSIC KICKS IN and we hear MILO SINGING AT THE TOP
          OF HIS LUNGS:
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Deck the halls with boughs of

          Now Milo really is the happiest man alive. He pulls out his
          cell phone, dials:

          Teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse-pad, answers:

                              MILO
                    Guess who's in my trunk?
          
                              TERESA
                    Is that some sort of perverted
                    innuendo? Who is this?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, come on, Teresa, you know it's
                    me. Put Sid on.
          
                                                                 37.

                    thinks he can handle Xmas.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just tell him I got her and
                    I'll be back in 2 hours. I want a
                    bonus for bringing her in so quick.
          
                              TERESA
                    Yeah? I want a bonus for getting
                    through the holidays without
                    stabbing anyone with a fork.
          
                              MILO
                    Don't be such a pessimist. You
                    still have time.
          
          His phone beeps. IT'S CASS CALLING FROM THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    Gotta go. I got another call.
          
          He clicks over.
          
                              MILO
                    Tina's Thai massage! Where every
                    ending is a happy one!

          Cass rolls her eyes.
          
                               CASS
                    You're disgusting. Let me out of
                    the trunk.
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Nope. By the way, your
                    boyfriend Stewart's been following
                    me. Unfortunately, I had to ditch
                    him at the track.
          
                              CASS
                    Why is Stewart..? (realizing) And
                    wait: who said he's my boyfriend?
          
                              MILO
                    Aw, don't be embarrassed. These
                    things happen. You were drunk when
                    you guys hooked up, right?
          
          Cass turns bright red. She was drunk when they hooked up.
          Changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:
          
                                                                  38.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what, Milo? I shouldn't
                    have run from you like that. I
                    was...I don't know. You caught me
                    off-guard. The truth is, I'm kind
                    of in some trouble and I could
                    really use your help.
          
                              MILO
                    Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't
                    help you if you were the very last
                    baby sea turtle in the world,
                    dragging its tiny weak body across
                    the burning hot sand while sea
                    gulls circled overhead. I'd just
                    pull up a chair, sip a pina colada,
                    and let nature take its course.
          
          Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL
          SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical
          interest, then:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no
                    more. You can cry til the cows come
                    home, for all I care.
          
          Cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.
          
          CUT TO BLACK. Then, the sound of a trunk opening, and WE ARE
          INSIDE A CAR TRUNK, LOOKING UP AT: MAHLER.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO PARKING LOT- AFTERNOON
          
          Mahler reaches into his trunk and REMOVES HIS HANDGUN. Checks
          the cartridge, pockets the gun. Slams the trunk shut.
          
          He climbs into his front seat, and as he pulls out of the
          lot, we see CASS' NEWSPAPER PHOTO THAT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM
          THE PAPER, on the passenger seat.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo drives along happily humming when, suddenly, A SMALL
          TRAIL OF SMOKE drifts over his shoulder. What the hell...? He
          glances into the rearview mirror and:
          
          SMOKE IS POURING OUT OF THE TRUNK!
          
                              MILO
                    Holy shit! (calling out) Hey, um,
                    Cass? (no response) Cassidy?
          
                                                                  39.
          
          
          Still nothing. Milo jerks the car to the right, and SLAMS on
          the brakes.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          The car screeches to a halt on the embankment. Milo leaps out
          of the driver's door and races to back, fumbling with his
          keys. SMOKE CONTINUES TO POUR OUT OF THE TRUNK.
          
                              MILO
                    It's Ok, hang on, I'm coming...
          
          Gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: CASS, HANDKERCHIEF
          OVER HER NOSE, PACK OF FLAMING MATCHES IN HAND. Cass tosses
          the matches and handkerchief, AND PUNCHES MILO IN THE BALLS.
          
          Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the
          trunk and stands over him:
          
                              CASS
                    You know something, Milo? You're
                    one of the most gullible...
          
          BAM, Milo grabs her ankle and JERKS and Cass hits the ground.
          Next thing you know, IT'S WWF TIME, THE TWO OF THEM ROLLING
          IN THE DIRT.
          
          Milo gets her pinned, but Cass grabs his ear and TWISTS:
          
                                 MILO
                    AAAAHHH...
          
          He pulls her arm behind her back...
          
                              CASS
                    Ow ow ow...
          
          ...and she jerks her head back, SMACKING him in the nose.
          
                              MILO
                    Son of a...
          
          He gets her in a BEAR HUG...
          
                                 CASS
                    AAGH...
          
          ...and she BITES him.
          
                                 MILO
                    OW...
          
                                                                  40.
          
          
          Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face
          right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM
          HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.
          
                              CASS
                    NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!
          
          Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She
          looks at him and she starts laughing too.
          
                              CASS
                    Dirty fighter.
          
                              MILO
                    Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
          
          They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a
          hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as
          they look at each other.
          
                               CASS
                    Should we...I don't know...hug, or
                    something?
          
                              MILO
                    Sure. What the hell.
          
          He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her
          hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK.
          HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. I had to try, right?
          
                              MILO
                    Get in the car.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF
          CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos
          as they head out of Atlantic City.
          
                              CASS
                    Your windshield's cracked.
          
                              MILO
                    Thanks, Captain Obvious.
          
          Cass turns to inspect him more closely.
          
                                                                  41.
          
          
                               CASS
                    And you look like shit, Milo. What
                    have you been doing, sleeping on
                    the floor?
          
          Milo has been sleeping on the floor.
          
                              MILO
                    I enjoy sleeping on the floor.
                    Matter of fact, I love sleeping on
                    the floor. I love everything about
                    my life. Great job, good friends,
                    hot girlfriend...
          
                              CASS
                    You have a girlfriend?
          
                              MILO
                        (he does not)
                    Yes I do.
          
          Cass is skeptical:
          
                              CASS
                    Really? What's her name?
          
                              MILO
                        (the first name that pops
                         into his head:)
                    Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to
                    cook pasta for me and perform strip-
                    teases.
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, she has all her chromosomes,
                    believe you me.
          
          Cass thinks this over, then counters:
          
                              CASS
                    Well, my life is great, too.
          
                              MILO
                    I can tell. You and Stewart make a
                    great couple, by the way. You and
                    me made a terrible couple. But you
                    two? Like peas in a pod.
          
          About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to
          Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:
          
                                                                  42.
          
          
                              CASS
                    You know what I like about Stewart?
          
                              MILO
                    I can't imagine.
          
                              CASS
                    He's not you.
          
                              MILO
                    Not even on his best day.
          
                              CASS
                    Or his worst.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll bet he has a lot of those.
          
                              CASS
                    Still betting, huh?
          
                              MILO
                    You can't win if you don't play.
          
                              CASS
                    Or, in your case, even if you do.
          
          He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.
          
                              MILO
                    I win all the time.
          
                              CASS
                    Really? I hadn't noticed.
          
          Ok. That is definitely a challenge.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what? Seeing as how I'm
                    about to come into five grand...
          
          Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the
          parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                               MILO
                    I think I'll do a little betting
                    right now.
          
                              CASS
                    Don't you have to take me back?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I have two days. A monkey
                    could get you back in two days.
          
                                                                 43.
          
          
          Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to
          herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She
          glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING
          OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo opens her door.
          
                              CASS
                    Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
          
                                 MILO
                    Nope.
          
          He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart is heading back to the city, cursing his bad luck,
          when he happens to glance over and see MILO AND CASS HEADING
          INTO BALLY'S CASINO.
          
                              STEWART
                    Damn, I'm good!
          
          He makes a quick turn off the highway and into the Bally's
          parking lot.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO- AFTERNOON
          
          The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass
          APPROACH:
          
                              CLERK
                    Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
          
          Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...
          
                              CLERK
                    What a nice surprise! Let's hope
                    your luck is better today.
          
          Milo glances at Cass.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    Sure, if there's such a thing as
                    better than great, which is how my
                    luck has been lately. Great.
          
                                                                  44.

          While the clerk is counting out chips, WE NOTICE BEHIND HIM
          THE FEMALE CLERK PICKING UP THE PHONE...
          
          
          INT WAREHOUSE- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Lorraine on the phone, listening intently. Then she hangs up,
          grinning.

          Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next
          to him.
          
                              MILO
                    Prepare to observe the master.
          
          He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, how about this:
          
          She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:
          
                              CASS
                    If I give you all the cash in my
                    wallet, will you let me go?
          
                              MILO
                    Hmm. Lemme see...
          
                                                                 45.
          
          
          He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.
          
                              MILO
                    Nope. Guess not.
          
          Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.
          
                              MILO
                        (to the dealer)
                    Hit me.
          
                              CASS
                    I'd really like to.
          
          The dealer deals the cards.
          
                              DEALER
                    Dealer wins.
          
                              CASS
                    Nice going, master.
          
          Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells
          like an ashtray) appears:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    And for the couple over here?
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    We're not a couple.
          
                              CASS
                        (just as quick)
                    Why would you think we were a
                    couple?
          
                              MILO
                    We used to be together. Back when I
                    was young and foolish.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was confused.
          
                              MILO
                    And I was slumming.
          
                              CASS
                    And I was drunk.
          
          The waitress looks back and forth between them.
          
                                                                 46.
          
          
                              WAITRESS
                        (BORED)
                    Great story. I have to get back to
                    work now.
          
                              MILO
                    Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
          
          The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he
          has lost more money.
          
                              MILO
                        (under his breath)
                    Son of a bitch.
          
          Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:
          
                              CASS
                    Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom
                    is in the hospital.
          
          Milo perks up.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
          
                              CASS
                    She might be really sick. That's
                    why I had to jump bail.
          
                              MILO
                        (overly sincere)
                    Taking care of her, huh? Putting
                    aside your career for a loved one?
                    Golly, that's so you.
          
          "Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:
          
                              CASS
                    You've already been to see her.
          
                              MILO
                    Impressive. No wonder you got all
                    those awards. So lemme guess: the
                    real reason you jumped bail is
                    cause you're on a story.
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                    Stewart. Stewart told you.
          
                                                                 47.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (CAUGHT)
                    I would have figured it out on my
                    own, trust me.
          
                              CASS
                    I wouldn't trust you if you were
                    the last man alive.
          
                              MILO
                    You think about that much? Me being
                    the last man alive? Am I naked in
                    this fantasy?
          
          Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But
          she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, you're right. I'm on a story.
                    A very important story. It just so
                    happens that I'm possibly about to
                    uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
          
          Milo snorts.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop"
                    thing kind of old? Maybe you should
                    do a story about something people
                    are interested in. Like internet
                    porn. Or lesbians.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be
                    big. And here's what I'm willing to
                    do (magnanimous): I'm willing to
                    credit you in the article.
          
                              MILO
                    Oh, sure, like you credited me in
                    the 13th Street Article?
          
          Cass stares at him.
          
                              CASS
                    Why on earth would I have credited
                    you? I worked my ass off for that
                    story.
          
                              MILO
                    That's one way of putting it.
          
                                                                48.
          
          
                              CASS
                    What's that supposed to mean?
          
                              MILO
                    Forget it. I don't want to be in
                    your article. In fact, I would
                    rather eat a bowl of broken glass
                    than have my name in any way
                    associated with one of your lousy
                    articles...
          
                              CASS
                    Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
          
                              MILO
                    I already have.
          
                              CASS
                    I mean, you're not a cop anymore,
                    right? What do you care if people
                    were murdered?
          
                              MILO
                    Please. Nobody was murdered.
          
                              CASS
                    Just my source.

                    the head?
          
                              CASS

                              MILO
                    Car accident?
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered
                    yet. But I wouldn't be surprised
                    if...
          
          Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.
          
                                                                   49.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Maybe this whole thing sounds like
                    no big deal to you...
          
                              MILO
                    You know what it sounds like? It
                    sounds like you're going to jail.
          
          Cass can't believe this.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, you have to believe
                    me, come on, you know me...
          
                              MILO
                        (getting red)
                    Exactly! I do know you. Which means
                    I know you are a deceptive, cold-
                    hearted bitch who is going to jail
                    where she belongs.
          
          Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They
          stare at each other in silence.
          
          The waitress arrives with the drinks:
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Champagne. So. What are we
                    celebrating?
          
                              CASS
                        (GRIMLY)
                    I have to use the bathroom.
          
                              WAITRESS
                    Alrightee, then. Cheers.
          
          
          EXT BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door
          of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this
          parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over
          to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.
          
          IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.
          
          
          INT BALLY'S CASINO BATHROOM- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass enters and Milo follows:
          
                              CASS
                    Can I have some privacy, please?
          
                                                                  50.
          
          
          Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from
          here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:
          
                              MILO
                    I'm gonna have to frisk you.
          
                              CASS
                    Get it over with, then.
          
          Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind
          her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and
          checks her belly.
          
                              MILO
                    You gain a little weight?

          Milo reaches higher and:
          
                              CASS
                    Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in
                    my breasts.
          
          Milo backs off, turning red.
          
                              MILO
                    Make it quick.
          
          He exits. As soon as he is gone, CASS PULLS MILO'S TASER GUN
          FROM HER CLEAVAGE.

          up and sees: RAY, standing there, smiling at him.
          
                              STEWART
                    Shit, man, you startled me. (beat)

                    Night-night.
          
          Suddenly, Ray GRABS STEWART'S HEAD AND SMASHES IT INTO THE
          STEERING WHEEL, KNOCKING HIM OUT COLD.

          Cass squints at the taser gun, trying to read the tiny
          instruction label on the side:
          
                              CASS
                    "Put open end in direct contact
                    with skin. Press button..."
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm
                    coming in...
          
          He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS
          THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS
          THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.
          
          
          EXT CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          CASS RUNS OUT, BANGS INTO SOMEONE...
          
                               CASS
                    Sorry...
          
          ...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag
          down a ride.
          
          RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS
          STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the
          newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.
          
          Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS
          MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards
          her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?
          
                              VOICE
                    Need a lift?
          
          Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her.
          Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.
          
          RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't
          seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.
          
          
          INT TRUCK- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.
          
                                                                  52.
          
          
                              CASS
                    He says we made a terrible couple.
                    Which is true. I know that. I'm the
                    one who thought that first. I'm the
                    one who came up with that. The fact
                    is, I don't want to be with someone
                    who can't admit he was wrong.
          
                              DRIVER
                    So you're available.
          
          Cass looks at him. He smiles coyly.
          
                              CASS
                    Available for what?
          
                              DRIVER
                    I have a waterbed in my trailer.
          
                              CASS
                    I hope you don't think you're
                    telling me something that interests
                    me.
          
                              DRIVER
                    You know what I want for Xmas?
          
          The driver mouths something at her we can't see. Cass leans
          over and SMACKS HIM AS HARD AS SHE CAN.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass
          gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut
          behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.
          
          She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it
          down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but
          where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO
          BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on
          his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.
          
          She turns and STARTS TO RUN.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- LATE AFTERNOON
          
          Milo is laughing.
          
                              MILO
                    You better run.
          
                                                                  53.

          Cass runs into a field. Milo drives off the road and follows.
          He gets her cornered by a pen. He looks triumphant. She
          scowls. Then she throws open the pen, REVEALING A HUGE BULL.
          Now she looks triumphant. He scowls.
          
          CUT TO- BULL RAMS INTO MILO'S CAR, SLAMMING MILO'S FACE INTO
          THE STEERING WHEEL. CASS LAUGHS. THE BULL TURNS AND NOTICES
          CASS FOR THE FIRST TIME.
          
          CUT TO- BULL CHASES CASS. MILO LAUGHS. CASS RUNS FOR THE CAR.
          MILO LOCKS THE DOORS.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey, it's locked!
          
                              MILO
                        (GRINNING)
                    I know.
          
          THE BULL IS SPEEDING THEIR WAY:
          
                              CASS
                    Open the door, you son of a bitch!
          
          Finally, Milo opens it. She DIVES INTO THE CAR AND SLAMS THE
          DOOR just before the BULL RAMS INTO THE SIDE OF THE CAR.
          
          Cass and Milo watch, stunned, as the bull looks at them for a
          moment, THEN TOPPLES OVER, UNCONSCIOUS. Milo and Cass hear a
          strange sound, and look over to see A SMALL HERD OF BULLS,
          GETTING READY TO CHARGE.
          
                               CASS
                    Uh-oh...
          
          MILO HITS THE GAS AND THEY FLEE THE SCENE, THE HERD OF BULLS
          IN MAD PURSUIT. CASS AND MILO ARE BOTH NOW LAUGHING
          HYSTERICALLY...

          Ray THROWS open the bathroom door to reveal: A VERY
          DISGRUNTLED STEWART, HANDCUFFED TO THE TOILET. Stewart blinks
          up at them, disoriented.
          
          Lorraine hands Dwight THE GOLF CLUB.

                    He was in Milo Boyd's Cadillac.

                    Both of you go this time, and make
                    sure you get the right guy. I don't
                    have time for this shit.

          Lorraine considers him for a moment, then SLAMS the bathroom

          Milo and Cass are back on the highway, both looking a little
          worse for wear. Milo's nose is swollen, Cass' clothes are
          muddy.
          
                                                                 55.
          
          
          Milo MOVES HIS WEAPONS FROM THE DUFFLE INTO HIS OWN JACKET
          WHILE HE DRIVES. He smirks at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Clever. (noting all the weapons)
                    Wow. You were gonna use all that
                    stuff on me?
          
                              MILO
                    A guy can dream, can't he?
          
          NOW HIS JACKET IS FULL OF WEAPONS. He turns his attention
          back to the road. Cass studies his profile.
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, look, Milo, let's just clear
                    the air, Ok? So maybe it was a
                    mistake, thinking we could be
                    involved while working on the same
                    case...
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, I know it was a mistake. Don't
                    think you're telling me something I
                    don't know, cause you're not.
          
                              CASS
                        (deep breath)
                    Ok. Fine. But can we just put aside
                    our differences for two seconds?
                    Because back at the casino, I think
                    I saw someone following me.
          
                              MILO
                    Sure that wasn't me?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. This guy was
                    lacking your trademark smell of
                    booze and KFC.
          
                              MILO
                    Ha ha.
          
          Milo surreptitiously sniffs himself.
          
                              CASS
                    Anywho. If these dirty cops have my
                    source hostage somewhere...
          
          Milo starts to laugh. Cass flushes:
          
                              CASS
                    What's so funny?
          
                                                                  56.
          
          
                              MILO
                    You think dirty cops are trying to
                    kill you? Look, I know you think
                    you're hot shit and everything, but
                    I'm pretty sure the only one around
                    here who might want to kill you is
                    me.
          
          Cass SEES A DARK CHEVY in the rearview mirror, gets a look at
          the driver and goes pale.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh no.
          
                              MILO
                    What?
          
                              CASS
                    Behind us. It's him. The guy I saw
                    back at the casino.
          
          Milo glances into the mirror, checking the guy out.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah? He doesn't look like a cop to
                    me.
          
                              CASS

                    NO!!
          
          Cass kicks a leg over and SLAMS HER FOOT ONTO THE GAS. The

          Milo tries to push her foot off the gas while they wrestle
          for the wheel. THE CAR DOES A CRAZY ZIG-ZAG BACK AND FORTH...

          CLOSE ON- THE CADILLAC'S REAR TIRE, AS IT GOES FLAT FROM A
          BULLET...
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          MILO GRIPS THE WHEEL AS THE CAR STARTS TO DRAG AND LOSE
          GROUND. Cass is hunched over in the passenger seat, excited
          and frightened at the same time.
          
          Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel
          to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR.
          Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and
          FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The cadillac SPEEDS away, leaving Mahler's car behind.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EARLY EVENING
          
          The Cadillac is parked on the shoulder, Milo changing the
          tire, Cass standing by the passenger door, still handcuffed,
          EXCITED:
          
                                                                  58.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I told you they were trying to kill
                    me!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, no one's killing you
                    until I get you to jail.
          
          Cass whips her head around to look at him:
          
                              CASS
                    You're still taking me to jail? But
                    it's the cops who are after me.
          
                              MILO
                    First of all: that guy was not a
                    cop. Second of all, we just left
                    him unconscious in a ditch. You'll
                    be fine.
          
                              CASS
                    But...this is important! This is my
                    job!
          
                               MILO
                    And this...(pointing between them)
                    is my job.
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, you don't understand what's
                    going on!
          
          Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.
          
                              MILO
                    I'll lay it out for you: some loser
                    with a minor sheet calls you up and
                    says, hey, I've got a big story for
                    you, you interested? It'll only
                    cost you a couple hundred bucks,
                    and I'll tip you onto some criminal
                    activity, it's your chance to
                    expose some bad guys and write the
                    story of your life. Then the moron
                    gets himself caught, he's probably
                    in cold storage somewhere, and now
                    you think the bad guys are after
                    you. (beat) See? I get it. I just
                    don't care.
          
          Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and
          heads back around to the driver's seat.
          
                                                                 59.
          
          
          Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into
          her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.
          
                               CASS
                         (CASUALLY)
                    If only I knew exactly when and
                    where this deal was going down.
                    Course, if I can't figure out that
                    part, then you definitely can't
                    figure out that part, because we
                    both know I'm much smarter than
                    you.
          
          Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. My brain can dance circles
                    around your brain.
          
                              CASS
                    I don't even know what that means.
          
                              MILO
                    Case closed.
          
                              CASS
                        (SHRUGGING)
                    Fine. Guess we'll never know.
          
          Milo hesitates. Then decides: fuck it. He strides around the
          car and SNATCHES the paper from her hand. He reads:
          
                              MILO
                    "Atlantic City. Xmas Eve. Sparrow."
                    What's "Sparrow"?
          
                              CASS
                    I knew you couldn't figure it out.
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    It's a business.
          
                                CASS
                    No.
          
                                MILO
                    Casino.
          
                                CASS
                    Nope.
          
                                MILO
                    Stripper?
          
                                                                 60.
          
          
                              CASS
                    I don't think so. What kind of
                    strip bars have you been going to,
                    anyway?
          
          Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs
          loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, well, forget it, I knew you
                    couldn't do it.
          
                              MILO
                    Please. I could crack that story
                    and still get you to jail on time.
          
                                 CASS
                    Oh yeah?
          
          Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:
          
                                 CASS
                    Wanna bet?
          
          Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face
          is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He
          thrusts out his hand:
          
                                 MILO
                    You're on.
          
          They shake.
          
                              MILO
                    I have to make a call.
          
          He starts to walk away.
          
                              CASS
                    Hey. Aren't you going to uncuff me?
          
                              MILO
                    Why? You going somewhere?
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...no.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you don't need to be uncuffed.
          
                                                                  61.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass sits in the passenger seat and watches in the rearview
          mirror while Milo paces behind the car, on the phone.
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    Asshole.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is talking to Sid:
          
                              MILO
                    So there's just gonna be a little
                    delay...
          
          SPLIT-SCREEN:
          
          INT MALL- EARLY EVENING
          
          Sid's at the mall. On Dec 23rd. With all the other desperate,
          last-minute shoppers. In other words, HE'S IN HELL.
          
                              SID
                    I don't get it. Why are you helping
                    her?
          
                              MILO
                    But that's the beauty of it, Sid,
                    I'm not helping her, she only
                    thinks I'm helping her.
          
                              SID
                    Yeah? If you're not helping her,
                    what are you doing?
          
          Milo notices Cass watching him and turns his back slightly.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Cass narrows her eyes:
          
                              CASS
                        (to herself)
                    What is he up to?
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          Milo is making this up as he goes along:
          
                                                                  62.
          
          
                              MILO
                    I'll tell you what I'm doing: I'm
                    gonna crack this case first, and
                    I'm gonna take all the credit. Who
                    knows, maybe I'll even get my job
                    back....
          
                              SID
                    You are so full of shit. You don't
                    want your job back. You just want
                    to prove you're smarter than she
                    is.
          
                              MILO
                        (instantly heated)
                    I am smarter than she is. I would
                    have cracked that 13th Street case
                    way before she did if she hadn't...
          
                              SID
                    ...cheated, right, I know, you've
                    told me a million times. Did it
                    ever occur to you that a normal
                    couple wouldn't compete the way you
                    guys do in the first place?
          
          Sid spots what he is looking for. So does another last-minute
          shopper. They both reach for the toy.
          
                              MILO
                    This from the man currently trying
                    to prove to his wife he can handle
                    Xmas.
          
                              SID
                        (instantly heated)
                    I can handle Xmas!
          
          Sid WRENCHES the toy from the other shopper.
          
                              MILO
                    Just..trust me, Ok?
          
                              SID
                    Do I have a choice?
          
                              MILO
                    Nope.
          
          Milo hangs up and gets in the car.
          
                                                                 63.
          
          
          EXT CADILLAC- EARLY EVENING
          
          The cadillac pulls a U-turn and HEADS BACK TOWARDS ATLANTIC
          CITY.
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 39 HOURS TO GO."
          
                              MILO (O.S.)
                    So. Atlantic City. Xmas Eve...
          
          
          EXT HOTDOG STAND- EVENING
          
          Milo buys a chili dog while talking to Cass who stands next
          to him, handcuffed.
          
                              MILO
                    ...so what exactly are these dirty
                    cops supposed to be doing?
          
                              CASS
                    Stealing evidence from property
                    rooms. Then destroying it, for the
                    right price.
          
          Milo stares.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    Nothing. It's just...it's a good
                    idea. If it weren't, you know.
                    Wrong. (continuing) So. Your plan
                    is to catch them red-handed before
                    they can destroy the evidence, then
                    write an expose for the paper and
                    win yourself another big award.
          
                              CASS
                    Something like that.

                    Only, you don't know what Sparrow
                    is. (thinking) Could be a nickname.
                    Or the place where the evidence is
                    stashed. Or a code word of some
                    kind. But the guy who knows has
                    gone missing, and you think the
                    dirty cops got a hold of him.
          
                                                                  64.

                    When Jimmy called earlier, someone
                    else was there. And they
                    disconnected the call.
          
          Milo is staring at her.
          
                              MILO
                    So we find your source, we find the
                    dirty cops. Gimme your phone.
          
          She hands it to him. Milo checks the record of incoming calls
          and smiles.
          
                                CASS
                    What?

          Bobby talks into his cell phone while supervising a parade of
          hookers being loaded into a van:

                    Here's one: why did the snowman
                    pull down his pants? Cause he heard
                    the snowblower was coming!

                    Funny. Listen, Bob, I need a favor.

                    Anything.

                    I need an address to go with a
                    phone number. But I need it ASAP.
                    Kinda got a guy on my tail...
          
          
          EXT GARAGE- EVENING
          
          A tow truck is pulling up, towing Mahler's car. The tow truck
          driver turns to Mahler, who is in the passenger seat:
          
                              TOW TRUCK DRIVER
                    The garage is closed for the night.
                    Guess you'll have to wait til
                    tomorrow.
          
                                                                 65.
          
          
          Mahler thinks this over, then SMACKS THE DRIVER ACROSS THE
          FACE WITH THE BUTT OF HIS GUN. The driver crumples in his
          seat.
          
                                 MAHLER
                    Guess not.
          
          Mahler leans across him, opens the driver's side door, and
          BOOTS him out of the cab.
          
          
          EXT HIGHWAY- EVENING
          
          The tow truck is driving away from the garage.
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo climbs back into the car, holding a piece of paper with
          the words "Trump Casino, room 2504" on it. He grins at Cass.
          
                              CASS
                    Pretty proud of yourself, ey?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You're a reporter. Great. But
                    I used to be a cop. Let's face it:
                    I'm naturally gonna be one step
                    ahead of you.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    You weren't last time.
          
          Milo whips his head around:
          
                              MILO
                    What did you say?
          
                              CASS
                    I said you're doing a great job.

          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo pulls into the crowded parking lot and checks the
          cartridge of his gun. Beside him, Cass is bubbling over with
          excited energy:
          
                                                                  66.
          
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, here's what I think we should
                    do: I'll go up first, Jimmy knows
                    me, so if anything's wrong I'm sure
                    he'll give me a sign...
          
                              MILO
                    Excellent plan. Oh, except you're
                    staying in the car.
          
          Milo exits the car.
          
                              CASS
                        (shouting after him)
                    But...it's my story!
          
          But he is already headed for the casino entrance. He waves at
          her and disappears inside.
          
                                CASS

          INT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of
          the slot machines, headed for the elevators. A DRUNK GUY in a
          Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO
          COLLIDE...
          
                              MILO
                        (steadying the guy)
                    You Ok? My bad.
          
                              DRUNK GUY
                    Watch where you're going. (under
                    his breath) Prick.
          
          The drunk guy continues past. Milo holds up THE ROOM CARD KEY
          HE HAS JUST SWIPED FROM THE GUY:
          
                              MILO
                        (calling after him)
                    Merry Xmas to you, too!
          
          
          INT TRUMP CASINO 25TH FLOOR- EVENING
          
          The elevator dings and Milo exits. He turns a corner and
          heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.
          
          Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks
          behind him. No one is there.
          
                                                                    67.
          
          
          He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT
          DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY
          ON 2505.
          
                              MILO
                    Room service.
          
          No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight
          movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the
          door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE
          MACHINE ROOM...
          
          
          INT ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the
          door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM
          AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand
          across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And
          finds himself face to face with:
          
          CASS.
          
                              MILO
                    What the...?
          
          He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL
          ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.
          
                              MILO
                        (loud whisper)
                    What the hell are you doing?
          
                               CASS
                        (SAME)
                    It's my story, I don't break
                    stories by staying in the car!
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, (re: the armrest)
                    you're paying for that.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.
          
          Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as
          someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass'
          lips.
          
          Then he peeks out the door.
          
          MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE
          HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.
          
                                                                  68.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Perfect. (to Cass) Play along.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD
          SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE
          SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.
          
                               MILO
                        (LOUD)
                    Godammit. Son of a bitch.
          
          The maid peeks out into the hall.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    This is like the third card they've
                    given me...
          
                              CASS
                        (playing along)
                    Take it easy, honey...
          
                              MILO
                    Don't tell me to take it easy, now
                    we have to go all the way
                    downstairs again...
          
          Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.
          
                              MAID
                    What's the name?
          
                              MILO
                    Davenport. Room 2505.
          
          The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER
          PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
          
                              MILO
                    You're an angel.
          
          Milo and Cass go inside.
          
          
          INT ROOM 2505- EVENING
          
          Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes
          across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his
          heels. All is silent.
          
                                                                    69.

                        (WHISPERING)
                    Wait a second: where's my gun?
          
                               MILO
                        (SAME)
                    I don't know. Where is your gun?
          
                              CASS
                    I don't have one.
          
                              MILO
                    Then you've answered your own
                    question.
          
          Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.
          
                              CASS
                    Come on, give me something. You've
                    got, like, a million weapons in the
                    jacket.
          
          She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. These are not toys. You can't
                    just give them to someone and have
                    them know how to use them.
          
                              CASS
                    I seem to remember doing just fine
                    with your taser gun.
          
          They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and
          tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when
          THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.
          
          No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN
          KICKS THE DOOR IN...
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING
          KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the
          elevators...
          
          
          INT ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS
          COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room.
          The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom
          and peers in: EMPTY.
          
                                                                 70.
          
          
          Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees
          spots on the rug:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh, god, is that blood?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm just trying to...
          
                              MILO
                    This could be a crime scene. There
                    are clues all over this room that
                    only a trained eye can find. And as
                    I seem to recall, you were the one
                    who was unable to figure this out
                    by herself.
          
          Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                        (under her breath)
                    He is unbelievable.
          
                              MILO
                    Who are you talking to, your
                    imaginary friend Leslie?
          
                              CASS
                        (BLUSHING)
                    Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary
                    friends, despite what my mother
                    believes.
          
                              MILO
                    Whatever. You wait by the door. And
                    I'll handle this.
          
                              CASS
                        (PISSED)
                    Fine.
          
          She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a
          matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK
          SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.
          
                              CASS
                    So you're saying you don't want my
                    help.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm saying I don't need your help.
          
                                                                 71.
          
          
                                CASS
                          (SHRUGGING)
                    Ok.
          
          As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE.
          Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and
          glances back:
          
                              MILO
                    What was that?
          
                              CASS
                        (INNOCENTLY)
                    What was what?
          
                              MILO
                    Did you find something?
          
                              CASS
                    How could I find anything? I'm not
                    the detective.
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme see your purse...
          
          Milo takes a step closer to her, but:
          
                                VOICE
                    FREEZE!
          
          Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE
          DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his
          eyes.
          
                              GUARD
                    Hotel security! Stay where you are!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably
                    gonna want this.
          
          Milo holds up HIS GUN.
          
                              GUARD
                        (PANICKED)
                    DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!
          
                              MILO
                    Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload
                    it.
          
          Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE
          GUARD'S FACE.
          
                                                                   72.
          
          
          The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES
          him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the
          table.
          
          Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.
          
          
          INT HALLWAY- EVENING
          
          Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING:
          BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls
          Cass into the stairwell...
          
          
          INT STAIRWELL- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS
          IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS
          COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell
          window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.
          
                              MILO
                    You're gonna have to jump.
          
                                 CASS
                    I can't.
          
          Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE
          WINDOW.
          
          
          EXT TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall
          and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO
          THE GROUND.
          
          Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.
          
                              BOBBY (O.S.)
                    Ok, so some guy you're looking for
                    has disappeared. You want me to put
                    out an all-points on him?
          
          
          INT CADILLAC- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass are speeding away from the Trump Casino.
          
                              MILO
                        (into phone)
                    The thing is, Bob: Cass thinks
                    dirty cops might be involved.
          
                                                                 73.

          INT POLICE STATION- EVENING
          
          Bobby is in his office. His door opens onto the squad room,
          busy with police activity. Bobby sits up straighter in his
          chair.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with
                    Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when
                    you're around her your brain turns
                    to mush.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah, well, that doesn't change the
                    fact that someone took a couple
                    shots at us.
          
          Beat.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You get a plate number?
          
                              MILO
                    Happened too quick. But it was a
                    dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey,
                    New Jersey plates, and the car was
                    wrecked, I know that.
          
          Bobby thinks this over.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I
                    can find. Just hold tight, Ok?
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. But we're kinda on a clock
                    here.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Milo, don't fuck around with this.
                    If there are dirty cops in the
                    house, we all have a problem. So do
                    me a favor: get off the strip, find
                    somewhere to lie low and wait for
                    my call.
          
                                                                   74.
          
          
          EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
          
          The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and
          RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly,
          dangerous Odd Couple.
          
          An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO
          FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT.
          Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Yeah, that's him.
          
                              RAY
                    Who's the chick?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they
                    can't be far.
          
          It's true. They aren't too far. They are:
          
          
          EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING
          
          A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees,
          "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door.
          
          CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."
          
          The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic...
          
                              CASS (O.S.)
                    Ok. Kill me now.
          
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL
          THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The
          place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.
          
                              MILO
                    I'm sorry, it's the only place I
                    know off the strip.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not going in. What if they
                    remember us?
          
                              MILO
                    They won't remember us. Why would
                    they remember us? Just...try to act
                    normal.

          She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all
          the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A

          A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and

                    what, 3 years?
          
          Milo and Cass both try to downplay:
          
                                 MILO
                    Has it?

          Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.
          
                              MILO

                    So. Use a credit card.
          
                              MILO
                    Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours.
          
                              CASS
                    Mine's max'd too. (off his look)
                    What, I like to shop.
          
          They give each other a horrified look as they both realize
          what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their
          arms around each other, and smile:
          
                              MILO/CASS
                    It's our third anniversary!

                    Thanks!
          
          Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her
          ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.

          Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay
          couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by
          the fire.
          
          And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled,
          being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile
          uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:
          
                              EDMUND
                    To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
          
          He gives them both a broad wink.
          
                                 MILO
                           (GRIMLY)
                    Wow.
          
                                 CASS
                        (SAME)
                    Great.
          
                              EDMUND
                    So tell me: how have you managed to
                    keep the romance alive all this
                    time?
          
                              MILO
                    Well, I'll tell you, Edmund.
                    The secret to our success is that
                    the little woman here knows her
                    place. She cleans for me, cooks for
                    me, and every night when I come
                    home she gets down on her knees and
                    massages my feet.
          
          He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.
          
                              CASS
                    Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage
                    his feet to help him feel like a
                    man. It's important, especially
                    when your husband has such a teeny
                    tiny...
          
          Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:
          
                                                                 78.

                    How is everything? Is it like that
                    magical night 3 years ago?
          
                              CASS
                    Uh-huh.
          
                              MILO
                    Yup. You betcha.
          
                              DAWN
                    This calls for a toast!
          
          She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass
          both groan under their breath.
          
                              DAWN
                        (to the room)
                    May I have your attention please?
                    Edmund and I would like to share
                    with you the most romantic moment
                    we have ever seen. It was three
                    years ago today, in this very
                    restaurant, when this lovely young
                    man here, right in the middle of
                    the meal, threw down his napkin,
                    got down on one knee, and said
                    marry me, right now, right this
                    second, I want to go to sleep
                    tonight knowing you're my wife!
          
                              EDMUND
                        (jumping in)
                    And she said yes, with tears in her
                    eyes and a tremble in her hand,
                    let's get married, and they ran out
                    to the all night chapel and came
                    back an hour later, man and wife!
          
          The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:
          
                              MILO
                    Can I get a whiskey?
          
                              CASS
                    Make that two.

          Milo and Cass stumble down the hall, laughing hysterically,
          falling down drunk.
          
                                                                  79.
          
          
                              MILO
                    After we broke up, I was so mad at
                    you, I told everyone I know you
                    have herpes.
          
                               CASS
                    I told everyone you flunked out of
                    3rd grade.
          
                               MILO
                    I told everyone you have a
                    moustache.
          
                              CASS
                    I told everyone you like to wear my
                    panties.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey!
          
          This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT
          
          Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new
          surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A
          fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.
          
          The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:
          
                              CASS
                    Wow. This would be really awkward
                    if we still had feelings for each
                    other. Which we don't...
          
                              MILO
                    That's right. Luckily, we're
                    different people now. We don't feel
                    the way we used to.
          
                              CASS
                    Right. We've moved on.
          
                              MILO
                    We have no feelings about each
                    other whatsoever.
          
                              MILO
                    Just two people who used to know

                       Feels good, doesn't it?
          
                                 CASS
                       Feels fantastic.
          
                                 MILO
                       A platonic relationship. Working
                       together.
          
                                 CASS

                                 MILO
                       Trusting each other.
          
          Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward
          pause. Then:
          
                                 CASS
                       Well. Mind if I shower?
          
                                 MILO
                       Ladies first.
          
          Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind
          her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS.

          As soon as Milo hears the water, HE HURRIES OVER TO THE BED

                    I want grandkids!
          
          Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone.
          Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She
          looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.
          
          A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She
          slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing
          back her hair with her hands.
          
          Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and
          two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?
          
                                                                    83.
          
          
          They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks
          out the bathroom door and sees...

          Milo hears the water go off. HE POCKETS THE MATCHES, tosses
          the purse away and lies on the bed, striking a casual pose.
          
          Cass emerges.
          
                              MILO
                    Good shower?

                    The best.

                    You know what's great? Trusting
                    each other.
          
                                MILO
                    I agree.
          
          He holds up the handcuffs:

          SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM
          TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND
          CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.
          
          Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and
          glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND
          GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...
          
          
          INT LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER
          
          Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S
          BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up.
          She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee
          over him, when he stirs.
          
          She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing
          Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out,
          HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
          
          She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched,
          THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:
          
                                 MILO
                    Excuse me.
          
          Cass FREEZES.
          
                              MILO
                    What are you doing?
          
          She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This
          is going to be a tough one to explain.
          
                                 CASS
                    Um...
          
                              MILO
                    Are you trying to seduce me?

                    Yes. Yes I am.
          
          She tries to reach for the gun while they talk.

                    I didn't know you were still so
                    attracted to me. I mean, I remember
                    how you used to like to greet me at

                    Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted
                    to you.
          
          Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She
          stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.
          
                               MILO
                    Really? Wow. That's great news. You
                    know what would be really sexy

                    No. If you talked dirty to me.
          
          The gun seems to be getting father away. THEIR LIPS ARE

                    Um...I can't stop thinking about
                    you.

                              MILO
                    Be specific.
          
          Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...
          
                              MILO

          THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE
          KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him
          and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.

                    get to come out on top! Karma,

                    Oh my god, would you get over it
                    already! So I cracked the case
                    before you did, it was 3 years ago,
                    it happened, stop being such a baby
                    and move on!

                    Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm
                    moving on? By cracking this case
                    before you, then taking you in so
                    you can spend this Xmas in jail,
                    all alone.
          
          He rolls over, turning his back to her. Cass stares at the
          ceiling, fuming.

                    Nothing. I had her add mayo to your
                    burger. I remember you like that.
          
          Milo glances at Dawn and she nods in confirmation.

          Milo takes a bite from his burger and considers Cass.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, look: I know you're probably
                    upset that you're not gonna get the
                    story. But a person can't win every

                    referring to is you, I agree: you
                    can't win every time.

          SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly
          reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing
          herself.

          Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An
          EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest,
          then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.
          
                                                                  91.

                    Relax. That was an adrenaline shot.
          
                              MILO
                    I don't believe it. She tried to
                    kill me.
          
          The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then
          helps Milo off the stretcher.
          
                              EMT
                    No one tried to kill you, buddy.
                    You just need to be more careful
                    about what you eat.

          He checks his watch, then pulls out the GREEN MATCHBOOK:

                    Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk.
                    And just FYI: when they say "don't
                    touch" the dancers, they mean with
                    with any part of your body, not
                    just your hands.
          
          The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and
          THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

          takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the

          METS' HAT ON THE GROUND.
          
          Shit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She
          presses her ear up against the back door:

          Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting.
          LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks
          around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a
          trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of
          it, and cautiously climbs up.
          
          The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck
          it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.
          
          She wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS

          The top of a head appears, then a face: IT'S CASS.
          
          Relieved, Jimmy starts gesturing excitedly for her to come
          in. Cass climbs in, drops to the floor, hurries over to Jimmy
          and ungags him.

                    don't blame ya. I want to hurt her
                    all the time.
          
          Cass grabs the phone from Dwight. Into phone:
          
                              CASS
                    Milo, listen, they're not kidding,
                    Ok?

          Milo slips inside and scans the room. HE SEES CASS IN A BOOTH
          ACROSS THE ROOM WITH DWIGHT AND RAY. Into phone:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Fine. Say you were wrong.
          
          Cass hesitates. Into phone:
          
                                CASS
                    For what?
          
                              MILO
                    For what? For poisoning me with
                    sesame and almost killing me!
          
          Beat.

                              CASS
                    Ok. Maybe that was not the best...
          
                              MILO
                    Say you were wrong.

                    I could have found a more mature...

                              CASS
                    I was possibly out of line...

                    Say you were wrong.

                    Ok, ok, I was wrong!
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Now. Admit that the only reason
                    you were able to crack that case
                    three years ago was because you
                    looked through my files.
          
          Long pause.
          
                                CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    I think I'll hang up now...

                    Ok, Ok. I looked through your
                    files. Are you happy?
          
                              MILO
                    Thrilled. Now tell them I'll be
                    there in 20 minutes. Meanwhile,
                    stop shifting in your seat like
                    that and just tell them you have to
                    use the bathroom.
          
          Cass sits up straighter. Wait a second, he's here?
          
                              MILO
                    Don't look around. Just do it.
          
          CLICK. He hangs up.
          
                                                                    97.

                    You boys mind if I use the ladies
                    room?
          
          
          INT BATHROOM- MOMENTS LATER
          
          Cass enters. Milo is behind the door. He SLAMS the door
          closed after she is in, and blocks her escape.
          
                              MILO
                    You know what my mistake was? I
                    never should have let you out of
                    the trunk. I'm fine, by the way.
                    The doctor said I may have been
                    technically dead for a few seconds,
                    but I'm fine now.
          
          Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.
          
                              CASS
                    So that's what you really think?
                    That I stole information from you?
          
                              MILO
                    It's not what I think, it's what I
                    know. How else did you beat me?
          
                              CASS
                        (as though to a 5 yr old)
                    Did it ever occur to you that I
                    just might be good at my job?
          
          Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...
          
                              CASS
                    That's what I thought. You know
                    what, Milo? You're an even bigger
                    asshole than I previously
                    suspected, and you deserve
                    everything that's happened to you.
                    (beat) And everything that's about
                    to happen to you.
          
          "About to happen"? Milo is just starting to realize...
          
                              MILO
                    You wouldn't...
          
                              CASS
                        (SCREAMING)
                    MILO BOYD IS IN HERE!
          
                                                                  98.
          
          
          Son of a bitch. The bathroom door SHOOTS open and DWIGHT AND
          RAY ENTER. They back Milo into a corner. Cass smiles at Milo,
          waves, and exits.
          
          
          EXT CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON
          
          Cass comes flying out of the club and runs right into:
          MAHLER. HE TAKES ONE LOOKS AT HER AND PUSHES HER BACK INSIDE.
          
          
          INT BATHROOM- AFTERNOON
          
          Dwight and Ray are frisking Milo, taking away his array of
          weapons.
          
                              DWIGHT
                    Wow. You always carry this much
                    gear?
          
                              MILO
                    Only during the holidays.
          
          
          INT CHARLEY'S- CONTINUOUS
          
          Milo is pushed out of the bathroom, and comes face to face
          with CASS. MAHLER APPEARS FROM BEHIND HER, TAKES ONE LOOK AT
          MILO AND POINTS HIS GUN AT MILO'S HEAD.
          
                              MAHLER
                    Remember me?
          
                              DWIGHT
                    What the fuck?
          
          Dwight steps forward from behind Milo, AND POINTS HIS GUN AT
          MAHLER. MAHLER REACTS, SHIFTING THE GUN TO DWIGHT. RAY STEPS
          UP, GUN POINTED AT MAHLER.
          
          Momentary stand-off. Stuck between the bad guys, MILO AND
          CASS GIVE EACH OTHER EVIL LOOKS.
          
          A half-naked dancer appears:
          
                                DANCER
                    Lapdance?
          
          Everyone looks at her. She is just realizing...
          
                              DANCER
                    Maybe I should come back later...

          ...WHEN MILO AND CASS SIMULTANEOUSLY MAKE THEIR MOVES, CASS
          STOMPING ON MAHLER'S FOOT, CAUSING HIM TO LOOSEN HIS HOLD ON
          HER, MILO SLAMMING HIS ELBOW BACK ONTO RAY'S ABDOMEN.
          
          RAY'S GUN GOES OFF AS CASS AND MILO BOTH HIT THE FLOOR.
          MAHLER REACTS, FIRING AT RAY. DWIGHT FIRES AT MAHLER...
          
          TOTAL PANDEMONIUM. Girls screaming, patrons running for the
          exit.
          
          MAHLER AND DWIGHT BOTH GET HIT. Milo crawls over to a moaning
          Dwight and recovers his gun. He looks up in time to see CASS
          DISAPPEARING OUT THE FRONT DOOR.
          
          
          EXT BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON
          
          Milo comes out. THE BOARDWALK IS PACKED, CASS IS LOST IN THE
          CROWD. Milo raises his gun in the air and FIRES. People duck
          and scatter REVEALING CASS, climbing into the Cadillac.
          
          SIRENS...

          Cass jumps into the car and hits the gas. She is pulling
          away, victorious, WHEN THERE IS A SOUND ON THE ROOF.
          
          MILO'S FACE APPEARS, UPSIDE-DOWN, IN THE WINDSHIELD,
          GRINNING.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, Milo.
          
          He gives her the finger.
          
                                CASS
                      Get off the car, you psychopath.
          
                                MILO
                      Oh, I am a psychopath, and you know
                      why? Cause you made me that way.
                      And if I'm going crazy, I'm taking
                      you with me.
          
          He reaches a hand through the driver's window, grabbing at
          her. Cass SCREAMS, squeezes her eyes shut and HITS THE GAS.
          
          MORE SIRENS, RAPIDLY APPROACHING...
          
                                                                    100.

          Milo falls into the car, grabbing at the wheel. They fight
          for control of the car as it goes spinning off the road...

          Cass and Milo both just sit there breathing for a moment.
          Then Milo turns and glares at Cass, and THE LOOK ON HER FACE
          SAYS SHE KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING NEXT:

          reluctantly answers:

          Milo looks around. He can just make out Pier 19 in the

                       Yeah.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass drive up in the Cadillac and park out of sight.
          They exit the car and look around. The pier seems to be
          deserted. Then they hear a soft motor, and BOBBY APPEARS IN A
          MOTORBOAT.
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Get in.
          
          
          EXT OCEAN- EARLY EVENING
          
          The sound of a motorboat chugging along.
          
          
          INT MOTORBOAT- EVENING
          
          Bobby is at the back of the boat, steering. Cass and Milo are
          up front, explaining:
          
                                 CASS
                       So, these guys have a bunch of
                       stolen evidence stashed somewhere
                       in Atlantic City...
          
                                 MILO
                       And we think they're ditching it
                       tonight.
          
          A SMALL YACHT APPEARS ON THE HORIZON. Bobby steers the
          motorboat towards it. MILO AND CASS TURN TO LOOK AS THE YACHT
          COMES INTO VIEW. AND AT THE SAME MOMENT, CASS AND MILO MAKE
          OUT THE NAME ON THE SIDE OF THE BOAT:
          
          "SPARROW".
          
                                 BOBBY
                           (CASUALLY)
                       You know, if I was them, I'd store
                       the evidence on a boat, drive the
                       boat about 30 miles out, and blow
                       the whole thing up.
          
          Cass and Milo both slowly turn to find BOBBY POINTING A GUN
          AT THE TWO OF THEM. Off Milo's disappointed look:
          
                                 BOBBY
                       Hey, man. I got mouths to feed.
          
                                                                 103.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Aw. That's what all the dirty cops
                    say.
          
          Bobby quickly frisks Cass, and frisks and disarms Milo. He
          steers the boat one-handed up next to the yacht and cuts the
          motorboats engine.
          
          Milo makes a sudden LUNGE for Bobby and BOBBY CRACKS HIM OVER
          THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE BUTT OF THE GUN, SENDING MILO
          SPRAWLING TO THE BACK OF THE BOAT, RIGHT ON TOP OF THE MOTOR.
          
          Milo struggles back up to a seated position.
          
                              BOBBY
                    You've always been such a stubborn
                    asshole, Milo. You just don't
                    listen. All you had to do was stay
                    where I told you and none of this
                    would have happen. Now the two of
                    you are gonna have to go down with
                    the boat.
          
          
          INT HULL OF YACHT- EVENING
          
          CHIRON: "11:00 PM. ATLANTIC OCEAN. 10 HOURS TO GO".
          
          PAN PAST PILES OF EVIDENCE BOXES FULL OF EVERYTHING
          IMAGINABLE: GUNS, VIDEOTAPES, DRUGS, ETC...
          
          PAN PAST A PILE OF EXPLOSIVES WRAPPED WITH CABLE AND ATTACHED
          TO A TIMER, COUNTING DOWN: "1:59, 1:58, 1:57..."
          
          PAN TO MILO AND CASS SEATED ON THE FLOOR, TIED TOGETHER, BACK
          TO BACK, ARMS STRAPPED TO THEIR SIDES.
          
          PAN TO THE DOORWAY, where Bobby stands, inspecting the room.
          
                              BOBBY
                    Ok. Guess that's it. Gotta go.
                    (checking them out) You know what?
                    You guys make a great couple.
          
          Bobby exits and Cass and Milo are alone.
          
          Suddenly, CASS STARTS GIGGLING.
          
                              MILO
                    What's so funny?
          
                              CASS
                    My mom was worried I wouldn't have
                    plans for Xmas Eve.
          
                                                                    104.
          
          
          Cass is laughing harder and harder until MILO REALIZES:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, are you crying?
          
                              CASS
                        (SOBBING)
                    No. I'm not...
          
          Milo doesn't know what to do. His hands are trapped in front
          of him, he can't even pat her on the shoulder.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, just don't...
          
                              CASS
                    I'm not crying.
          
                              MILO
                    I know you're not.
          
                              CASS
                    I just...(miserable) I can't
                    believe I going to die by being
                    blown up and sinking to the bottom
                    of the ocean with someone who
                    thinks I'm a total liar.
          
                              MILO
                    We're not gonna die.
          
                              CASS
                    Oh yeah? What's the plan?
          
                              MILO
                        (THINKING)
                    Well...
          
          Milo looks around. There is a SMALL PORTHOLE IN ONE WALL.
          Milo assumes a take-charge manner:
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. Here's what we do. We're going
                    to synchronize our efforts in order
                    to cross the room and manipulate
                    the bomb out of the room and into
                    the water in order to diffuse the
                    explosive impact.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    You mean we're going to throw the
                    bomb out the window?
          
                                                                105.
          
          
                              MILO
                    Uh, yeah. Or we can just wait to
                    get blown up.
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER: "1:19, 1:18, 1:17..."
          
                              CASS
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I'm with you. Go, team, go.
          
                              MILO
                    That's the spirit. Ok, first we're
                    going sideways: to the left...
          
          Milo leans one way, Cass leans the other: THEY DON'T MOVE.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok. My left this time...
          
          They both lean to the left and topple over. Milo is facing
          the direction of the bomb.
          
                              MILO
                    Now we're gonna work our way over
                    to the bomb.
          
          They start moving like a sideways inchworm, creeping along.
          
                              MILO
                    And I don't think you're a total
                    liar, but in my own defense, I was
                    one of the top detectives in my
                    division, I had been working that
                    case for months, and then you just
                    waltzed in and solved it.
          
                              CASS
                    I didn't just "waltz in". You know
                    I had been working it for months,
                    too. Isn't it possible that we're
                    both good at our jobs, and I just
                    happened to come out ahead?
          
          Beat.
          
                              MILO
                        (FUMBLING)
                    Oh. Well, I...(blurting out) Look,
                    I was confused, I had never been in
                    love before!
          
                              CASS
                    Well, neither had I!
          
                                                                    106.
          
          
          Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond,
          THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS'
          DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                                CASS
                    Ow...
          
                                MILO
                    Shit..
          
                                CASS
                    Dammit...
          
          They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF
          THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.
          
                                CASS
                    Milo?
          
                              MILO
                        (MUFFLED)
                    I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the
                    right, and wait for the next wave.
          
          They both start turning separate ways:
          
                                MILO
                    My right.
          
          They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    So. You were in love with me?
          
                              CASS
                    Of course I was in love with you,
                    why do you think I married you?
          
          No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass
          REALIZES:
          
                              CASS
                    Oh. My. God. You think I married
                    you so I could get info on the
                    case? Who am I, Mata Hari?
          
          Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...
          
                              CASS
                    She's a spy, Milo.
          
          Aaah.
          
                                                                 107.
          
          
                              MILO
                        (QUICKLY)
                    I know that. Everybody knows that.
                    Mata Hari the spy.
          
          Beat. Milo clears his throat.
          
                              MILO
                    Well. It might be a little late for
                    this. But...nice job on the
                    article.
          
                              CASS
                    You know, if I had something sharp
                    right now, I would stab you.
          
                              MILO
                    No, really, I mean, it was well-
                    written and...
          
                              CASS
                    Can you just get us out of here,
                    please?
          
          Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS
          THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:
          
                              CASS
                    Umph...
          
                              MILO
                    Ughh...
          
                              CASS
                    Son of a...
          
                              MILO
                    Ow...
          
          And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE
          BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."
          
                              CASS
                    Can you see the bomb?
          
                               MILO
                    Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now
                    we get up.
          
          MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and
          Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing
          position.
          
          Great. So far, so good.
          
                                                                 108.
          
          
          Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET
          ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?
          
                              CASS
                    Did you throw it?
          
                              MILO
                    Not exactly.
          
                              CASS
                    Well, what are you waiting for?
          
                              MILO
                    I'm waiting for a pig to fly in
                    here and grab it.
          
                              CASS
                        (starting to panic again)
                    Milo...
          
                              MILO
                    Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to
                    jump.
          
          Beat.
          
                              CASS
                    What?
          
                              MILO
                    You know: "jump, jump, jump around,
                    jump."
          
                              CASS
                    Are you serious?
          
                              MILO
                    No. I'm fucking with you. For fun.
                    Just for my own personal
                    enjoyment...
          
                              CASS
                    Ok, Ok.
          
                              MILO
                    Ok: 1, 2, 3...
          
          
          EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING
          
          We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR.

          MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..."
          
          This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS...
          
          CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."
          
          And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB
          OUT THE WINDOW...
          
          CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER...
          
          
          INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING
          
          Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still,
          listening. Silence.
          
                              CASS
                    Think the water defused it?
          
                              MILO
                    Lemme ask you this? Has anything
                    gone our way yet?
          
          SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH
          THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.
          
          Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.
          
                                CASS
                    Nice job.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. You, too.
          
                                CASS
                    Thanks.
          
                              MILO
                    Now lets find something to cut
                    these ropes off...
          
                              CASS
                    Think we can catch that cop?
          
                              MILO
                    Trust me: we can definitely catch
                    that cop.
          
          Because at this very moment...
          
                                                                    110.
          
          
          INT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT
          
          ...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a
          while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO
          START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind
          him, and he paddles faster.
          
          
          EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT
          
          Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the
          motorboat. Calling out:
          
                              MILO
                    Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...
          
          Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE
          GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:
          
                              MILO
                    What's the difference between a
                    snowman and a snowwoman? (holding
                    something up) The spark plug.
          
          Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO
          GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby
          while he kicks the motor and swears.
          
          
          EXT PIER 19- DAWN
          
          CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."
          
          Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench,
          exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN
          EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a
          squad car.
          
          After a moment:
          
                              MILO
                    Merry Xmas. I got you this.
          
          Milo hands Cass some seaweed.
          
                              CASS
                    You shouldn't have.
          
          Milo checks his watch.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I've still got three hours to
                    get you to jail. Looks like I'm
                    gonna win that bet after all.
          
                                                                  111.
          
          
          Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
          
                              MILO
                        (to himself)
                    You have got to be kidding me.
          
          
          EXT BEACH- DAWN
          
          Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the
          sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one
          last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the
          cuffs.
          
                               CASS
                        (muffled, face in the
                         SAND)
                    I'm not going without a fight.
          
                              MILO
                    Yeah. I'm getting that.
          
          He pulls her to her feet.
          
          INT JERSEY CITY POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo leads Cass up to the clerk, both of them looking like a
          mess. He checks his watch:
          
                              MILO
                    9am. See? Easy as pie.(nudging
                    Cass) Go on, say it.
          
                              CASS
                        (to the clerk)
                    I'd like to turn myself in. (can't
                    resist) Though I didn't do anything
                    wrong...
          
                              MILO
                    Stop talking.
          
                              CASS
                    ...and I was unjustly arrested...
          
          To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS
          KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.
          
          Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.
          
                              MILO
                        (to Cass)
                    See ya.

                              CASS
                        (a little disoriented)
                    Oh. Ok.
          
          The clerk leads her into the jail.
          
          
          EXT POLICE STATION- MORNING
          
          Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN,
          THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.
          
                              GELMAN
                    Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty
                    hunter.
          
          Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons.
          DECIDES:
          
                              MILO
                    Ah, what the hell.
          
          He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE
          FACE WITH HIS FIST.

                              CASS
                    Oh my god, what happened?
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. I couldn't let you spend Xmas
                    alone. Besides, I didn't really
                    have any plans other than drinking
                    some cheap whiskey and putting my
                    fist through a wall.
          
                              CASS
                    I'm touched that you would give
                    that up for me.
          
                              MILO
                    Hey. It's the kind of guy I am.

                     Of course I was right. I knew

                     were just stuck together long

                               CASS
                     Well, I doubt you love me more.

1. EXT. SHERMER HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

     During Brian's monologue, we see various views of things
     inside the school including Bender's locker.

                          BRIAN (VO)
               Saturday...March 24, 1984.  Shermer
               High School, Shermer, Illinois.
               60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
               the fact that we had to sacrifice a
               whole Saturday in detention for
               whatever it was that we did wrong,
               what we did was wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make us write this
               essay telling you who we think we
               are, what do you care?  You see us
               as you want to see us...in the
               simplest terms and the most
               convenient definitions.  You see us
               as a brain, an athelete, a basket
               case, a princess and a criminal.
               Correct?  That's the way we saw each
               other at seven o'clock this morning.
               We were brainwashed...

2. INT. CLAIRE'S CAR - DAY

     We see CLAIRE and her FATHER sitting in their car in the
     parking lot.

     Claire is the prom queen and is clearly a snob.

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you can't get me
               out of this...I mean it's so absurd
               I have to be here on a Saturday!
               It's not like I'm a defective or
               anything...

                       CLAIRE'S FATHER
               I'll make it up to you...Honey,
               ditching class to go shopping
               doesn't make you a defective.  Have
               a good day.

     Claire rolls her eyes and gets out of the car and walks
     up the school front steps
                                                  CUT TO:

3. INT. BRIAN'S CAR - DAY

     We are in BRIAN's car.  His MOTHER is there and so is
     his little SISTER.  He is sort of a nerd.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Is this the first time or the last
               time we do this?

                            BRIAN
                    (upset)
               Last...

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well get in there and use the time
               to your advantage...

                            BRIAN
               Mom, we're not supposed to study; we
               just have to sit there and do
               nothing.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well mister you figure out a way to
               study.

                    BRIAN'S LITTLE SISTER
                    (annoyingly)
               Yeah!

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well go!

     Brian gets out of the car and walks towards the school.

4. INT. ANDREW'S CAR - DAY

     We see ANDREW and his FATHER.  Andrew is clearly a jock;
     hes wearing a lettermans jacket with lots of patches on it.

                       ANDREW'S FATHER
               Hey, I screwed around...guys screw
               around, there's nothing wrong with
               that.  Except you got caught, Sport.

                            ANDREW
               Yeah, Mom already reemed me, alright?

                       ANDREW'S FATHER
                    (angry)
               You wanna miss a match?  You wanna
               blow your ride?  Now no school's
               gonna give a scholarship to a
               discipline case.

     Andrew gets out of the car and walks into the school.

5. EXT. SHERMER PARKING LOT - DAY

     We see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing
     sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't
     stop walking.

     The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.

     Bender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps
     ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps
     forward to look in the car's front window and the car
     drives away.
                                                 CUT TO:

6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     There are six tables in two rows of three.
     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in
     and sits at the table behind her.

     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.

     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
     desk and takes a few things in the process.

     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian
     reluctantly gets up and moves.

     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
     feet up.

     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the
     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
     Brian.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.

     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.

     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack
     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with
     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
     job.

                            VERNON
               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want
               to congradulate you for being on
               time...

     Claire raises her hand.

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's
               been a mistake.  I know it's
               detention, but...um...I don't think
               I belong in here...

     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.

                            VERNON
               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have
               exactly eight hours and fifty-four
               minutes to think about why you're
               here.  To ponder the error of your
               ways...

     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
     mouth again.

     Claire looks like she is going to gag.

                            VERNON
               ...and you may not talk.  You will
               not move from these seats.

     He glances up at Bender and points at him.

                            VERNON
               ...and you...

     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.

                            VERNON
               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,
               we're gonna try something a little
               different today.  We are going to
               write an essay--of no less than a
               thousand words--describing to me
               who you think you are.

                            BENDER
               Is this a test?

     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
     of Bender.

                            VERNON
               And when I say essay...I mean essay.
               I do not mean a single word repeated
               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.
               Bender?

     Bender looks up.

                            BENDER
               Crystal...

                            VERNON
               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little
               something about yourself.  Maybe
               you'll even--decide whether or not
               you care to return.

     Brian raises his hand and then stands.

                            BRIAN
               You know, I can answer that right
               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
               'cause...

                            VERNON
               Sit down Johnson...

                            BRIAN
               Thank you sir...

     He sits.

                            VERNON
               My office...

     Vernon points.

                            VERNON
               ...is right across that hall.  Any
               monkey business is ill-advised...

     He looks around at them.

                            VERNON
               ...any questions?

                            BENDER
               Yeah...I got a question.

     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.

                            BENDER
               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his
               wardrobe?

                            VERNON
               I'll give you the answer to that
               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
               Don't mess with the bull young man,
               you'll get the horns.

     Vernon leaves.

                            BENDER
               That man...is a brownie hound...

     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is
     Allison, biting her nails.

     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is
     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.

                            BENDER
               You keep eating your hand and you're
               not gonna be hungry for lunch...

     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.

                            BENDER
               I've seen you before, you know...

     We see Vernon look out from his office.

     We see Brian playing with his pen.

                            BRIAN
                    (quietly to himself)
               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?
               Who are you?

     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
     under his upper lip.

                            BRIAN
               I am a walrus...

     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices
     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
     embarrassed.

     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing
     his jacket.

     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands
     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket
     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still
     staring at him.

                            BRIAN
               It's the shits, huh?

     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
     laugh.

     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He
     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's
     head.

     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
     Bender.

     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
     song.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to herself)
               I can't believe this is really
               happening to me...

     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.

                            BENDER
               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do
               if we hafta take a piss?

                            CLAIRE
                    (disgusted)
               Please...

                            BENDER
               If you gotta go...

     We hear Bender unzip his fly.

                            BENDER
               You gotta go!

     Everyone is now looking at Bender.

                            CLAIRE
                   (disgusted)
               Oh my God!

                            ANDREW
               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!

                            BENDER
               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes
               it crawl back up!

                            ANDREW
               You whip it out and you're dead
               before the first drop hits the
               floor!

     Bender gasps mockingly.

                            BENDER
               You're pretty sexy when you get
               angry...grrr!

     He turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Hey, homeboy...

     Brian points at himself with his pen.

                            BENDER
              ...why don't you go close that door.
               We'll get the prom queen--
               impregnated!

     Claire turns and glares at him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!

     Bender ignores him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!
                          BENDER
               What?

                            ANDREW
               If I lose my temper, you're totalled
               man!

                            BENDER
               Totally?

                            ANDREW
               Totally!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody
               here is interested!

                            ANDREW
               Really!
                    (to Claire about Bender)
               Buttface!

                            BENDER
               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to
               get in here?  Forget to wash your
               jock?

                            BRIAN
                    (nervous)
               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we
               should just write our papers...

                            ANDREW
                    (to Bender)
               Look, just because you live in here
               doesn't give you the right to be a
               pain in the ass...so knock it off!

     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.

                            BENDER
               It's a free country...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               He's just doing it to get a rise out
               of you!  Just ignore him...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if
               you tried!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                           BENDER
               So...so!
                    (to Andrew and Claire)
               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-
               friend?
                    (a beat)
               Steady dates?
                    (another beat)
               Lo--vers?
                    (another beat)
               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do
               you slip her the hot...beef...
               injection?

     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screams)
               Go to hell!

                            ANDREW
                    (screams)
               Enough!

     We see Vernon in his office.

               Hey!  What's going on in there?
                    (to himself)
               Smug little pricks!

8. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from
     Bender.

                            ANDREW
                    (to himself)
               Scumbag!

     Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits
     on it.

                            BENDER
               What do you say we close that door.
               We can't have any kind of party
               with Vernon checking us out every
               few seconds.

                            BRIAN
               Well, you know the door's s'posed to
               stay open...

                           BENDER
               So what?

                           ANDREW
               So why don't you just shut up!
               There's four other people in here
               you know...

                            BENDER
               God, you can count.  See!  I knew
               you had to be smart to be a...a
               wrestler.

                            ANDREW
               Who the hell are you to judge
               anybody anyway?

                            CLAIRE
               Really...

                            ANDREW
               You know, Bender...you don't even
               count.  I mean if you disappeared
               forever it wouldn't make any
               difference.  You may as well not
               even exist at this school.

     Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
     before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out,
     however.

                            BENDER
               Well...I'll just run right out and
               join the wrestling team.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
     Bender.

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Maybe the prep club too!  Student
               council...

                            ANDREW
               No, they wouldn't take you.

                            BENDER
               I'm hurt.

                            CLAIRE
               You know why guys like you knock
               everything...

                            BENDER
                    (to himself)
               Oh, this should be stunning...

                            CLAIRE
               It's 'cause you're afraid.

                            BENDER
                    (with mock enthusiasm)
               Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart,
               that's exactly why I'm not heavy in
               activities!

                            CLAIRE
               You're a big coward!

     Brian feels left out.

                            BRIAN
                    (to no one imparticular)
               I'm in the math club...

                            CLAIRE
               See you're afraid that they won't
               take you.  You don't belong so you
               just have to dump all over it...

                            BENDER
               Well...it wouldn't have anything to
               do with you activities people being
               assholes...now would it?

                            CLAIRE
               Well you wouldn't know...You don't
               even know any of us.

                            BENDER
               Well, I don't know any lepers
               either, but I'm not gonna run out
               and join one of their fucking clubs.

                            ANDREW
               Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?

     Brian again feels he needs to contribute.

                            BRIAN
               I'm in the physics club too...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               S'cuse me a sec...
                    (to Brian)
               What are you babbling about?

                            BRIAN
               Well, what I said was...I'm in the
               math club, the Latin club and the
               physics club...physics club.

     Bender nods and turns to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the
               physics club?

                            CLAIRE
               That's an academic club...

                            BENDER
               So?

                            CLAIRE
               So...academic clubs aren't the same
               as other kinds of clubs.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but to dorks like him...

     Bender points at Brian.

                            BENDER
               ...they are.
                    (to Brian)
               What do you guys do in your club?

                            BRIAN
               In physics, um, we ah, we talk about
               physics...about properties of physics.

                            BENDER
               So it's sorta social...demented and
               sad, but social.  Right?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, well, I guess you could
               consider it a social situation.  I
               mean there are other children in my
               club and uh, at the end of the year
               we have, um, you know, a big
               banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.

                            BENDER
               You load up, you party...

                            BRIAN
               Well, no, we get dressed up...I
               mean, but, we don't...we don't get
               high.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Only burners like you get high...

                            BRIAN
               And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
               So I had to borrow my dad's.  It
               was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
               like me to wear other people's
               shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my
               cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
               He got high once and you know, he
               started eating like really weird
               foods.  And uh, and then he just
               felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
               You know, kinda like, you know
               "Twilight Zone" kinda.

                            CLAIRE
                    (laughs)
                    (to Bender)
               Sounds like you...

                            ANDREW
               Look, you guys keep up your talking
               and Vernon's gonna come right in
               here...I got a meet this Saturday
               and I'm not gonna miss it on account
               of you boneheads...

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

     Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.

                            BENDER
               Missing a whole wrestling meet!

                            ANDREW
               Well you wouldn't know anything
               about it, faggot!  You never competed
               in your whole life!

                            BENDER
                    (with mock hurt)
               Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
               because of it.  I have such a deep
               admiration for guys that roll around
               on the floor with other guys!

                            ANDREW
               Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You
               don't have any goals.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but I do!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah?

                            BENDER
               I wanna be just--like--you!  I
               figure all I need's a labotamy and
               some tights!

     Brian becomes interested.

                            BRIAN
               You wear tights?

                            ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               No I don't wear tights, I wear the
               required uniform...

                            BRIAN
               Tights...

                            ANDREW
                    (defensive)
               Shut up!

     They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
     quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
     Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table.
     Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and
     gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors
     that separate the library from the hallway.

                            BRIAN
               You know there's not s'posed to be
               any monkey business!

     Bender turns and points at Brian.

                            BENDER
                    (in a stern voice)
               Young man...have you finished your
               paper?

     Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks
     around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.

                            CLAIRE
               What are you gonna do?

                            ANDREW
               Drop dead, I hope!
                                                  CUT TO:

9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands
     up and checks the way he looks in a mirror.  He does a
     muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish Cobadonga!
                                                  CUT TO:

10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Brian looks up.  Bender is messing with the door to the
     library.

                            BRIAN
               Bender, that's, that's school
               property there...you know, it doesn't
               belong to us.  It's something not to
               be toyed with.

     The door slams shut.  Bender runs back to his seat.

                            ANDREW
               That's very funny, come on, fix it!

                            BRIAN
               You should really fix that!

                            BENDER
               Am I a genius?

                            ANDREW
               No, you're an asshole!

                            BENDER
               What a funny guy!

                            ANDREW
               Fix the door Bender!

                            BENDER
               Everyone just shhh!
                                                  CUT TO:

11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon walking back to his office.  He stops and
     listens to them through the closed door.

                         BENDER (OS)
               I've been here before, I know what
               I'm doing!

                         ANDREW (OS)
               No!  Fix the door, get up there and
               fix it!

                         BENDER (OS)
                    (screams)
               Shut up!
                                                  CUT TO:

12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     He opens the door and storms in.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

     For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare
     at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

                            BENDER
               How're we s'posed to know?  We're
               not s'posed to move, right?

     Vernon turns to Claire.

                            VERNON
               Why?

                            CLAIRE
               We were just sitting here, like we
               were s'posed to...

     Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.

                            VERNON
               Who closed that door?

                            BENDER
               I think a screw fell out of it...

                            ANDREW
               It just closed, sir...

     Vernon looks at Allison in the back.

                            VERNON
               Who?

     Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the
     table, hiding in her jacket hood.

                            BENDER
               She doesn't talk, sir...

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Give me that screw...

                            BENDER
              I don't have it...

                            VERNON
               You want me to yank you outta that
               seat and shake it out of you?

                            BENDER
               I don't have it...screws fall out
               all of the time, the world's an
               imperfect place...

                            VERNON
               Give it to me, Bender...

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir, why would anybody
               want to steal a screw?

                            VERNON
                    (to Claire)
               Watch it, young lady...

     Vernon goes over to the door.  He tries to hold it open
     by putting a folding chair in front of it.

                            BENDER
               The door's way too heavy, sir.

     The door slams shut despite the chair.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     They laugh.

     Vernon opens the door again.  He comes back in.

                            VERNON
                    (pointing)
               Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on,
               front and center, let's go.

     Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon.

                            BENDER
               Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
               If he gets up, we'll all get up,
               it'll be anarchy!

     Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel
     magazine rack in front of the door.

                            VERNON
              Okay, now, watch the magazines!

                            BENDER
               It's out of my hands...

     They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire
     door.

                            BENDER
               That's very clever sir, but what if
               there's a fire?  I think violating
               fire codes and endangering the
               lives of children would be unwise
               at this juncture in your career, sir.

     Vernon thinks about it.  He turns to Andrew.

                            VERNON
               Alright, what are you doing with
               this?  Get this outta here for God's
               sake!  What's the matter with you?
               Come on!

                            BRIAN
               You know the school comes equipped
               with fire exits at either end of the
               library.

     Brian points at them and Bender glares at him.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               Show Dick some respect!

     Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of
     the library.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               Let's go...go!  Get back into your
               seat.

     Andrew sits.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               I expected a little more from a
               varsity letterman!
                    (to Bender)
               You're not fooling anybody, Bender!
               The next screw that falls out is
               gonna be you!

     Vernon turns to leave.

                            BENDER
                    (under his breath)
               Eat my shorts...

     Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.

                            VERNON
               What was that?

                            BENDER
                    (loudly)
               Eat my shorts!

                            VERNON
               You just bought yourself another
               Saturday, mister!

                            BENDER
               Oh, Christ...

                            VERNON
               You just bought one more right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Well, I'm free the Saturday after
               that...beyond that, I'm gonna have
               to check my calendar!

                            VERNON
               Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled,
               we'll keep goin'!  You want another
               one?  Say the word, just say the
               word!  Instead of going to prison,
               you'll come here!  Are you through.

                            BENDER
               No!

                            VERNON
               I'm doing society a favor!

                            BENDER
               So?

                            VERNON
               That's another one, right now!  I've
               got you for the rest of your natural
               born life if you don't watch your
               step!  You want another one?

                            BENDER
               Yes!

                            VERNON
               You got it!  You got another one,
               right there!  That's another one
               pal!

                            CLAIRE
                    (worried)
               Cut it out!

     Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               Not even close, bud!

                            VERNON
               Good!  You got one more, right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Do you really think I give a shit?

                            VERNON
               Another...

     Bender glares at him.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               How many is that?

                            BRIAN
               That's seven including the one when
               we first came in and you asked Mr.
               Vernon here whether Barry Manilow
               knew that he raided his closet.

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Now it's eight...
                    (to Brian)
               You stay out of it!

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me, sir, it's seven!

                            VERNON
               Shut up, Peewee!
                    (to Bender)
               You're mine Bender...for two months
               I gotcha!  I gotcha!

                            BENDER
               What can I say?  I'm thrilled!

                            VERNON
               Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you
               want these people to believe.  You
               know something, Bender?  You ought
               to spend a little more time trying
               to do something with yourself and a
               little less time trying to impress
               people.  You might be better off.
                    (to everyone)
               Alright, that's it!  I'm going to
               be right outside those doors.  The
               next time I hafta come in here...I'm
               cracking skulls!  (Bender mouths Im
               cracking skulls)

     Vernon leaves and closes the door.  A musical riff
     builds to a climax as Bender screams.

                            BENDER
                    (screams)
               Fuck you!

     We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight.

     We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a
     cigarette with his shoe.

     We see Claire thinking.

     We see Brian playing with his balls.

     We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt.

     We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and
     making it turn purple.

     We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then
     plays air guitar.

     We see Allison drawing.

     We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers
     silently.

     Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.

     We see everyone fall asleep.
                                                  CUT TO:

13. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.

                            VERNON
               Wake up!  Who has to go to the
               lavatory?

     Everyone raises their hands.
                                                  CUT TO:

14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     We see the clock, it now says 10:22.

     We see Andrew stretching.  We see Bender tearing pages
     out of a book.  He is tossing them around.

                            ANDREW
               That's real intelligent.

                            BENDER
               You're right...it's wrong to
               destroy literature...

     He continues to tear pages out.

                            BENDER
               It's such fun to read...and, Molet
               really pumps my nads!

                            CLAIRE
                    (pronouncing it correctly)
               Mol-yare.

                            BRIAN
              I love his work.

     Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian.  He picks
     up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards
     out.

                            BENDER
               Big deal...nothing to do when you're
               locked in a vacancy..

                           ANDREW
               Speak for yourself...

                            BENDER
               Do you think I'd speak for you?  I
               don't even know your language!

     Andrew turns to Claire.

                            ANDREW
               Hey, you grounded tonight?

     Claire shrugs.

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, my mom said I was but
               by dad told me to just blow her off.

                            ANDREW
               Big party at Stubbies, parents are
               in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah, can you go?

                            CLAIRE
               I doubt it...

                            ANDREW
               How come?

                            CLAIRE
               Well 'cause if I do what my mother
               tells me not to do, it's because
               because my father says it's okay.
               There's like this whole big monster
               deal, it's endless and it's a total
               drag.  It's like any minute...
               divorce...

                            BENDER
               Who do you like better?

                            CLAIRE
               What?

                            BENDER
               You like your old man better than
               your mom?

                            CLAIRE
               They're both strict.

                            BENDER
               No, I mean, if you had to choose
               between them.

                            CLAIRE
               I dunno, I'd probably go live with
               my brother.  I mean, I don't think
               either one of them gives a shit
               about me...it's like they use me
               just to get back at each other.

     Suddenly, from the back of the room.  Allison speaks.

                           ALLISON
                    (loudly)
               Ha!!!

     Everyone looks at her shocked.  Allison blows her hair
     out of her eyes and grins.

                            CLAIRE
               Shut up!

                            ANDREW
               You're just feeling sorry for
               yourself...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else
               would.

                            ANDREW
               Aw...you're breaking my heart...

                            BENDER
               Sporto...

                            ANDREW
               What?

     Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.

                            BENDER
               You get along with your parents?

                            ANDREW
               Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,
               right?

                            BENDER
               You're an idiot anyway...But if you
               say you get along with your parents
               well you're a liar too!

     Bender turns and walks away from him.  Andrew follows
     and pushes Bender.

                            ANDREW
               You know something, man...If we
               weren't in school right now, I'd
               waste you!

     Bender points his middle finger at the floor.

                            BENDER
               Can you hear this?  Want me to turn
               it up?

     Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew
     the bird.

     Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's
     shoulders.

                            BRIAN
               Hey fellas, I mean...

     Andrew pushes away from Brian.

                            BRIAN
               ...I don't like my parents either,
               I don't...I don't get along with
               them...their idea of parental
               compassion is just, you know, wacko!

     Bender turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Dork...

                            BRIAN
              Yeah?

                            BENDER
               You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

     Bender starts to walk away.

                            BRIAN
               Well that's a problem!

                            BENDER
               Look, I can see you getting all
               bunged up for them making you wear
               these kinda clothes.  But face it,
               you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!
               What would you be doing if you
               weren't out making yourself a better
               citizen?

                            ANDREW
               Why do you have to insult everybody?

                            BENDER
               I'm being honest, asshole!  I would
               expect you...to know the difference!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah well, he's gotta name!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah,
                    (to Brian)
               What's your name?

                            BRIAN
               Brian...

                            ANDREW
               See...

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               My condolences...

     Bender walks away.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               What's your name?

                            BENDER
               What's yours?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...

                            BENDER
               Ka-Laire?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...it's a family name!

                            BENDER
               Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!

                            CLAIRE
               Well thank you...

                            BENDER
               You're welcome...

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not fat!

                            BENDER
               Well not at present but I could see
               you really pushing maximum density!
               You see, I'm not sure if you know
               this...but there are two kinds of
               fat people.  There's fat people that
               were born to be fat, and then there's
               fat people that were once thin but
               they became fat...so when you look
               at them you can sorta see that thin
               person inside!  You see, you're
               gonna get married, you're gonna
               squeeze out a few puppies and then,
               uh...

     He mimes becoming fat, making noises.

     Claire gives him the finger.

                            BENDER
               Oh...obscene finger gestures from
               such a pristine girl!

                            CLAIRE
                    (resentfully)
               I'm not that pristine!

     Bender bends down closer to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Are you a virgin?
                    (a beat)
               I'll bet you a million dollars that
               you are!  Let's end the suspense!
               Is it gonna be...
                    (another beat)
               ...a white weddin?

                            CLAIRE
               Why don't you just shut up?

                            BENDER
               Have you ever kissed a boy on the
               mouth?
                    (a beat)
               Have you ever been felt up?  Over
               the bra, under the blouse, shoes
               off...hoping to God your parents
               don't walk in?

     Claire is getting upset.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want me to puke?

                            BENDER
               Over the panties, no bra, blouse
               unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on
               the front seat past eleven on a
               school night?

                            ANDREW
               Leave her alone!

     Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.

                            ANDREW
               I said leave her alone!

                            BENDER
               You gonna make me?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

     Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.

                            BENDER
               You and how many of your friends?

                            ANDREW
               Just me, just you and me.  Two hits.
               Me hitting you, you hitting the
               floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal!

     Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on
     the ground with a wrestling move.

                            BENDER
               I don't wanna get into to this with
               you man...

     Andrew gets up.

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

     Bender gets up.

                            BENDER
               'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.
               I'd kill you and your fucking parents
               would sue me and it would be a big
               mess and I don't care enough about
               you to bother.

                            ANDREW
               Chicken shit...

     Andrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a
     switchblade and opens it.

     He stabs the switchblade into a chair.

                            ANDREW
               Let's end this right now.  You don't
               talk to her...you don't look at her
               and you don't even think about her!
               You understand me?

                            BENDER
               I'm trying to help her!.

     We see the janitor, CARL come into the room.

                             CARL
               Brian, how you doing?

                            BENDER
               Your dad works here?

     Brian is embarrassed.

                            BENDER
               Uh, Carl?

                             CARL
               What?

                            BENDER
               Can I ask you a question?

                             CARL
               Sure...

                            BENDER
               How does one become a janitor?

                             CARL
               You wanna be a janitor?

                            BENDER
               No I just wanna know how one becomes
               a janitor because Andrew here, is
               very interested in persuing a
               career in the custodial arts...

                             CARL
               Oh, really?  You guys think I'm
               just some untouchable peasant?  Peon?
               Huh?  Maybe so, but following
               a broom around after shitheads like
               you for the past eight years I've
               learned a couple of things...I look
               through your letters, I look through
               your lockers...I listen to your
               conversations, you don't know that
               but I do...I am the eyes and ears of
               this institution my friends.  By the
               way, that clock's twenty minutes
               fast!

     Everyone groans.  Bender smiles.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

16. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Bender starts to whistle a marching tune and everybody
     joins in.

     Vernon enters.  Bender begins to whistle Beethoven's
     5th.

                            VERNON
               Allright girls, that's thirty
               minutes for lunch...

                            ANDREW
               Here?

                            VERNON
               Here...

                            ANDREW
               Well I think the cafeteria would be
               a more suitable place for us to eat
               lunch in, sir!

                            VERNON
               Well, I don't care what you think,
               Andrew!

                            BENDER
               Uh, Dick?  Excuse me, Rich...will
               milk be made available to us?

                            ANDREW
               We're extremely thirsty sir...

                            CLAIRE
               I have a very low tolerance for
               dehydration.

                            ANDREW
               I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's
               pretty gross.

     Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Relax, I'll get it!

                            VERNON
               Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub!

     Bender grins.

                            VERNON
               What do you think, I was born
               yesterday?  You think I'm gonna
               have you roaming these halls?

     He points at Andrew.

                            VERNON
               You!

     He points at Allison.

                            VERNON
               And you!  Hey!  What's her name?
               Wake her!  Wake her up!
                    (to Allison)
               Come on, on your feet missy!  Let's
               go!  This is no rest home!

     Allison gets up.

                            VERNON
               There's a soft drink machine in the
               teacher's lounge.  Lets go!

16. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Andrew and Allison are walking in the hall.

                            ANDREW
               So, what's your poison?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               What do you drink?

     Allison still doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Okay...forget I asked...

     Allison waits for two beats and then speaks.

                           ALLISON
               Vodka...

                            ANDREW
               Vodka?  When do you drink vodka?

                           ALLISON
               Whenever...

                            ANDREW
              A lot?

     Allison smiles.

                           ALLISON
               Tons...

                            ANDREW
               Is that why you're here today?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Why are you here?

     Allison snaps back.

                           ALLISON
               Why are you here?

     They stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall.

                            ANDREW
               Um, I'm here today...because uh,
               because my coach and my father don't
               want me to blow my ride.  See I get
               treated differently because uh,
               Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does
               my old man.  I'm not a winner
               because I wanna be one... I'm a
               winner because I got strength and
               speed.  Kinda like a race horse.
               That's about how involved I am in
               what's happening to me.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah?  That's very interesting.
               Now why don't you tell me why you're
               really in here.

                            ANDREW
               Forget it!

17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around
     waiting for the Cokes.

                            BENDER
               Claire...you wanna see a picture of
               a guy with elephantitus of the nuts?
               It's pretty tasty...

                            CLAIRE
               No thank you...

                            BENDER
               How do you think he rides a bike?

     Claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust.

                            BENDER
               Oh, Claire...would you ever consider
               dating a guy like this?

                            CLAIRE
               Can't you just leave me alone?

                            BENDER
               I mean if he had a great personality
               and was a good dancer and had a cool
               car...Although you'd probably have
               to ride in the back seat 'cause his
               nuts would ride shotgun.

                            CLAIRE
               You know what I wish I was doing?

                            BENDER
               Op, watch what you say, Brian here
               is a cherry.

                            BRIAN
               A cherry?

                            CLAIRE
               I wish I was on a plane to France.

                            BRIAN
               I'm not a cherry.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               When have you ever gotten laid?

                            BRIAN
               I've laid, lotsa times!

                            BENDER
               Name one!

                            BRIAN
               She lives in Canada, met her at
               Niagra Falls.  You wouldn't know
               her.

                            BENDER
               Ever laid anyone around here.

     Brian shushes Bender and points at Claire whos back is
     still turned.

                            BRIAN
                    Oh, you and Claire, did it!

     Claire spins around.

                            CLAIRE
              What are you talking about?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               Nothin', nothin!
                    (to Bender)
               Let's just drop it, we'll talk about
               it later!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Drop what, what're you talking
               about?

                            BENDER
               Well, Brian's trying to tell me that
               in addition to the number of girls
               in the Niagra Falls area, that
               presently you and he are, riding
               the hobby horse!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Brian)
               Little pig!

                            BRIAN
               No I'm not!  I'm not!  John said I
               was a cherry and I said I wasn't,
               that's it, that's all that was said!

                            BENDER
               Well then what were you motioning to
               Claire for?

                            CLAIRE
               You know I don't appreciate this
               very much, Brian.

                            BRIAN
               He is lying!

                            BENDER
               Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               You know he's lying, right?

                            BENDER
               Were you or were you not motioning
               to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, but it was only...was only
               because I didn't want her to know
               that I was a virgin, okay?

     Bender just stares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm
               sorry...

     Claire laughs.

                            CLAIRE
               Why didn't you want me to know you
               were a virgin?

                            BRIAN
               Because it's personal business, it's
               my personal, private business.

                            BENDER
               Well Brian, it doesn't sound like
               you're doing any business...

                            CLAIRE
               I think it's okay for a guy to be a
               virgin...

     Bender looks suprised.

                            BRIAN
               You do?

     Claire smiles and nods.
                                                  CUT TO:

18.  INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     Everybody has lunches now.

     Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.

                            BENDER
               What's in there?

                            CLAIRE
               Guess, where's your lunch?

                            BENDER
               You're wearing it...

                            CLAIRE
               You're nauseating...

     Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
     catches it without even looking up.

     Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.

                            BENDER
               What's that?

                            CLAIRE
               Sushi...

                            BENDER
               Sushi?

                            CLAIRE
               Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed.

                            BENDER
               You won't accept a guys tongue in
               your mouth and you're gonna eat
               that?

                            CLAIRE
               Can I eat?

                            BENDER
               I don't know...give it a try...

     We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his
     bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
     of cookies and a carton of milk.

     Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly
     slurps it up off the table and her fingers.

     Andrew sees Bender looking at him.

                            ANDREW
               What's your problem?

     Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
     It lands on the sculpture above.

     She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the
     sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that.
     She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it.

     Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes
     Brian's bag lunch.

                            BENDER
               What're we having?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, it's your standard, regular
               lunch I guess...

     Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos.  He
     sets it on the table and points at it.

                            BENDER
               Milk?

                            BRIAN
               Soup.

     Bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box.
     Brian reaches toward the bag and Bender slaps his hand.

                            BRIAN
               That's apple juice...

                            BENDER
               I can read!  PB & J with the crusts
               cut off...Well Brian, this is a
               very nutritous lunch, all the food
               groups are represented.  Did your
               mom marry Mr. Rogers?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, no, Mr. Johnson...

                            BENDER
               Ahhh....

     Andrew and Claire smile at each other.  Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Here's my impression of life at big
               Bri's house...
                    (in a loud and friendly voice)
               Son!
                    (in a kiddie voice)
               Yeah Dad?
                    (loud)
               How's your day, pal?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, how's yours?
                    (loud)
               Super, say son, how'd you like to go
               fishing this weekend?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, but I've got homework to
               do!
                    (loud)
               That's alright son, you can do it,
               on the boat!
                    (kiddie)
               Geee!!!
                    (loud)
               Dear, isn't our son swell?
                    (quiet and motherly)
               Yes Dear, isn't life swell?

     Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father
     kissing mother and then father punching mother in the
     face.

     Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.

                            ANDREW
               Alright, what about your family?

                            BENDER
               Oh, mine?

                            ANDREW
               That's real easy!

     Bender stands again and points forward.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Stupid, worthless, no good, God
               damned, freeloading, son of a bitch,
               retarded, bigmouth, know it all,
               asshole, jerk!
                       (as his mother)
               You forgot ugly, lazy and
               disrespectful.

     Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable
     mother.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Shut up bitch!  Go fix me a turkey
               pot pie!
                    (as himself)
               What about you Dad?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself--yelling)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father--yelling)
               Fuck you!

     He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him.

                            BRIAN
               Is that for real?

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               You wanna come over sometime?

                            ANDREW
               That's bullshit.  It's all part of
               your image, I don't believe a word
               of it.

     Bender actually looks hurt.

                     BENDER
               You don't believe me?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BENDER
               No?

                            ANDREW
               Did I stutter?

     Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right
     sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.

                            BENDER
               Do you believe this?  Huh?  It's
               about the size of a cigar...Do I
               stutter?  You see, this is what you
               get in my house when you spill paint
               in the garage.

     Bender begins to walk away.

                            BENDER
               See I don't think that I need to
               sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

     Bender walks over to a map table and throws all the
     maps on the floor.  He climbs up on top of the table and
     then up to the second floor balcony.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               You shouldn't have said that!

                            ANDREW
               How would I know, I mean he lies
               about everything anyway!
                                                 CUT TO:

19. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to
     pour coffee out of his thermos.  The top comes off and
     the coffee goes all over his desk.

                            VERNON
               Oh, shit!
                                                  CUT TO:

20. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.

                            VERNON
               Coffee...looks like they scrape it
               off the bottom of the Mississippi
               river.  Everything's polluted,
               everything's polluted...the coffee.

     Bender comes out of the library doors followed
     bye veryone else.

     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.
     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the
     end of the line, Allison is following.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               How do you know where Vernon went?

                            BENDER
               I don't...

                            CLAIRE
               Well then, how do you know when he'll
               be back?

                            BENDER
               I don't...being bad feels pretty
               good, huh?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               What's the point in going to Bender's
               locker?

                            ANDREW
               Beats me...

                            BRIAN
               This is so stupid...Why do you think,
               why are we risking getting caught?

                            ANDREW
               I dunno...

                            BRIAN
               So then what are we doing?

                            ANDREW
               You ask me one more question and I'm
               beating the shit out of you!

                            BRIAN
               Sorry...

     Bender opens his locker.

                            ANDREW
               Slob!

                            BENDER
               My maid's on vacation.

     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.

                            BRIAN
               Drugs...

                            ANDREW
              Screw that Bender...put it back!

     Bender walks away.

                         BRIAN
               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.

     Claire walks after Bender.

                            BRIAN
               That was marijuana!

                            ANDREW
               Shut up!

     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison
     who is standing there with her mouth open.

                            BRIAN
               Do you approve of this?

     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of
     Bender's locker.

     We see the crowd walking down the hall.

                            BENDER
               We'll cross through the lab, and
               then we'll double back.

                            ANDREW
               You better be right, if Vernon cuts
               us off it's your fault, asshole!

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               What'd he say?  Where're we going?

     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various
     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon
     until they stop.

                            BENDER
               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We
               have to go through the cafeteria!

                            ANDREW
               No, the activities hall.

                            BENDER
               Hey man, you don't know what you're
               talking about!

                            ANDREW
               No you don't know what you're
               talking about!

     Allison squeaks.

                            ANDREW
               Now we're through listening to you,
               we're going this way.

     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by
     an iron gate.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

                            BENDER
               Great idea Jagoff!

                            ANDREW
               Fuck you!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to
               John?

                            BRIAN
               We're dead!

                            BENDER
               No, just me!

                            BRIAN
               What do you mean?

                            BENDER
               Get back to the library, keep your
               unit on this!

     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's
     underwear.

     Bender runs away singing loudly.  I wanna be an
     airborne ranger...

     We see Vernon hear Bender.

     The rest of them run.

                            VERNON
               That son of a bitch!

     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in
     the gym.

     Bender is going up for a basket.

                            BENDER
               Three...two...one!

     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is
               this?  What are you doing here, what
               is this?

                            BENDER
               Oh, hi!

                            VERNON
               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's
               over!

                            BENDER
               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?

                            VERNON
               Out!

                            BENDER
               I'm thinking of trying out for a
               scholarship.

                            VERNON
               Gimmie the ball, Bender.

     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball
     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.

     They leave.

21. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     The rest of the kids are all sitting back in their
     seats when Bender and Vernon enter.  Vernon pushes Bender.

                            VERNON
               Get your stuff, let's go!
                    (to everyone)
               Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon
               himself to go to the gymnasium.  I'm
               sorry to inform you, you're going to
               be without his services for the rest
               of the day.

                            BENDER
                    (to Vernon)
               B-O-O H-O-O!

                            VERNON
               Everything's a big joke, huh Bender?
               The false alarm you pulled, Friday,
               false alarms are really funny,
               aren't they...What if your home,
               what if your family...
                    (a beat)
               ...what if your dope was on fire?

                            BENDER
               Impossible, sir...It's in Johnson's
               underwear...

     Andrew laughs.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               You think he's funny?  You think
               this is cute?  You think he's
               bitchin', is that it?  Lemme tell
               you something.  Look at him, he's a
               bum.
                    (to everybody)
               You wanna see something funny?  You
               go visit John Bender in five years!
               You'll see how God damned funny he
               is!
                    (to Bender)
               What's the matter, John?  You gonna
               cry?  Let's go...

     Vernon grabs Bender's shoulder.

                            BENDER
               Hey keep your fuckin' hands off me!
               I expect better manners from you,
               Dick!

     Bender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays
     them in front of Andrew.

                            BENDER
               For better hallway vision!

     Bender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the
     way.

21. INT. CLOSET - DAY

     Vernon has put Bender in a closet and is in there
     talking to him.

                            VERNON
               That's the last time, Bender.  That's
               the last time you ever make me look
               bad in front of those kids, do you
               hear me?  I make $31,000 dollars a
               year and I have a home and I'm not
               about to throw it away on some punk
               like you...But someday, man, someday.
               When you're outta here and you've
               forgotten all about this place...
               And they've forgotten all about you
               and you're wrapped up in your own
               pathetic life...I'm gonna be there.
               That's right.  And I'm gonna kick
               the living shit out of you, man, I'm
               gonna knock your dick in the dirt!

                            BENDER
               Are you threatening me?

                            VERNON
               What're you gonna do about it?  You
               think anybody's gonna believe you?
               You think anybody's gonna take your
               word over mine?  I'm a man of
               respect around here.  They love me
               around here, I'm a swell guy...you're
               a lying sack of shit!  And everybody
               knows it.  Oh, you're a real tough
               guy...come on, come on...get on your
               feet, pal!  Let's find out how
               tough you are!  I wanna know right
               now, how tough you are!  Come on!
               I'll give you the first punch, let's
               go!  Come on, right here, just take
               the first shot!  Please, I'm begging
               you, take a shot!  Come on, just
               take one shot, that's all I need,
               just one swing...

     Bender just sits there staring at Vernon.  Vernon fakes
     a punch and Bender flinches.

                            VERNON
               That's what I though...you're a
               gutless turd!

     Vernon leaves and locks the closet door after him.
     Bender climbs into a hatch in the ceiling and
     disappears.

               A naked blond walks into a bar, with
               a poodle under one arm and a two
               foot salami under the other.  She
               lays the poodle on the table.  Bar-
               tender says: "I suppose you won't
               be needing a drink."  The naked
               lady says...

     The ceiling under Bender gives and he falls through.

     We hear Vernon in the hall.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!  What in God's name is
               going on in here?

     Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
              What was that ruckus?

                            ANDREW
               Uh, what ruckus?

                            VERNON
               I was just in my office and I heard
               a ruckus!

                            BRIAN
               Could you describe the ruckus, sir?

                            VERNON
               Watch your tongue young man, watch
               it!

     We see Bender under the table by Claire's legs.  He
     sits up and bangs his head on the table.  He groans.

     Above the table, Andrew and Claire try to take credit
     for the noise by making more noise.

                            VERNON
               What is that?  What, what is that,
               what is that noise?

     Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and
     can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's
     legs.

                            ANDREW
               What noise?

                            CLAIRE
               Really, sir, there wasn't any noise...

     Claire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her
     knees.

     Everyone starts faking a coughing fit.

                            CLAIRE
                    (flustered)
               That noise?  Was that the noise you
               were talking about?

                            VERNON
               No, it wasn't.  That was not the
               noise I was talking about.  Now, I
               may not have caught you in the act
               this time, but you can bet I will.

     Allison laughs at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               You make book on that missy!
                    (to Claire)
               And you!  I will not be made a fool
               of!

     He turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the
     toilet seat cover stuck to his pants.
     Vernon leaves.

     Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a
     barage of slaps.

                            BENDER
               It was an accident!

     Bender gets up and walks over to Brian.

               So, Ahab...Kybo Mein Doobage...

     Brian gives Bender his bag of marajuana.  Bender turns

     Brian laughs at her.  He exhales and tries to eat the
     smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice.

                            BRIAN
               Chicks, cannot hold der smoke!  That's

     Brian waves Claire over to him and he falls over.

     We see Andrew emerge from a really smokey room.  He
     inhales another puff and then starts dancing to
     everybody's applause.

     He goes back in the room he was in.  He screams and it
     shatters the glass in the door.

               Your middle name is Ralph, as in
               puke...

     Brian and Andrew look at her in confusion.

               ...your birthday is March 12th,
               you're five-nine and a half you

               you know all this about me?

     Allison reaches in her bag.

                           ALLISON
               I stole your wallet...

     She produces it in her hands and grins.

                            BRIAN

     We see Bender, he is brushing his teeth with one of
     Claire's cosmetic brushes.

     We see Claire looking through Bender's wallet pictures.

                            CLAIRE
               Are all these your girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               Some of them...

                            CLAIRE
               What about the others?

                            BENDER
               Well, some I consider my girlfriends
               and some...I just consider...

                            CLAIRE
               Consider what?

                            BENDER
               Whether or not, I wanna hang out
               with them...

                            CLAIRE
               You don't believe in just one guy,
               one girl?

                            BENDER
               Do you?

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah...that's the way it should be.

                            BENDER
               Well, not for me...

                            CLAIRE
               Why not?

     Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that.  He acts
     defensive.

                            BENDER
               How come you got so much shit in
               your purse?

                            CLAIRE
               How come you got so many
               girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               I asked you first...

                            CLAIRE
                    (shrugs)
               I dunno...I guess I never throw
               anything away.

                            BENDER
               Neither do I...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh...

     We cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are
     sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet.

                            ANDREW
               This is the worst fake ID I've ever
               seen...

     Brian laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Do you realize you made yourself
               sixty eight?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, I know...I know, I goofed it...

                            ANDREW
               What do you need a fake ID for?

                            BRIAN
                    (like it's obvious)
               So I can vote!

     Allison looks up suddenly.

                           ALLISON
               You wanna see what's in my bag?

                        BRIAN & ANDREW
               No!

     Allison looks hurt and then resentful.  Just to spite
     them, she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch.

     Lots of stuff comes out.

                            ANDREW
               Holy shit!  What is all that stuff?

                            BRIAN
               Do you always carry this much shit
               in your bag?

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...I always carry this much shit
               ...in my bag...You never know when
               you may have to jam...

                            BRIAN
               Are you gonna be like a shopping
               bag lady?  You know like, sit in
               alleyways and like talk to buildings
               and wear men's shoes and that kinda
               thing?

                           ALLISON
               I'll do what I have to do...

                            BRIAN
               Why do you have to do anything?

                           ALLISON
                    (with feeling)
               My home life is un...satisfying...

                            BRIAN
               So you're saying you'd subject
               yourself to the violent dangers of
               the Chicago streets because your
               homelife is unsatisfying?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have to run away and live
               in the street...I can run away and,
               go to the ocean, I can go to the
               country, I can go to the mountains.
               I can go to Israel, Africa,
               Afghanistan...

     Brian looks at her and then moves over to Andrew.

                            BRIAN
               Andy...you wanna get in on this?
               Allison here says, she wants to run
               away, because her home life is
               unsatisfying...

                            ANDREW
               Well everyone's home lives are un-
               satisfying...If it wasn't, people
               would live with there parents
               forever...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, yeah I understand.  But I
               think that her's goes beyond, you
               know, what guys like you and me...
               consider normal unsatisfying...

                           ALLISON
               Nevermind...forget it, everything's
               cool!

     Allison starts putting everything back in her purse.

                            ANDREW
               What's the deal?

                           ALLISON
               No!  There's no deal, Sporto.
               Forget it, leave me alone.

                            ANDREW
               Wait a minute, now you're carrying
               all that crap around in your purse.
               Either you really wanna run away or
               you want people to think you wanna
               run away.

                           ALLISON
               Eat shit!

     Allison gets up and walks away.

                            BRIAN
               The girl is an island, with herself.
               Okay?

     Andrew gets up and goes after her.

                            ANDREW
               Hi, you wanna talk?

                           ALLISON
               No!

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

                           ALLISON
               Go away...

                            ANDREW
               Where do you want me to go?

                           ALLISON
               GO away!

     Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry.

                           ALLISON
               You have problems...

                            ANDREW
               Oh, I have problems?

                           ALLISON
               You do everything everybody ever
               tells you to do, that is a problem!

                            ANDREW
               Okay, fine...but I didn't dump my
               purse out on the couch and invite
               people into my problems...Did I?
               So what's wrong?  What is it?  Is
               is bad?  Real bad?  Parents?

     Allison is silently crying.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...

     Andrew nods.

                            ANDREW
               What do they do to you?

                           ALLISON
              They ignore me...

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...yeah...

     They both are crying silently.
                                                  CUT TO:

29. INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Vernon and Carl are sitting talking.

                            VERNON
               What did you want to be when you
               were young?

                             CARL
               When I was a kid, I wanted to be
               John Lennon...

                            VERNON
               Carl don't be a goof!  I'm trying
               to make a serious point here...I've
               been teaching, for twenty two years,
               and each year...these kids get more
               and more arrogant.

                             CARL
               Aw bull shit, man.  Come on Vern,
               the kids haven't changed, you have!
               You took a teaching position, 'cause
               you thought it'd be fun, right?
               Thought you could have summer
               vacations off...and then you found
               out it was actually work...and that
               really bummed you out.

                            VERNON
               These kids turned on me...they think
               I'm a big fuckin' joke...

                             CARL
               Come on...listen Vern, if you were
               sixteen, what would you think of
               you, huh?

                            VERNON
               Hey...Carl, you think I give one
               rat's ass what these kids think of
               me?

                             CARL
               Yes I do...

                            VERNON
               You think about this...when you get
               old, these kids; when I get old,
               they're gonna be runnin' the country.

                             CARL
               Yeah?

                            VERNON
               Now this is the thought that wakes
               me up in the middle of the night...
               That when I get older, these kids
               are gonna take care of me...

                             CARL
               I wouldn't count on it!

     Vernon ponders that statement for a moment.

30. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.

                            ANDREW
               What would I do for a million bucks?
               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I
               had to...

                            CLAIRE
               That's boring...

                            ANDREW
               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?

                            CLAIRE
               The idea is to like search your mind
               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,
               would you drive to school naked?

     Andrew laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Um, uh...would I have to get out of
               the car?

                            CLAIRE
               Of course...

                            ANDREW
               In the spring, or winter?

                            CLAIRE
               It doesn't matter...spring...

                            ANDREW
               In front of the school or in back
               of the school?

                            CLAIRE
               Either one...

                            ANDREW
               Yes...

                           ALLISON
               I'd do that!

     They all look at her.

                           ALLISON
               I'll do anything sexual, I don't
               need a million dollars to do it
               either...

                            CLAIRE
               You're lying...

                           ALLISON
               I already have...I've done just
               about everything there is except a
               few things that are illegal...I'm a
               nymphomaniac!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                            CLAIRE
               Lie...

                            BRIAN
               Are your parents aware of this?

                           ALLISON
               The only person I told was my
               shrink...

                            ANDREW
               And what'd he do when you told him?

                           ALLISON
               He nailed me...

                            CLAIRE
               Very nice...

                           ALLISON
               I don't think that from a legal
               standpoint what he did can be
               construed as rape since I paid him.

                            CLAIRE
               He's an adult!

     Allison is relishing this attention.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...he's married too!

     Claire notes her disgust.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you have any idea how completely
               gross that is?

                           ALLISON
               Well, the first few times...

                            CLAIRE
               First few times?  You mean he did it
               more than once?

                           ALLISON
               Sure...

                            CLAIRE
               Are you crazy?

                            BRIAN
               Obviously she's crazy if she's
               screwing her shrink...

                           ALLISON
                    (to Claire)
               Have you ever done it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't even have a psychiatrist...

                           ALLISON
               Have you ever done it with a normal
               person?

                            CLAIRE
               Now, didn't we already cover this?

                            BENDER
               You never answered the question...

                            CLAIRE
               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my
               private life with total strangers.

                           ALLISON
               It's kind of a double-edged sword,
               isn't it?

                            CLAIRE
               A what?

                           ALLISON
               Well, if you say you haven't...
               you're a prude.  If you say you
               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.
               You want to but you can't but when
               you do you wish you didn't, right?

                            CLAIRE
               Wrong...

                           ALLISON
               Or, are you a tease?

                            ANDREW
               She's a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh why don't you just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You're a tease and you know it, all
               girls are teases!

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               She's only a tease if what she does
               gets you hot...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't do anything!

                           ALLISON
               That's why you're a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.

     Allison is suddenly defensive.

                           ALLISON
               I've already told you everything!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep
               around without being in love.  I
               mean don't you want any respect?

                           ALLISON
               I don't screw to get respect...That's
               the difference between you and me...

                            CLAIRE
               Not the only difference, I hope.

                            BENDER
               Face it, you're a tease.

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not a tease!

                            BENDER
               Sure you are!  You said it yourself
               sex is a weapon, you use it to get
               respect!

                            CLAIRE
               No, I never said that, she twisted
               my words around.

                            BENDER
               Oh then what do you use it for?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't use it period!

     Claire is on the verge of tears.

                            BENDER
               Oh, are you medically frigid or is
               it psychological?

                            CLAIRE
               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys
               are putting words into my mouth!

                            BENDER
               Well if you'd just answer the
               question...

                            BRIAN
               Why don't you just answer the
               question?

                            ANDREW
               Be honest...

                            BENDER
               No big deal...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, answer it!

                            ANDREW
               Answer the question, Claire!

                            BENDER
               Talk to us!

                       ANDREW & BRIAN
               Come on, answer the question!

                            BENDER
               It's easy, it's only one question!

     Claire silences all of them by screaming.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screaming)
               No!  I never did it!

     Silence for two beats.

                           ALLISON
               I never did it either, I'm not a
               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive
               liar...

                            CLAIRE
               You are such a bitch!  You did that
               on purpose just to fuck me over!

                           ALLISON
               I would do it though...If you love
               someone it's okay...

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you, you're so
               weird.  You don't say anything all
               day and then when you open your
               mouth...you unload all these
               tremendous lies all over me!

                            ANDREW
               You're just pissed off because she
               got you to admit something you didn't
               want to admit to...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it
               any less bizarre...

                            ANDREW
               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all
               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just
               better at hiding it, that's all.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               How are you bizarre?

     Allison decides to field that question.

                           ALLISON
               He can't think for himself...

                            ANDREW
               She's right...do you guys know what,
               uh, what I did to get in here?  I
               taped Larry Lester's buns together.

     Claire laughs.

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               That was you?

                           ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               Yeah, you know him?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I know him...

                            ANDREW
               Well then you know how hairy he is,
               right?  Well, when they pulled the
               tape off, most of his hair came off
               and some, some skin too...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh my God...

                            ANDREW
               And the bizarre thing is, is that
               I did it for my old man...I
               tortured this poor kid, because I
               wanted him to think that I was cool.
               He's always going off about, you
               know, when he was in school...all
               the wild things he used to do.  And
               I got the feeling that he was
               disappointed that I never cut loose
               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
               sitting in the locker room, and I'm
               taping up my knee.  And Larry's
               undressing a couple lockers down
               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...
               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I
               started thinking about my father,
               and his attitude about weakness.
               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
               jumped on top of him and started
               wailing on him...And my friends,
               they just laughed and cheered me on.
               And afterwards, when I was sittin'
               in Vernon's office, all I could
               think about was Larry's father. And
               Larry havin' to go home and...and
               explain what happened to him.  And
               the humiliation...fucking
               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It
               mustuv been unreal...I mean,
                    (he's crying)
               I mean, how do you apologize for
               something like that?  There's no
               way...it's all because of me and
               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate
               him!  He's like this...he's like
               this mindless machine that I can't
               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
               you've got to be number one!  I
               won't tolerate any losers in this
               family...Your intensity is for shit!
               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a
               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish
               my knee would give...and I wouldn't
               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he
               could forget all about me...

                            BENDER
               I think your old man and my old man
               should get together and go bowling.

     Andrew laughs briefly.

                            BRIAN
               It's like me, you know, with my
               grades...like, when I, when I
               step outside myself kinda, and
               when I, when I look in at myself
               you know?  And I see me and I don't
               like what I see, I really don't.

                            CLAIRE
               What's wrong with you?  Why don't
               you like yourself?

                            BRIAN
               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing
               shop.  See we had this assignment,
               to make this ceramic elephant, and
               um...and we had eight weeks to do
               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was
               like a lamp, and when you pull the
               trunk the light was s'posed to go
               on...my light didn't go on, I got a
               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...
               When I signed up, you know, for the
               course I mean.  I thought I was
               playing it real smart, you know.
               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,
               it'll be such an easy way to
               maintain my grade point average...

                            BENDER
               Why'd you think it'd be easy?

                            BRIAN
               Have you seen some of the dopes that
               take shop?

                            BENDER
               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'
               idiot!

                            BRIAN
               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't
               make a lamp?

                            BENDER
               No, you're a genius because you
               can't make a lamp...

                            BRIAN
               What do you know about Trigonometry?

                            BENDER
               I could care less about
               Trigonometry...

                            BRIAN
               Bender, did you know without
               Trigonometry there'd be no
               engineering?

                            BENDER
               Without lamps, there'd be no light!

                            CLAIRE
              Okay so neither one of you is any
               better than the other one...

     Allison feels left out.

                           ALLISON
               I can write with my toes!  I can
               also eat, brush my teeth...

                            CLAIRE
               With your feet?

                           ALLISON
               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.

                            BRIAN
               I can make spaghetti!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               What can you do?

                            ANDREW
               I can...uh...tape all your buns
               together...

                            BENDER
               I wanna see what Claire can do!

                            CLAIRE
               I can't do anything.

                            BENDER
               Now, everybody can do something...

                            CLAIRE
               There's one thing I can do, no
               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.

                            BENDER
               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean
               that guy's been doing that show for
               thirty years.

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, but you have to swear to God
               you won't laugh...I can't believe
               I'm actually doing this...

     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it
     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.

     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.

      Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.

                            ANDREW
               All right, great!  Where'd you learn
               to do that?

                            CLAIRE
               Camp, seventh grade...

                            BENDER
               That was great, Claire...my image of
               you is totally blown...

                           ALLISON
               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her
               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!

                            BENDER
               Am I laughing?

                            ANDREW
               You fucking prick!

     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his
     words hitting home.

                            BENDER
               What do you care what I think,
               anyway?  I don't even count, right?
               I could disappear forever and it
               wouldn't make any difference...I may
               as well not even exist at this
               school, remember?
                    (he turns to Claire)
               And you...don't like me anyway!

                            CLAIRE
               You know, I have just as many
               feelings as you do and it hurts
               just as much when somebody steps
               all over them!

                            BENDER
               God, you're so pathetic!
                    (furious)
               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare
               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got
               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'
               Rapunzel, right?  School would
               probably fucking shut down if you
               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't
               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.

                            CLAIRE
                    (quietly)
               Shut up...

                            BENDER
               Are those real diamonds, Claire?

                            CLAIRE
                    (angry)
               Shut up!

                    BENDER                       CLAIRE
          I bet they are...did you
          work, for the money               Shut...
          for those earrings?                   Your mouth!

                            BENDER
               Or did your daddy buy those?

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious)
               Shut up!

     Claire starts crying.

                            BENDER
               I bet he bought those for you!  I
               bet those are a Christmas gift!
               Right?  You know what I got for
               Christmas this year?  It was a
               banner fuckin' year at the old
               Bender family!  I got a carton of
               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me
               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"
               Okay, so go home'n cry to your
               daddy, don't cry here, okay?

     There are a few beats.

                            ANDREW
               My God, are we gonna be like our
               parents?

                            CLAIRE
               Not me...ever...

                           ALLISON
               It's unavoidable, it just happens.

                            CLAIRE
               What happens?

                           ALLISON
               When you grow up, your heart dies.

                            BENDER
               Who cares?

     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.

                           ALLISON
               I care...

                            BRIAN
               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I
               know it's kind of a weird time, but
               I was just wondering, um, what is
               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When
               we're all together again?  I mean I
               consider you guys my friends, I'm
               not wrong, am I?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BRIAN
               So, so on Monday...what happens?

                            CLAIRE
               Are we still friends, you mean?
               If we're friends now, that is?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah...

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want the truth?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I want the truth...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't think so...

                           ALLISON
               Well, do you mean all of us or just
               John?

                            CLAIRE
               With all of you...

                            ANDREW
               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!

                            CLAIRE
               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came
               walking up to you in the hall on
               Monday, what would you do?  I mean
               picture this, you're there with all
               the sports.  I know exactly what
               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up
               so your friends wouldn't think you
               really liked him!

                            ANDREW
               No way!

                           ALLISON
               'Kay, what if I came up to you?

                            CLAIRE
               Same exact thing!

                            BENDER
                    (furious and screaming at Claire)
               You are a bitch!

                            CLAIRE
               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,
               that makes me a bitch?

                            BENDER
               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that
               is to do to someone!  And you don't
               got the balls to stand up to your
               friends and tell 'em that you're
               gonna like who you wanna like!

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
               Why don't you take Allison to one of
               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or
               take Brian out to the parking lot at
               lunch to get high?  What about Andy
               for that matter, what about me?
               What would your friends say if we
               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
               doing it with me so they'd forgive
               you for being seen with me.

                            BENDER
                    (furious once again)
               Don't you ever talk about my
               friends!  You don't know any of my
               friends, you don't look at any of my
               friends and you certainly wouldn't
               condescend to speak to any of my
               friends so you just stick to the
               things you know, shopping, nail
               polish, your father's BMW and your
               poor--rich--drunk mother in the
               Carribean!

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious and sobbing)
               Shut up!

                            BENDER
               And as far as being concerned about
               what's gonna happen when you and I
               walk down the hallways at school,
               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never
               gonna happen!  Just bury your head
               in the sand...and wait for your
               fuckin' prom!

                            CLAIRE
               I hate you!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?  Good!

     There is silence until Brian speaks.

                            BRIAN
               Then I assume Allison and I are
               better people than you guys, huh?
               Us weirdos...
                    (to Allison)
               Do you, would you do that to me?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have any friends...

                            BRIAN
               Well if you did?

                           ALLISON
               No...I don't think the kind of
               friends I'd have would mind...

                            BRIAN
               I just wanna tell, each of you,
               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't
               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's
               real shitty...

                            CLAIRE
               Your friends wouldn't mind because
               they look up to us...

     Brian laughs at her.

                            BRIAN
               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're
               so conceited.  You're so, like, full
               of yourself, why are you like that?

                            CLAIRE
                    (crying again)
               I'm not saying that to be conceited!
               I hate it!  I hate having to go
               along with everything my friends say!

                            BRIAN
               Well then why do you do it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, I don't...you don't
               understand..you don't.  You're not
               friends with the same kind of people
               that Andy and I are friends with!
               You know, you just don't understand
               the pressure that they can put on
               you!

     Brian is shocked.

                            BRIAN
               I don't understand what?  You think
               I don't understand pressure, Claire?
               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!

     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.

                            BRIAN
               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?
               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a
               gun in the locker...

                            ANDREW
               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

                            BRIAN
               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk
               on it and the light's s'posed to go
               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,
               I...

                            ANDREW
               What's the gun for Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You brought it up, man!

                            BRIAN
               I can't have an F, I can't have it
               and I know my parents can't have it!
               Even if I aced the rest of the
               semester, I'm still only a B.  And
               everything's ruined for me!

                            CLAIRE
                    (with pity)
               Oh Brian...

     Brian bashes a chair over.

                            BRIAN
               So I considered my options, you
               know?

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Killing yourself is not an
               option!

                            BRIAN
               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I
               don't think so!

                           ALLISON
               It was a hand gun?

                            BRIAN
               No, it was a flare gun, went off
               in my locker.

                            ANDREW
               Really?

     Andrew starts to laugh.

                            BRIAN
               It's not funny...

     They all start to laugh, including Brian.

                            BRIAN
               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was
               destroyed!

                           ALLISON
               You wanna know what I did to get in
               here?  Nothing...I didn't have
               anything better to do.

     Everyone laughs.

                           ALLISON
               You're laughing at me...

                            ANDREW
               No!

     Allison starts to laugh too.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah you are!
                                                  CUT TO:

31. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     We see Brian putting a record on and then music starts.

     We see them all dancing.  This goes on for the duration
     of the song.
                                                  CUT TO:

32. INT. HEATING DUCT - DAY

     We see Bender crawling back through the heating duct.
                                                  CUT TO:

33. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that
     order on the railing.

                            CLAIRE
               Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah?

                            CLAIRE
               Are you gonna write your paper?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, why?

                            CLAIRE
               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of
               us to write our paper, don't you
               think?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us
               to do...

                            CLAIRE
               True, but I think we'd all kinda
               say the same thing.

                            BRIAN
               You just don't want to write your
               paper...Right?

                            CLAIRE
               True, but, you're the smartest,
               right?

                            BRIAN
                    (with pride)
               Oh, well...

                            CLAIRE
               We trust you...

     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in
     approval.

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

                            BRIAN
               All right, I'll do it...

                            CLAIRE
               Great...

     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Allison)
               Come on...

                           ALLISON
               Where're we going?

                            CLAIRE
               Come on!

     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.

                            CLAIRE
               Don't be afraid.

                           ALLISON
               Don't stick that in my eye!

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not sticking it, just close...
               just go like that...

     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.

                            CLAIRE
               Good...

     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.

                            CLAIRE
               You know you really do look a lot
               better without all that black shit
               on your eyes...

                           ALLISON
               Hey...I like that black shit...

                            CLAIRE
               This looks a lot better...look up.

     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.

     We see Andrew just thinking.

     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still
     putting make-up on Allison.

                           ALLISON
               Please, why're you being so nice to
               me?

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause you're letting me.

     We see Brian begin to write.

     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     We see Bender, in the closet once again.  Claire opens
     the door and enters.

                            BENDER
               You lost?

     Claire stares at him.

     Bender smiles.

     Brian is busily preparing the essay.

     Andrew looks up and sees the newly made over Allison
     and is in awe.

     Allison walks towards him and stops when she notices
     Brian staring at her with his mouth open.

     She glares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Cool!

                           ALLISON

     Claire kisses Bender, then she breaks the kiss.

               Why'd you do that?

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

                            BENDER
               You know how you said before, how
               your parents used you to get back
               at each other...wouldn't I be
               outstanding in that capacity?

                            CLAIRE
               Were you really disgusted about
               what I did with my lipstick?

                            CLAIRE
               Truth...

               What happened to you?

                           ALLISON
        Why?  Claire did it!  What's wrong?

                            ANDREW
               Nothing's wrong, it's just so
               different.  I can see your face.

                           ALLISON
               Is that good or bad?

                            ANDREW

               Saturday in detention for whatever
               it was we did wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make an essay

               convenient definitions.

               I can't believe you can't get me
               out of this...I mean it's so absurd
               I have to be here on a Saturday!

               time we do this?

               Mom, we're not supposed to study; we
               just have to sit there and do
               nothing.

                        BRIAN'S MOTHER
               Well mister you figure out a way to

               Hey, I screwed around...guys screw
               around, there's nothing wrong with
               that.  Except you got caught, Sport.

     We see JOHN BENDER walking towards us.  He is wearing
     sunglasses.  A car is coming towards him but he doesn't
     stop walking.

     The car slams on its breaks directly in front of him.

     Bender gets out of the frame.  Out of the car steps
     ALLISON.  She is dressed all in black.  She steps
     forward to look in the car's front window and the car
     drives away.

6. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     There are six tables in two rows of three.
     Claire is sitting at the front table.  Brian comes in
     and sits at the table behind her.

     Andrew comes in and points at the chair next to Claire
     at the front table.  She shrugs and he sits there.

     In walks Bender, he touches everything on the checkout
     desk and takes a few things in the process.

     He walks over to where Brian is sitting and points to
     the table on the opposite side of the Library.  Brian
     reluctantly gets up and moves.

     Bender sits at the table where Brian was and puts his
     feet up.

     Allison walks in.  She walks all the way around the
     library and sits in the back corner table, just behind
     Brian.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and snicker.

     Brian looks at her in confusion and then turns away.

     Enter RICHARD VERNON, a teacher.  He holds a stack
     of papers in his left hand.  He addresses the group with
     such disrespect it makes you wonder how he ever got the
     job.

                            VERNON
               Well...well.  Here we are!  I want
               to congradulate you for being on
               time...

     Claire raises her hand.

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir?  I think there's
               been a mistake.  I know it's
               detention, but...um...I don't think
               I belong in here...

     Vernon doesn't care.  He just continues to talk.

                            VERNON
               It is now seven-oh-six.  You have
               exactly eight hours and fifty-four
               minutes to think about why you're
               here.  To ponder the error of your
               ways...

     Bender spits into the air and catches the spit in his
     mouth again.

     Claire looks like she is going to gag.

                            VERNON
               ...and you may not talk.  You will
               not move from these seats.

     He glances up at Bender and points at him.

                            VERNON
               ...and you...

     Vernon pulls the chair out from under Bender's feet.

                            VERNON
               ...will not sleep.  Alright people,
               we're gonna try something a little
               different today.  We are going to
               write an essay--of no less than a
               thousand words--describing to me
               who you think you are.

                            BENDER
               Is this a test?

     Vernon passes out paper and pencils and takes no notice
     of Bender.

                            VERNON
               And when I say essay...I mean essay.
               I do not mean a single word repeated
               a thousand times.  Is that clear Mr.
               Bender?

     Bender looks up.

                            BENDER
               Crystal...

                            VERNON
               Good.  Maybe you'll learn a little
               something about yourself.  Maybe
               you'll even--decide whether or not
               you care to return.

     Brian raises his hand and then stands.

                            BRIAN
               You know, I can answer that right
               now sir...That'd be "No", no for me.
               'cause...

                            VERNON
               Sit down Johnson...

                            BRIAN
               Thank you sir...

     He sits.

                            VERNON
               My office...

     Vernon points.

                            VERNON
               ...is right across that hall.  Any
               monkey business is ill-advised...

     He looks around at them.

                            VERNON
               ...any questions?

                            BENDER
               Yeah...I got a question.

     Vernon looks at him suspiciously.

                            BENDER
               Does Barry Manilow know you raid his
               wardrobe?

                            VERNON
               I'll give you the answer to that
               question, Mr. Bender, next Saturday.
               Don't mess with the bull young man,
               you'll get the horns.

     Vernon leaves.

                            BENDER
               That man...is a brownie hound...

     Everyone tries to get comfortable and we hear a loud
     snapping sound.  Brian turns and looks and it is
     Allison, biting her nails.

     Bender's eyes widen as he turns to look.  Everyone is
     looking now.  Allison notices them looking at her.

                            BENDER
               You keep eating your hand and you're
               not gonna be hungry for lunch...

     Allison spits part of her nail at Bender.

                            BENDER
               I've seen you before, you know...

     We see Vernon look out from his office.

     We see Brian playing with his pen.

                            BRIAN
                    (quietly to himself)
               Who do I think I am?  Who are you?
               Who are you?

     He attaches the pen to his bottom lip and puts the top
     under his upper lip.

                            BRIAN
               I am a walrus...

     Bender looks at him in utter confusion.  Brian notices
     this, laughs and takes the pen out of his mouth--
     embarrassed.

     Bender and Brian begin to take their jackets off at the
     same time.  They both notice this.  Brian stops removing
     his jacket.

     Bender takes his all the way off.  Brian rubs his hands
     together and pretends to be cold.  He pulls his jacket
     back on.  He turns and looks at Bender who is still
     staring at him.

                            BRIAN
               It's the shits, huh?

     Bender glares at him and Brian utters an uncomfortable
     laugh.

     Bender turns away and crumples up his essay paper.  He
     throws it at Claire.  It misses and goes over Claire's
     head.

     Andrew and Claire acknowlege it but continue to ignore
     Bender.

     Bender starts loudly "singing" the musical part of a
     song.  Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah...nah, nah, nah...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to herself)
               I can't believe this is really
               happening to me...

     Bender stops "singing" abruptly.

                            BENDER
               Oh, shit!  What're we s'posed to do
               if we hafta take a piss?

                            CLAIRE
                    (disgusted)
               Please...

                            BENDER
               If you gotta go...

     We hear Bender unzip his fly.

                            BENDER
               You gotta go!

     Everyone is now looking at Bender.

                            CLAIRE
                   (disgusted)
               Oh my God!

                            ANDREW
               Hey, yer not urinating in here man!

                            BENDER
               Don't talk!  Don't talk!  It makes
               it crawl back up!

                            ANDREW
               You whip it out and you're dead
               before the first drop hits the
               floor!

     Bender gasps mockingly.

                            BENDER
               You're pretty sexy when you get
               angry...grrr!

     He turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Hey, homeboy...

     Brian points at himself with his pen.

                            BENDER
              ...why don't you go close that door.
               We'll get the prom queen--
               impregnated!

     Claire turns and glares at him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!

     Bender ignores him.

                            ANDREW
               Hey!
                          BENDER
               What?

                            ANDREW
               If I lose my temper, you're totalled
               man!

                            BENDER
               Totally?

                            ANDREW
               Totally!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Why don't you just shut up!  Nobody
               here is interested!

                            ANDREW
               Really!
                    (to Claire about Bender)
               Buttface!

                            BENDER
               Well hey Sporto!  What'd you do to
               get in here?  Forget to wash your
               jock?

                            BRIAN
                    (nervous)
               Uh, excuse me, fellas?  I think we
               should just write our papers...

                            ANDREW
                    (to Bender)
               Look, just because you live in here
               doesn't give you the right to be a
               pain in the ass...so knock it off!

     Bender mockingly registers pain in his face.

                            BENDER
               It's a free country...

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               He's just doing it to get a rise out
               of you!  Just ignore him...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Sweets...you couldn't ignore me if
               you tried!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                           BENDER
               So...so!
                    (to Andrew and Claire)
               Are you guys like boyfriend/girl-
               friend?
                    (a beat)
               Steady dates?
                    (another beat)
               Lo--vers?
                    (another beat)
               Come on Sporto, level with me.  Do
               you slip her the hot...beef...
               injection?

     Claire and Andrew turn to face Bender, both furious.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screams)
               Go to hell!

                            ANDREW
                    (screams)
               Enough!

                                                  CUT TO:

7. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     We see Vernon in his office.

                            VERNON
                    (yells)
               Hey!  What's going on in there?
                    (to himself)
               Smug little pricks!
                                                  CUT TO:

8. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They all look at each other.  Andrew turns away from
     Bender.

                            ANDREW
                    (to himself)
               Scumbag!

     Bender stands up and walks over to the railing.  He sits
     on it.

                            BENDER
               What do you say we close that door.
               We can't have any kind of party
               with Vernon checking us out every
               few seconds.

                            BRIAN
               Well, you know the door's s'posed to
               stay open...

                           BENDER
               So what?

                           ANDREW
               So why don't you just shut up!
               There's four other people in here
               you know...

                            BENDER
               God, you can count.  See!  I knew
               you had to be smart to be a...a
               wrestler.

                            ANDREW
               Who the hell are you to judge
               anybody anyway?

                            CLAIRE
               Really...

                            ANDREW
               You know, Bender...you don't even
               count.  I mean if you disappeared
               forever it wouldn't make any
               difference.  You may as well not
               even exist at this school.

     Bender probably is upset at this and he pauses a moment
     before speaking.  He doesn't let his emotions out,
     however.

                            BENDER
               Well...I'll just run right out and
               join the wrestling team.

     Andrew and Claire look at each other and laugh at
     Bender.

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               Maybe the prep club too!  Student
               council...

                            ANDREW
               No, they wouldn't take you.

                            BENDER
               I'm hurt.

                            CLAIRE
               You know why guys like you knock
               everything...

                            BENDER
                    (to himself)
               Oh, this should be stunning...

                            CLAIRE
               It's 'cause you're afraid.

                            BENDER
                    (with mock enthusiasm)
               Oh, God!  You ritchies are so smart,
               that's exactly why I'm not heavy in
               activities!

                            CLAIRE
               You're a big coward!

     Brian feels left out.

                            BRIAN
                    (to no one imparticular)
               I'm in the math club...

                            CLAIRE
               See you're afraid that they won't
               take you.  You don't belong so you
               just have to dump all over it...

                            BENDER
               Well...it wouldn't have anything to
               do with you activities people being
               assholes...now would it?

                            CLAIRE
               Well you wouldn't know...You don't
               even know any of us.

                            BENDER
               Well, I don't know any lepers
               either, but I'm not gonna run out
               and join one of their fucking clubs.

                            ANDREW
               Hey let's watch the mouth, huh?

     Brian again feels he needs to contribute.

                            BRIAN
               I'm in the physics club too...

                            BENDER
                    (to Claire)
               S'cuse me a sec...
                    (to Brian)
               What are you babbling about?

                            BRIAN
               Well, what I said was...I'm in the
               math club, the Latin club and the
               physics club...physics club.

     Bender nods and turns to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Hey...Cherry...do you belong to the
               physics club?

                            CLAIRE
               That's an academic club...

                            BENDER
               So?

                            CLAIRE
               So...academic clubs aren't the same
               as other kinds of clubs.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but to dorks like him...

     Bender points at Brian.

                            BENDER
               ...they are.
                    (to Brian)
               What do you guys do in your club?

                            BRIAN
               In physics, um, we ah, we talk about
               physics...about properties of physics.

                            BENDER
               So it's sorta social...demented and
               sad, but social.  Right?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, well, I guess you could
               consider it a social situation.  I
               mean there are other children in my
               club and uh, at the end of the year
               we have, um, you know, a big
               banquet, at the, uh, at the Hilton.

                            BENDER
               You load up, you party...

                            BRIAN
               Well, no, we get dressed up...I
               mean, but, we don't...we don't get
               high.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               Only burners like you get high...

                            BRIAN
               And, uh, I didn't have any shoes.
               So I had to borrow my dad's.  It
               was kinda weird 'cause my mom doesn't
               like me to wear other people's
               shoes.  And, uh, my cousin Kent...my
               cousin Kendall from, uh, Indiana...
               He got high once and you know, he
               started eating like really weird
               foods.  And uh, and then he just
               felt like he didn't belong anywhere.
               You know, kinda like, you know
               "Twilight Zone" kinda.

                            CLAIRE
                    (laughs)
                    (to Bender)
               Sounds like you...

                            ANDREW
               Look, you guys keep up your talking
               and Vernon's gonna come right in
               here...I got a meet this Saturday
               and I'm not gonna miss it on account
               of you boneheads...

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               Oh and wouldn't that be a bite...

     Bender lets out a moan of fake agony.

                            BENDER
               Missing a whole wrestling meet!

                            ANDREW
               Well you wouldn't know anything
               about it, faggot!  You never competed
               in your whole life!

                            BENDER
                    (with mock hurt)
               Oh, I know...I feel all empty inside
               because of it.  I have such a deep
               admiration for guys that roll around
               on the floor with other guys!

                            ANDREW
               Ahhh...you'd never miss it.  You
               don't have any goals.

                            BENDER
               Oh, but I do!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah?

                            BENDER
               I wanna be just--like--you!  I
               figure all I need's a labotamy and
               some tights!

     Brian becomes interested.

                            BRIAN
               You wear tights?

                            ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               No I don't wear tights, I wear the
               required uniform...

                            BRIAN
               Tights...

                            ANDREW
                    (defensive)
               Shut up!

     They hear Vernon moving around out in the hall so Bender
     quickly comes and sits in the chair between Claire and
     Andrew.  He folds his hands on the table.
     Vernon goes back into his office.  Bender laughs and
     gets up.  He starts walking towards the double doors
     that separate the library from the hallway.

                            BRIAN
               You know there's not s'posed to be
               any monkey business!

     Bender turns and points at Brian.

                            BENDER
                    (in a stern voice)
               Young man...have you finished your
               paper?

     Bender turns back away and goes to the door.  He looks
     around cautiously and removes a screw from the door.

                            CLAIRE
               What are you gonna do?

                            ANDREW
               Drop dead, I hope!
                                                  CUT TO:

9. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon getting a drink at the fountain. He stands
     up and checks the way he looks in a mirror.  He does a
     muscular pose and utters some manly jibberish Cobadonga!
                                                  CUT TO:

10. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Brian looks up.  Bender is messing with the door to the
     library.

                            BRIAN
               Bender, that's, that's school
               property there...you know, it doesn't
               belong to us.  It's something not to
               be toyed with.

     The door slams shut.  Bender runs back to his seat.

                            ANDREW
               That's very funny, come on, fix it!

                            BRIAN
               You should really fix that!

                            BENDER
               Am I a genius?

                            ANDREW
               No, you're an asshole!

                            BENDER
               What a funny guy!

                            ANDREW
               Fix the door Bender!

                            BENDER
               Everyone just shhh!
                                                  CUT TO:

11. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     We see Vernon walking back to his office.  He stops and
     listens to them through the closed door.

                         BENDER (OS)
               I've been here before, I know what
               I'm doing!

                         ANDREW (OS)
               No!  Fix the door, get up there and
               fix it!

                         BENDER (OS)
                    (screams)
               Shut up!
                                                  CUT TO:

12. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Brian as we hear Vernon in the hall.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     He opens the door and storms in.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

     For a few seconds no one says anything, they just stare
     at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               Why is that door closed?

                            BENDER
               How're we s'posed to know?  We're
               not s'posed to move, right?

     Vernon turns to Claire.

                            VERNON
               Why?

                            CLAIRE
               We were just sitting here, like we
               were s'posed to...

     Vernon looks around and looks at Bender.

                            VERNON
               Who closed that door?

                            BENDER
               I think a screw fell out of it...

                            ANDREW
               It just closed, sir...

     Vernon looks at Allison in the back.

                            VERNON
               Who?

     Allison lets out a squeak and slams her face onto the
     table, hiding in her jacket hood.

                            BENDER
               She doesn't talk, sir...

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Give me that screw...

                            BENDER
              I don't have it...

                            VERNON
               You want me to yank you outta that
               seat and shake it out of you?

                            BENDER
               I don't have it...screws fall out
               all of the time, the world's an
               imperfect place...

                            VERNON
               Give it to me, Bender...

                            CLAIRE
               Excuse me, sir, why would anybody
               want to steal a screw?

                            VERNON
                    (to Claire)
               Watch it, young lady...

     Vernon goes over to the door.  He tries to hold it open
     by putting a folding chair in front of it.

                            BENDER
               The door's way too heavy, sir.

     The door slams shut despite the chair.

                         VERNON (OS)
               God damnit!

     They laugh.

     Vernon opens the door again.  He comes back in.

                            VERNON
                    (pointing)
               Andrew Clark...get up here.  Come on,
               front and center, let's go.

     Andrew gets up and walks over to Vernon.

                            BENDER
               Hey, how come Andrew gets to get up?
               If he gets up, we'll all get up,
               it'll be anarchy!

     Vernon and Andrew are now attempting to move the steel
     magazine rack in front of the door.

                            VERNON
              Okay, now, watch the magazines!

                            BENDER
               It's out of my hands...

     They get it into the doorway and it blocks the entire
     door.

                            BENDER
               That's very clever sir, but what if
               there's a fire?  I think violating
               fire codes and endangering the
               lives of children would be unwise
               at this juncture in your career, sir.

     Vernon thinks about it.  He turns to Andrew.

                            VERNON
               Alright, what are you doing with
               this?  Get this outta here for God's
               sake!  What's the matter with you?
               Come on!

                            BRIAN
               You know the school comes equipped
               with fire exits at either end of the
               library.

     Brian points at them and Bender glares at him.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               Show Dick some respect!

     Andrew and Vernon come back into the main section of
     the library.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               Let's go...go!  Get back into your
               seat.

     Andrew sits.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               I expected a little more from a
               varsity letterman!
                    (to Bender)
               You're not fooling anybody, Bender!
               The next screw that falls out is
               gonna be you!

     Vernon turns to leave.

                            BENDER
                    (under his breath)
               Eat my shorts...

     Vernon spins in his tracks and faces Bender again.

                            VERNON
               What was that?

                            BENDER
                    (loudly)
               Eat my shorts!

                            VERNON
               You just bought yourself another
               Saturday, mister!

                            BENDER
               Oh, Christ...

                            VERNON
               You just bought one more right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Well, I'm free the Saturday after
               that...beyond that, I'm gonna have
               to check my calendar!

                            VERNON
               Good!  'Cause it's gonna be filled,
               we'll keep goin'!  You want another
               one?  Say the word, just say the
               word!  Instead of going to prison,
               you'll come here!  Are you through.

                            BENDER
               No!

                            VERNON
               I'm doing society a favor!

                            BENDER
               So?

                            VERNON
               That's another one, right now!  I've
               got you for the rest of your natural
               born life if you don't watch your
               step!  You want another one?

                            BENDER
               Yes!

                            VERNON
               You got it!  You got another one,
               right there!  That's another one
               pal!

                            CLAIRE
                    (worried)
               Cut it out!

     Claire mouths the word "Stop" to Bender.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               Not even close, bud!

                            VERNON
               Good!  You got one more, right
               there!

                            BENDER
               Do you really think I give a shit?

                            VERNON
               Another...

     Bender glares at him.

                            VERNON
               You through?

                            BENDER
               How many is that?

                            BRIAN
               That's seven including the one when
               we first came in and you asked Mr.
               Vernon here whether Barry Manilow
               knew that he raided his closet.

                            VERNON
                    (to Bender)
               Now it's eight...
                    (to Brian)
               You stay out of it!

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me, sir, it's seven!

                            VERNON
               Shut up, Peewee!
                    (to Bender)
               You're mine Bender...for two months
               I gotcha!  I gotcha!

                            BENDER
               What can I say?  I'm thrilled!

                            VERNON
               Oh, I'm sure that's exactly what you
               want these people to believe.  You
               know something, Bender?  You ought
               to spend a little more time trying
               to do something with yourself and a
               little less time trying to impress
               people.  You might be better off.
                    (to everyone)
               Alright, that's it!  I'm going to
               be right outside those doors.  The
               next time I hafta come in here...I'm
               cracking skulls!  (Bender mouths Im
               cracking skulls)

     Vernon leaves and closes the door.  A musical riff
     builds to a climax as Bender screams.

                            BENDER
                    (screams)
               Fuck you!

     We see the clock, it reads a quarter to eight.

     We see Bender, lighting his shoe on fire and lighting a
     cigarette with his shoe.

     We see Claire thinking.

     We see Brian playing with his balls.

     We see Andrew playing with his sweatshirt.

     We see Allison pulling a string around her finger and
     making it turn purple.

     We see Bender put the flames on his shoe out.  He then
     plays air guitar.

     We see Allison drawing.

     We see Andrew playing paper football.  He cheers
     silently.

     Allison shakes dandruff from her hair onto her picture.

     We see everyone fall asleep.

     Later.

     Vernon is standing there staring at the sleeping kids.

                            VERNON
               Wake up!  Who has to go to the
               lavatory?

     Everyone raises their hands.
                                                  CUT TO:

14. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     We see the clock, it now says 10:22.

     We see Andrew stretching.  We see Bender tearing pages
     out of a book.  He is tossing them around.

                            ANDREW
               That's real intelligent.

                            BENDER
               You're right...it's wrong to
               destroy literature...

     He continues to tear pages out.

                            BENDER
               It's such fun to read...and, Molet
               really pumps my nads!

                            CLAIRE
                    (pronouncing it correctly)
               Mol-yare.

                            BRIAN
              I love his work.

     Bender tosses the rest of the pages at Brian.  He picks
     up the card catalogue drawer and begins to take cards
     out.

                            BENDER
               Big deal...nothing to do when you're
               locked in a vacancy..

                           ANDREW
               Speak for yourself...

                            BENDER
               Do you think I'd speak for you?  I
               don't even know your language!

     Andrew turns to Claire.

                            ANDREW
               Hey, you grounded tonight?

     Claire shrugs.

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, my mom said I was but
               by dad told me to just blow her off.

                            ANDREW
               Big party at Stubbies, parents are
               in Europe.  Should be pretty wild...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah, can you go?

                            CLAIRE
               I doubt it...

                            ANDREW
               How come?

                            CLAIRE
               Well 'cause if I do what my mother
               tells me not to do, it's because
               because my father says it's okay.
               There's like this whole big monster
               deal, it's endless and it's a total
               drag.  It's like any minute...
               divorce...

                            BENDER
               Who do you like better?

                            CLAIRE
               What?

                            BENDER
               You like your old man better than
               your mom?

                            CLAIRE
               They're both strict.

                            BENDER
               No, I mean, if you had to choose
               between them.

                            CLAIRE
               I dunno, I'd probably go live with
               my brother.  I mean, I don't think
               either one of them gives a shit
               about me...it's like they use me
               just to get back at each other.

     Suddenly, from the back of the room.  Allison speaks.

                           ALLISON
                    (loudly)
               Ha!!!

     Everyone looks at her shocked.  Allison blows her hair
     out of her eyes and grins.

                            CLAIRE
               Shut up!

                            ANDREW
               You're just feeling sorry for
               yourself...

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah, well if I didn't nobody else
               would.

                            ANDREW
               Aw...you're breaking my heart...

                            BENDER
               Sporto...

                            ANDREW
               What?

     Bender jumps down and goes next to Andrew.

                            BENDER
               You get along with your parents?

                            ANDREW
               Well if I say yes, I'm an idiot,
               right?

                            BENDER
               You're an idiot anyway...But if you
               say you get along with your parents
               well you're a liar too!

     Bender turns and walks away from him.  Andrew follows
     and pushes Bender.

                            ANDREW
               You know something, man...If we
               weren't in school right now, I'd
               waste you!

     Bender points his middle finger at the floor.

                            BENDER
               Can you hear this?  Want me to turn
               it up?

     Bender flips his hand around so he is now giving Andrew
     the bird.

     Brian comes over and puts a hand on each of the guy's
     shoulders.

                            BRIAN
               Hey fellas, I mean...

     Andrew pushes away from Brian.

                            BRIAN
               ...I don't like my parents either,
               I don't...I don't get along with
               them...their idea of parental
               compassion is just, you know, wacko!

     Bender turns to Brian.

                            BENDER
               Dork...

                            BRIAN
              Yeah?

                            BENDER
               You are a parent's wet dream, okay?

     Bender starts to walk away.

                            BRIAN
               Well that's a problem!

                            BENDER
               Look, I can see you getting all
               bunged up for them making you wear
               these kinda clothes.  But face it,
               you're a Neo-Maxi-Zoom-Dweebie!
               What would you be doing if you
               weren't out making yourself a better
               citizen?

                            ANDREW
               Why do you have to insult everybody?

                            BENDER
               I'm being honest, asshole!  I would
               expect you...to know the difference!

                            ANDREW
               Yeah well, he's gotta name!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah,
                    (to Brian)
               What's your name?

                            BRIAN
               Brian...

                            ANDREW
               See...

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               My condolences...

     Bender walks away.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               What's your name?

                            BENDER
               What's yours?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...

                            BENDER
               Ka-Laire?

                            CLAIRE
               Claire...it's a family name!

                            BENDER
               Nooo...It's a fat girl's name!

                            CLAIRE
               Well thank you...

                            BENDER
               You're welcome...

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not fat!

                            BENDER
               Well not at present but I could see
               you really pushing maximum density!
               You see, I'm not sure if you know
               this...but there are two kinds of
               fat people.  There's fat people that
               were born to be fat, and then there's
               fat people that were once thin but
               they became fat...so when you look
               at them you can sorta see that thin
               person inside!  You see, you're
               gonna get married, you're gonna
               squeeze out a few puppies and then,
               uh...

     He mimes becoming fat, making noises.

     Claire gives him the finger.

                            BENDER
               Oh...obscene finger gestures from
               such a pristine girl!

                            CLAIRE
                    (resentfully)
               I'm not that pristine!

     Bender bends down closer to Claire.

                            BENDER
               Are you a virgin?
                    (a beat)
               I'll bet you a million dollars that
               you are!  Let's end the suspense!
               Is it gonna be...
                    (another beat)
               ...a white weddin?

                            CLAIRE
               Why don't you just shut up?

                            BENDER
               Have you ever kissed a boy on the
               mouth?
                    (a beat)
               Have you ever been felt up?  Over
               the bra, under the blouse, shoes
               off...hoping to God your parents
               don't walk in?

     Claire is getting upset.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want me to puke?

                            BENDER
               Over the panties, no bra, blouse
               unbuttoned, Calvin's in a ball on
               the front seat past eleven on a
               school night?

                            ANDREW
               Leave her alone!

     Bender slowly stands and faces Andrew.

                            ANDREW
               I said leave her alone!

                            BENDER
               You gonna make me?

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

     Bender walks over to where Andrew is standing.

                            BENDER
               You and how many of your friends?

                            ANDREW
               Just me, just you and me.  Two hits.
               Me hitting you, you hitting the
               floor!  Anytime you're ready, pal!

     Bender goes to hit him but Andrew gets Bender down on
     the ground with a wrestling move.

                            BENDER
               I don't wanna get into to this with
               you man...

     Andrew gets up.

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

     Bender gets up.

                            BENDER
               'Cause I'd kill you...It's real simple.
               I'd kill you and your fucking parents
               would sue me and it would be a big
               mess and I don't care enough about
               you to bother.

                            ANDREW
               Chicken shit...

     Andrew turns and walks away.  Bender takes out a
     switchblade and opens it.

     He stabs the switchblade into a chair.

                            ANDREW
               Let's end this right now.  You don't
               talk to her...you don't look at her
               and you don't even think about her!
               You understand me?

                            BENDER
               I'm trying to help her!.

     We see the janitor, CARL come into the room.

                             CARL
               Brian, how you doing?

                            BENDER
               Your dad works here?

     Brian is embarrassed.

                            BENDER
               Uh, Carl?

                             CARL
               What?

                            BENDER
               Can I ask you a question?

                             CARL
               Sure...

                            BENDER
               How does one become a janitor?

                             CARL
               You wanna be a janitor?

                            BENDER
               No I just wanna know how one becomes
               a janitor because Andrew here, is
               very interested in persuing a
               career in the custodial arts...

                             CARL
               Oh, really?  You guys think I'm
               just some untouchable peasant?  Peon?
               Huh?  Maybe so, but following
               a broom around after shitheads like
               you for the past eight years I've
               learned a couple of things...I look
               through your letters, I look through
               your lockers...I listen to your
               conversations, you don't know that
               but I do...I am the eyes and ears of
               this institution my friends.  By the
               way, that clock's twenty minutes
               fast!

     Everyone groans.  Bender smiles.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!
                                                  CUT TO:

15. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     The clock says 11:30.  Vernon gets up and leaves.
                                                  CUT TO:

16. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Bender starts to whistle a marching tune and everybody
     joins in.

     Vernon enters.  Bender begins to whistle Beethoven's
     5th.

                            VERNON
               Allright girls, that's thirty
               minutes for lunch...

                            ANDREW
               Here?

                            VERNON
               Here...

                            ANDREW
               Well I think the cafeteria would be
               a more suitable place for us to eat
               lunch in, sir!

                            VERNON
               Well, I don't care what you think,
               Andrew!

                            BENDER
               Uh, Dick?  Excuse me, Rich...will
               milk be made available to us?

                            ANDREW
               We're extremely thirsty sir...

                            CLAIRE
               I have a very low tolerance for
               dehydration.

                            ANDREW
               I've seen her dehydrate sir, it's
               pretty gross.

     Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Relax, I'll get it!

                            VERNON
               Ah, ah, ah grab some wood there, bub!

     Bender grins.

                            VERNON
               What do you think, I was born
               yesterday?  You think I'm gonna
               have you roaming these halls?

     He points at Andrew.

                            VERNON
               You!

     He points at Allison.

                            VERNON
               And you!  Hey!  What's her name?
               Wake her!  Wake her up!
                    (to Allison)
               Come on, on your feet missy!  Let's
               go!  This is no rest home!

     Allison gets up.

                            VERNON
               There's a soft drink machine in the
               teacher's lounge.  Lets go!

16. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Andrew and Allison are walking in the hall.

                            ANDREW
               So, what's your poison?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               What do you drink?

     Allison still doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Okay...forget I asked...

     Allison waits for two beats and then speaks.

                           ALLISON
               Vodka...

                            ANDREW
               Vodka?  When do you drink vodka?

                           ALLISON
               Whenever...

                            ANDREW
              A lot?

     Allison smiles.

                           ALLISON
               Tons...

                            ANDREW
               Is that why you're here today?

     Allison doesn't answer.

                            ANDREW
               Why are you here?

     Allison snaps back.

                           ALLISON
               Why are you here?

     They stop walking and Andrew leans against the wall.

                            ANDREW
               Um, I'm here today...because uh,
               because my coach and my father don't
               want me to blow my ride.  See I get
               treated differently because uh,
               Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does
               my old man.  I'm not a winner
               because I wanna be one... I'm a
               winner because I got strength and
               speed.  Kinda like a race horse.
               That's about how involved I am in
               what's happening to me.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah?  That's very interesting.
               Now why don't you tell me why you're
               really in here.

                            ANDREW
               Forget it!

17. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Claire and Bender and Brian are all sitting around
     waiting for the Cokes.

                            BENDER
               Claire...you wanna see a picture of
               a guy with elephantitus of the nuts?
               It's pretty tasty...

                            CLAIRE
               No thank you...

                            BENDER
               How do you think he rides a bike?

     Claire rolls her eyes and turns away in disgust.

                            BENDER
               Oh, Claire...would you ever consider
               dating a guy like this?

                            CLAIRE
               Can't you just leave me alone?

                            BENDER
               I mean if he had a great personality
               and was a good dancer and had a cool
               car...Although you'd probably have
               to ride in the back seat 'cause his
               nuts would ride shotgun.

                            CLAIRE
               You know what I wish I was doing?

                            BENDER
               Op, watch what you say, Brian here
               is a cherry.

                            BRIAN
               A cherry?

                            CLAIRE
               I wish I was on a plane to France.

                            BRIAN
               I'm not a cherry.

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               When have you ever gotten laid?

                            BRIAN
               I've laid, lotsa times!

                            BENDER
               Name one!

                            BRIAN
               She lives in Canada, met her at
               Niagra Falls.  You wouldn't know
               her.

                            BENDER
               Ever laid anyone around here.

     Brian shushes Bender and points at Claire whos back is
     still turned.

                            BRIAN
                    Oh, you and Claire, did it!

     Claire spins around.

                            CLAIRE
              What are you talking about?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               Nothin', nothin!
                    (to Bender)
               Let's just drop it, we'll talk about
               it later!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Drop what, what're you talking
               about?

                            BENDER
               Well, Brian's trying to tell me that
               in addition to the number of girls
               in the Niagra Falls area, that
               presently you and he are, riding
               the hobby horse!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Brian)
               Little pig!

                            BRIAN
               No I'm not!  I'm not!  John said I
               was a cherry and I said I wasn't,
               that's it, that's all that was said!

                            BENDER
               Well then what were you motioning to
               Claire for?

                            CLAIRE
               You know I don't appreciate this
               very much, Brian.

                            BRIAN
               He is lying!

                            BENDER
               Oh you weren't motioning to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               You know he's lying, right?

                            BENDER
               Were you or were you not motioning
               to Claire?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, but it was only...was only
               because I didn't want her to know
               that I was a virgin, okay?

     Bender just stares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Excuse me for being a virgin, I'm
               sorry...

     Claire laughs.

                            CLAIRE
               Why didn't you want me to know you
               were a virgin?

                            BRIAN
               Because it's personal business, it's
               my personal, private business.

                            BENDER
               Well Brian, it doesn't sound like
               you're doing any business...

                            CLAIRE
               I think it's okay for a guy to be a
               virgin...

     Bender looks suprised.

                            BRIAN
               You do?

     Claire smiles and nods.

18.  INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Later.

     Everybody has lunches now.

     Claire begins to take hers out of a small shopping bag.

                            BENDER
               What's in there?

                            CLAIRE
               Guess, where's your lunch?

                            BENDER
               You're wearing it...

                            CLAIRE
               You're nauseating...

     Bender grabs a Coke and tosses it over to Allison who
     catches it without even looking up.

     Bender then watches Claire set up a sushi platter.

                            BENDER
               What's that?

                            CLAIRE
               Sushi...

                            BENDER
               Sushi?

                            CLAIRE
               Rice, uh, raw fish and seaweed.

                            BENDER
               You won't accept a guys tongue in
               your mouth and you're gonna eat
               that?

                            CLAIRE
               Can I eat?

                            BENDER
               I don't know...give it a try...

     We now watch Andrew take a couple sandwiches out of his
     bag, a bag of potato chips, an apple, a banana, a bag
     of cookies and a carton of milk.

     Allison opens her Coke and it fizzes over.  She loudly
     slurps it up off the table and her fingers.

     Andrew sees Bender looking at him.

                            ANDREW
               What's your problem?

     Allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up.
     It lands on the sculpture above.

     She opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the
     sandwich and then puts Cap'n Crunch on top of that.
     She crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it.

     Bender goes over and sits by Brian, Bender takes
     Brian's bag lunch.

                            BENDER
               What're we having?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, it's your standard, regular
               lunch I guess...

     Bender reaches in the bag and pulls out a thermos.  He
     sets it on the table and points at it.

                            BENDER
               Milk?

                            BRIAN
               Soup.

     Bender goes in again and pulls out a juice box.
     Brian reaches toward the bag and Bender slaps his hand.

                            BRIAN
               That's apple juice...

                            BENDER
               I can read!  PB & J with the crusts
               cut off...Well Brian, this is a
               very nutritous lunch, all the food
               groups are represented.  Did your
               mom marry Mr. Rogers?

                            BRIAN
               Uh, no, Mr. Johnson...

                            BENDER
               Ahhh....

     Andrew and Claire smile at each other.  Bender stands.

                            BENDER
               Here's my impression of life at big
               Bri's house...
                    (in a loud and friendly voice)
               Son!
                    (in a kiddie voice)
               Yeah Dad?
                    (loud)
               How's your day, pal?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, how's yours?
                    (loud)
               Super, say son, how'd you like to go
               fishing this weekend?
                    (kiddie)
               Great Dad, but I've got homework to
               do!
                    (loud)
               That's alright son, you can do it,
               on the boat!
                    (kiddie)
               Geee!!!
                    (loud)
               Dear, isn't our son swell?
                    (quiet and motherly)
               Yes Dear, isn't life swell?

     Bender mimes mother kissing father and then father
     kissing mother and then father punching mother in the
     face.

     Suddenly it's not so funny anymore.

                            ANDREW
               Alright, what about your family?

                            BENDER
               Oh, mine?

                            ANDREW
               That's real easy!

     Bender stands again and points forward.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Stupid, worthless, no good, God
               damned, freeloading, son of a bitch,
               retarded, bigmouth, know it all,
               asshole, jerk!
                       (as his mother)
               You forgot ugly, lazy and
               disrespectful.

     Bender slams his hand back to slap his invisable
     mother.

                            BENDER
                    (as his father)
               Shut up bitch!  Go fix me a turkey
               pot pie!
                    (as himself)
               What about you Dad?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father)
               Fuck you!
                    (as himself--yelling)
               No, Dad, what about you?
                    (as his father--yelling)
               Fuck you!

     He reaches out and pretend he's his father hitting him.

                            BRIAN
               Is that for real?

                            BENDER
                    (to Brian)
               You wanna come over sometime?

                            ANDREW
               That's bullshit.  It's all part of
               your image, I don't believe a word
               of it.

     Bender actually looks hurt.

                     BENDER
               You don't believe me?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BENDER
               No?

                            ANDREW
               Did I stutter?

     Bender comes over to Andrew and rolls up his right
     sleeve to reveal a circular shaped burn.

                            BENDER
               Do you believe this?  Huh?  It's
               about the size of a cigar...Do I
               stutter?  You see, this is what you
               get in my house when you spill paint
               in the garage.

     Bender begins to walk away.

                            BENDER
               See I don't think that I need to
               sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore!

     Bender walks over to a map table and throws all the
     maps on the floor.  He climbs up on top of the table and
     then up to the second floor balcony.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               You shouldn't have said that!

                            ANDREW
               How would I know, I mean he lies
               about everything anyway!

19. INT. VERNON'S OFFICE - DAY

     Vernon puts an orange in his mouth and then attempts to
     pour coffee out of his thermos.  The top comes off and
     the coffee goes all over his desk.

                            VERNON
               Oh, shit!

20. INT. HALLWAY - DAY

     Vernon walks into the hallway, talking to himself.

                            VERNON
               Coffee...looks like they scrape it
               off the bottom of the Mississippi
               river.  Everything's polluted,
               everything's polluted...the coffee.

     Bender comes out of the library doors followed
     bye veryone else.

     Bender and Claire are walking next to each other.
     Brian and Andrew are walking next to each other and at the
     end of the line, Allison is following.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Bender)
               How do you know where Vernon went?

                            BENDER
               I don't...

                            CLAIRE
               Well then, how do you know when he'll
               be back?

                            BENDER
               I don't...being bad feels pretty
               good, huh?

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               What's the point in going to Bender's
               locker?

                            ANDREW
               Beats me...

                            BRIAN
               This is so stupid...Why do you think,
               why are we risking getting caught?

                            ANDREW
               I dunno...

                            BRIAN
               So then what are we doing?

                            ANDREW
               You ask me one more question and I'm
               beating the shit out of you!

                            BRIAN
               Sorry...

     Bender opens his locker.

                            ANDREW
               Slob!

                            BENDER
               My maid's on vacation.

     Bender pulls out a bag of marijuana.

                            BRIAN
               Drugs...

                            ANDREW
              Screw that Bender...put it back!

     Bender walks away.

                         BRIAN
               Drugs...the boy had marijuana.

     Claire walks after Bender.

                            BRIAN
               That was marijuana!

                            ANDREW
               Shut up!

     Andrew follows the other two.  Brian looks at Allison
     who is standing there with her mouth open.

                            BRIAN
               Do you approve of this?

     Brian turns and leaves.  Allison steals the lock off of
     Bender's locker.

     We see the crowd walking down the hall.

                            BENDER
               We'll cross through the lab, and
               then we'll double back.

                            ANDREW
               You better be right, if Vernon cuts
               us off it's your fault, asshole!

                            BRIAN
                    (to Claire)
               What'd he say?  Where're we going?

     They see Vernon down one of the halls.  We have various
     sequences of them running around and seeing Vernon
     until they stop.

                            BENDER
               Wait!  Wait, hold it!  Hold it!  We
               have to go through the cafeteria!

                            ANDREW
               No, the activities hall.

                            BENDER
               Hey man, you don't know what you're
               talking about!

                            ANDREW
               No you don't know what you're
               talking about!

     Allison squeaks.

                            ANDREW
               Now we're through listening to you,
               we're going this way.

     They all go Andrew's way and run into a hall closed by
     an iron gate.

                            ANDREW
               Shit!

                            BENDER
               Great idea Jagoff!

                            ANDREW
               Fuck you!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               Fuck you!  Why didn't you listen to
               John?

                            BRIAN
               We're dead!

                            BENDER
               No, just me!

                            BRIAN
               What do you mean?

                            BENDER
               Get back to the library, keep your
               unit on this!

     Bender puts his bag of marijuana into Brian's
     underwear.

     Bender runs away singing loudly.  I wanna be an
     airborne ranger...

     We see Vernon hear Bender.

     The rest of them run.

                            VERNON
               That son of a bitch!

     We see Vernon looking for Bender until he finds him in
     the gym.

     Bender is going up for a basket.

                            BENDER
               Three...two...one!

     He dunks the ball.  Vernon enters.

                            VERNON
               Bender!  Bender!  Bender!  What is
               this?  What are you doing here, what
               is this?

                            BENDER
               Oh, hi!

                            VERNON
               Out!  That's it Bender!  Out, it's
               over!

                            BENDER
               Don't you wanna hear my excuse?

                            VERNON
               Out!

                            BENDER
               I'm thinking of trying out for a
               scholarship.

                            VERNON
               Gimmie the ball, Bender.

     Bender fakes the ball at Vernon.  He then sets the ball
     down and rolls it at Vernon who kicks it back at him.

     They leave.

     The rest of the kids are all sitting back in their
     seats when Bender and Vernon enter.  Vernon pushes Bender.

               Get your stuff, let's go!
                    (to everyone)
               Mr. Wiseguy here has taken it upon
               himself to go to the gymnasium.  I'm
               sorry to inform you, you're going to
               be without his services for the rest
               of the day.

                            BENDER
                    (to Vernon)
               B-O-O H-O-O!

                            VERNON
               Everything's a big joke, huh Bender?
               The false alarm you pulled, Friday,
               false alarms are really funny,
               aren't they...What if your home,
               what if your family...
                    (a beat)
               ...what if your dope was on fire?

                            BENDER
               Impossible, sir...It's in Johnson's
               underwear...

     Andrew laughs.

                            VERNON
                    (to Andrew)
               You think he's funny?  You think
               this is cute?  You think he's
               bitchin', is that it?  Lemme tell
               you something.  Look at him, he's a
               bum.
                    (to everybody)
               You wanna see something funny?  You
               go visit John Bender in five years!
               You'll see how God damned funny he
               is!
                    (to Bender)
               What's the matter, John?  You gonna
               cry?  Let's go...

     Vernon grabs Bender's shoulder.

                            BENDER
               Hey keep your fuckin' hands off me!
               I expect better manners from you,
               Dick!

     Bender takes his sunglasses out of his pocket and lays
     them in front of Andrew.

                            BENDER
               For better hallway vision!

     Bender leaves but not before pushing stuff over on the

21. INT. CLOSET - DAY

     Vernon has put Bender in a closet and is in there
     talking to him.

                            VERNON
               That's the last time, Bender.  That's
               the last time you ever make me look
               bad in front of those kids, do you
               hear me?  I make $31,000 dollars a
               year and I have a home and I'm not
               about to throw it away on some punk
               like you...But someday, man, someday.
               When you're outta here and you've
               forgotten all about this place...
               And they've forgotten all about you
               and you're wrapped up in your own
               pathetic life...I'm gonna be there.
               That's right.  And I'm gonna kick
               the living shit out of you, man, I'm
               gonna knock your dick in the dirt!

                            BENDER
               Are you threatening me?

                            VERNON
               What're you gonna do about it?  You
               think anybody's gonna believe you?
               You think anybody's gonna take your
               word over mine?  I'm a man of
               respect around here.  They love me
               around here, I'm a swell guy...you're
               a lying sack of shit!  And everybody
               knows it.  Oh, you're a real tough
               guy...come on, come on...get on your
               feet, pal!  Let's find out how
               tough you are!  I wanna know right
               now, how tough you are!  Come on!
               I'll give you the first punch, let's
               go!  Come on, right here, just take
               the first shot!  Please, I'm begging
               you, take a shot!  Come on, just
               take one shot, that's all I need,
               just one swing...

     Bender just sits there staring at Vernon.  Vernon fakes
     a punch and Bender flinches.

                            VERNON
               That's what I though...you're a
               gutless turd!

     Vernon leaves and locks the closet door after him.
     Bender climbs into a hatch in the ceiling and
     disappears.

               tender says: "I suppose you won't
               be needing a drink."  The naked
               lady says...

     The ceiling under Bender gives and he falls through.

               God damnit!  What in God's name is
               going on in here?

     Vernon enters.

              What was that ruckus?

               it!

     We see Bender under the table by Claire's legs.  He
     sits up and bangs his head on the table.  He groans.

     Above the table, Andrew and Claire try to take credit
     for the noise by making more noise.

                            VERNON
               What is that?  What, what is that,
               what is that noise?

     Under the table, Bender looks between Claire's legs and
     can see her panties.  He puts his head between Claire's
     legs.

                            ANDREW
               What noise?

                            CLAIRE
               Really, sir, there wasn't any noise...

     Claire squeels.  She squeezes Bender's head between her
     knees.

     Everyone starts faking a coughing fit.

                            CLAIRE
                    (flustered)
               That noise?  Was that the noise you
               were talking about?

                            VERNON
               No, it wasn't.  That was not the
               noise I was talking about.  Now, I
               may not have caught you in the act
               this time, but you can bet I will.

     Allison laughs at Vernon.

                            VERNON
               You make book on that missy!
                    (to Claire)
               And you!  I will not be made a fool
               of!

     He turns and walks away.  We see that he still has the
     toilet seat cover stuck to his pants.
     Vernon leaves.

     Everyone laughs except Claire who lets Bender out to a
     barage of slaps.

                            BENDER
               It was an accident!

                           CLAIRE
               You're an asshole!

                            BENDER
               So sue me...

     Bender gets up and walks over to Brian.

                            BENDER
               So, Ahab...Kybo Mein Doobage...

     Brian gives Bender his bag of marajuana.  Bender turns
     and walks away.

                            ANDREW
               Yo waistoid...you're not gonna blaze
               up in here!

     Claire gets up and goes after him.  Then Brian.

                            ANDREW
               Shit...

     Andrew goes.

25. INT. STAIRS - DAY

     We see Vernon go down the stairs.

26. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Brian, Bender and Claire are sitting in a circle and
     laughing hysterically.

     Bender lights Claire up and she coughs the smoke out.
     Brian laughs at her.  He exhales and tries to eat the
     smoke.  He talks in a really weird voice.

                            BRIAN
               Chicks, cannot hold der smoke!  That's
               what it is!

                            CLAIRE
               Do you know how popular I am?  I'm
               so popular, everybody loves me so
               much, at this school...

                            BENDER
               Poor baby.

     Brian waves Claire over to him and he falls over.

     We see Andrew emerge from a really smokey room.  He
     inhales another puff and then starts dancing to
     everybody's applause.

     He goes back in the room he was in.  He screams and it
     shatters the glass in the door.

27. INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Vernon is glancing through the confidential files in
the
     school basement.

                            VERNON
                    (to himself)
               Mister, oh mister Tearney...a
               history of slight mental illness?
               Wooh, no wonder he's so fucked up!

     Carl enters.

                             CARL
               Afternoon, Dick...

                            VERNON
               Hey Carl, how you doin'?

                             CARL
               Good...

                            VERNON
               Good, what's up?

                             CARL
               Not much, what's happening, what
               are you doing in the basement files?

                            VERNON
               Oh, nothin' nothin' here.  I'm just
               doin' a little homework here...

                             CARL
               Homework, huh?

                            VERNON
               Yeah...

     Carl, laughing, comes over and looks at the files that
     Vernon was looking at.

                             CARL
               Confidential files...hmmm?

                            VERNON
               Look, Carl...this is a highly
               sensitive area and I, I tell you
               something...certain people would be
               very very embarrassed.  I would really
               appreciate it if if if if this would
               be something that, that you and I
               could keep between us...

                             CARL
               What're you gonna do for me, man?

                            VERNON
               Well, well what would you like?

                             CARL
               Got fifty bucks?

                            VERNON
               What?

                             CARL
               Fifty bucks...

28. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     We see Andrew and Brian laughing.  Allison is hanging
     out over by the statue in the back of the library.

                            ANDREW
               No no man, no; you got a middle
               name?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, guess...

     Allison suddenly takes interest in the conversation and
     as she speaks, she moves over and sits next to the two.

                           ALLISON
               Your middle name is Ralph, as in
               puke...

     Brian and Andrew look at her in confusion.

                           ALLISON
               ...your birthday is March 12th,
               you're five-nine and a half you
               weigh a hundred and thirty pounds
               and your social security number is
               0-4-9-3-8-0-9-1
                    (a beat)
               3.

     Andrew is impressed.

                            ANDREW
               Wow!  Are you psychic?

                           ALLISON
               No...

                            BRIAN
               Well would you mind telling me how
               you know all this about me?

     Allison reaches in her bag.

                           ALLISON
               I stole your wallet...

     She produces it in her hands and grins.

                            BRIAN
               Give it to me...

                           ALLISON
               No...

                            BRIAN
               Give it!

     Allison reluctantly hands over the wallet and Brian
     glances through it to make sure nothing is missing.

                            BRIAN
               This is great...you're a thief too!
               Huh?

                           ALLISON
               I'm not a thief!

                            BRIAN
               Multi-talented!

                           ALLISON
               What's there to steal?  Two bucks
               and a beaver shot!

                            ANDREW
               A what?

                          ALLISON
               He's got a nudie picture in there!
               I saw it, it's perverted!

                            ANDREW
               Alright, let's see it!

     We see Bender, he is brushing his teeth with one of
     Claire's cosmetic brushes.

     We see Claire looking through Bender's wallet pictures.

                            CLAIRE
               Are all these your girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               Some of them...

                            CLAIRE
               What about the others?

                            BENDER
               Well, some I consider my girlfriends
               and some...I just consider...

                            CLAIRE
               Consider what?

                            BENDER
               Whether or not, I wanna hang out
               with them...

                            CLAIRE
               You don't believe in just one guy,
               one girl?

                            BENDER
               Do you?

                            CLAIRE
               Yeah...that's the way it should be.

                            BENDER
               Well, not for me...

                            CLAIRE
               Why not?

     Bender clearly doesn't want to answer that.  He acts
     defensive.

                            BENDER
               How come you got so much shit in
               your purse?

                            CLAIRE
               How come you got so many
               girlfriends?

                            BENDER
               I asked you first...

                            CLAIRE
                    (shrugs)
               I dunno...I guess I never throw
               anything away.

                            BENDER
               Neither do I...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh...

     We cut back to where Andrew, Brian and Allison are
     sitting, Andrew is looking through Brian's wallet.

                            ANDREW
               This is the worst fake ID I've ever
               seen...

     Brian laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Do you realize you made yourself
               sixty eight?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, I know...I know, I goofed it...

                            ANDREW
               What do you need a fake ID for?

                            BRIAN
                    (like it's obvious)
               So I can vote!

     Allison looks up suddenly.

                           ALLISON
               You wanna see what's in my bag?

                        BRIAN & ANDREW
               No!

     Allison looks hurt and then resentful.  Just to spite
     them, she dumps the contents of her bag onto the couch.

     Lots of stuff comes out.

                            ANDREW
               Holy shit!  What is all that stuff?

                            BRIAN
               Do you always carry this much shit
               in your bag?

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...I always carry this much shit
               ...in my bag...You never know when
               you may have to jam...

                            BRIAN
               Are you gonna be like a shopping
               bag lady?  You know like, sit in
               alleyways and like talk to buildings
               and wear men's shoes and that kinda
               thing?

                           ALLISON
               I'll do what I have to do...

                            BRIAN
               Why do you have to do anything?

                           ALLISON
                    (with feeling)
               My home life is un...satisfying...

                            BRIAN
               So you're saying you'd subject
               yourself to the violent dangers of
               the Chicago streets because your
               homelife is unsatisfying?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have to run away and live
               in the street...I can run away and,
               go to the ocean, I can go to the
               country, I can go to the mountains.
               I can go to Israel, Africa,
               Afghanistan...

     Brian looks at her and then moves over to Andrew.

                            BRIAN
               Andy...you wanna get in on this?
               Allison here says, she wants to run
               away, because her home life is
               unsatisfying...

                            ANDREW
               Well everyone's home lives are un-
               satisfying...If it wasn't, people
               would live with there parents
               forever...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, yeah I understand.  But I
               think that her's goes beyond, you
               know, what guys like you and me...
               consider normal unsatisfying...

                           ALLISON
               Nevermind...forget it, everything's
               cool!

     Allison starts putting everything back in her purse.

                            ANDREW
               What's the deal?

                           ALLISON
               No!  There's no deal, Sporto.
               Forget it, leave me alone.

                            ANDREW
               Wait a minute, now you're carrying
               all that crap around in your purse.
               Either you really wanna run away or
               you want people to think you wanna
               run away.

                           ALLISON
               Eat shit!

     Allison gets up and walks away.

                            BRIAN
               The girl is an island, with herself.
               Okay?

     Andrew gets up and goes after her.

                            ANDREW
               Hi, you wanna talk?

                           ALLISON
               No!

                            ANDREW
               Why not?

                           ALLISON
               Go away...

                            ANDREW
               Where do you want me to go?

                           ALLISON
               GO away!

     Andrew turns away and Allison starts to cry.

                           ALLISON
               You have problems...

                            ANDREW
               Oh, I have problems?

                           ALLISON
               You do everything everybody ever
               tells you to do, that is a problem!

                            ANDREW
               Okay, fine...but I didn't dump my
               purse out on the couch and invite
               people into my problems...Did I?
               So what's wrong?  What is it?  Is
               is bad?  Real bad?  Parents?

     Allison is silently crying.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...

     Andrew nods.

                            ANDREW
               What do they do to you?

                           ALLISON
              They ignore me...

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...yeah...

     They both are crying silently.

29. INT. BASEMENT - DAY

     Vernon and Carl are sitting talking.

                            VERNON
               What did you want to be when you
               were young?

                             CARL
               When I was a kid, I wanted to be
               John Lennon...

                            VERNON
               Carl don't be a goof!  I'm trying
               to make a serious point here...I've
               been teaching, for twenty two years,
               and each year...these kids get more
               and more arrogant.

                             CARL
               Aw bull shit, man.  Come on Vern,
               the kids haven't changed, you have!
               You took a teaching position, 'cause
               you thought it'd be fun, right?
               Thought you could have summer
               vacations off...and then you found
               out it was actually work...and that
               really bummed you out.

                            VERNON
               These kids turned on me...they think
               I'm a big fuckin' joke...

                             CARL
               Come on...listen Vern, if you were
               sixteen, what would you think of
               you, huh?

                            VERNON
               Hey...Carl, you think I give one
               rat's ass what these kids think of
               me?

                             CARL
               Yes I do...

                            VERNON
               You think about this...when you get
               old, these kids; when I get old,
               they're gonna be runnin' the country.

                             CARL
               Yeah?

                            VERNON
               Now this is the thought that wakes
               me up in the middle of the night...
               That when I get older, these kids
               are gonna take care of me...

                             CARL
               I wouldn't count on it!

     Vernon ponders that statement for a moment.

30. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     They are sitting on the floor in a circle.

                            ANDREW
               What would I do for a million bucks?
               Well, I guess I'd do as little as I
               had to...

                            CLAIRE
               That's boring...

                            ANDREW
               Well, how'm I s'posed to answer?

                            CLAIRE
               The idea is to like search your mind
               for the absolute limit.  Like, uh,
               would you drive to school naked?

     Andrew laughs.

                            ANDREW
               Um, uh...would I have to get out of
               the car?

                            CLAIRE
               Of course...

                            ANDREW
               In the spring, or winter?

                            CLAIRE
               It doesn't matter...spring...

                            ANDREW
               In front of the school or in back
               of the school?

                            CLAIRE
               Either one...

                            ANDREW
               Yes...

                           ALLISON
               I'd do that!

     They all look at her.

                           ALLISON
               I'll do anything sexual, I don't
               need a million dollars to do it
               either...

                            CLAIRE
               You're lying...

                           ALLISON
               I already have...I've done just
               about everything there is except a
               few things that are illegal...I'm a
               nymphomaniac!

     Claire rolls her eyes.

                            CLAIRE
               Lie...

                            BRIAN
               Are your parents aware of this?

                           ALLISON
               The only person I told was my
               shrink...

                            ANDREW
               And what'd he do when you told him?

                           ALLISON
               He nailed me...

                            CLAIRE
               Very nice...

                           ALLISON
               I don't think that from a legal
               standpoint what he did can be
               construed as rape since I paid him.

                            CLAIRE
               He's an adult!

     Allison is relishing this attention.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah...he's married too!

     Claire notes her disgust.

                            CLAIRE
               Do you have any idea how completely
               gross that is?

                           ALLISON
               Well, the first few times...

                            CLAIRE
               First few times?  You mean he did it
               more than once?

                           ALLISON
               Sure...

                            CLAIRE
               Are you crazy?

                            BRIAN
               Obviously she's crazy if she's
               screwing her shrink...

                           ALLISON
                    (to Claire)
               Have you ever done it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't even have a psychiatrist...

                           ALLISON
               Have you ever done it with a normal
               person?

                            CLAIRE
               Now, didn't we already cover this?

                            BENDER
               You never answered the question...

                            CLAIRE
               Look, I'm not gonna discuss my
               private life with total strangers.

                           ALLISON
               It's kind of a double-edged sword,
               isn't it?

                            CLAIRE
               A what?

                           ALLISON
               Well, if you say you haven't...
               you're a prude.  If you say you
               have...you're a slut!  It's a trap.
               You want to but you can't but when
               you do you wish you didn't, right?

                            CLAIRE
               Wrong...

                           ALLISON
               Or, are you a tease?

                            ANDREW
               She's a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh why don't you just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You're a tease and you know it, all
               girls are teases!

                            BENDER
                    (to Andrew)
               She's only a tease if what she does
               gets you hot...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't do anything!

                           ALLISON
               That's why you're a tease...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, lemme ask you a few questions.

     Allison is suddenly defensive.

                           ALLISON
               I've already told you everything!

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Doesn't it bother you to sleep
               around without being in love.  I
               mean don't you want any respect?

                           ALLISON
               I don't screw to get respect...That's
               the difference between you and me...

                            CLAIRE
               Not the only difference, I hope.

                            BENDER
               Face it, you're a tease.

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not a tease!

                            BENDER
               Sure you are!  You said it yourself
               sex is a weapon, you use it to get
               respect!

                            CLAIRE
               No, I never said that, she twisted
               my words around.

                            BENDER
               Oh then what do you use it for?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't use it period!

     Claire is on the verge of tears.

                            BENDER
               Oh, are you medically frigid or is
               it psychological?

                            CLAIRE
               I didn't mean it that way!  You guys
               are putting words into my mouth!

                            BENDER
               Well if you'd just answer the
               question...

                            BRIAN
               Why don't you just answer the
               question?

                            ANDREW
               Be honest...

                            BENDER
               No big deal...

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, answer it!

                            ANDREW
               Answer the question, Claire!

                            BENDER
               Talk to us!

                       ANDREW & BRIAN
               Come on, answer the question!

                            BENDER
               It's easy, it's only one question!

     Claire silences all of them by screaming.

                            CLAIRE
                    (screaming)
               No!  I never did it!

     Silence for two beats.

                           ALLISON
               I never did it either, I'm not a
               nymphomaniac...I'm a compulsive
               liar...

                            CLAIRE
               You are such a bitch!  You did that
               on purpose just to fuck me over!

                           ALLISON
               I would do it though...If you love
               someone it's okay...

                            CLAIRE
               I can't believe you, you're so
               weird.  You don't say anything all
               day and then when you open your
               mouth...you unload all these
               tremendous lies all over me!

                            ANDREW
               You're just pissed off because she
               got you to admit something you didn't
               want to admit to...

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, fine, but that doesn't make it
               any less bizarre...

                            ANDREW
               What's bizarre?  I mean we're all
               pretty bizarre!  Some of us are just
               better at hiding it, that's all.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               How are you bizarre?

     Allison decides to field that question.

                           ALLISON
               He can't think for himself...

                            ANDREW
               She's right...do you guys know what,
               uh, what I did to get in here?  I
               taped Larry Lester's buns together.

     Claire laughs.

                            BRIAN
                    (to Andrew)
               That was you?

                           ANDREW
                    (to Brian)
               Yeah, you know him?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I know him...

                            ANDREW
               Well then you know how hairy he is,
               right?  Well, when they pulled the
               tape off, most of his hair came off
               and some, some skin too...

                            CLAIRE
               Oh my God...

                            ANDREW
               And the bizarre thing is, is that
               I did it for my old man...I
               tortured this poor kid, because I
               wanted him to think that I was cool.
               He's always going off about, you
               know, when he was in school...all
               the wild things he used to do.  And
               I got the feeling that he was
               disappointed that I never cut loose
               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
               sitting in the locker room, and I'm
               taping up my knee.  And Larry's
               undressing a couple lockers down
               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...
               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I
               started thinking about my father,
               and his attitude about weakness.
               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
               jumped on top of him and started
               wailing on him...And my friends,
               they just laughed and cheered me on.
               And afterwards, when I was sittin'
               in Vernon's office, all I could
               think about was Larry's father. And
               Larry havin' to go home and...and
               explain what happened to him.  And
               the humiliation...fucking
               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It
               mustuv been unreal...I mean,
                    (he's crying)
               I mean, how do you apologize for
               something like that?  There's no
               way...it's all because of me and
               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate
               him!  He's like this...he's like
               this mindless machine that I can't
               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
               you've got to be number one!  I
               won't tolerate any losers in this
               family...Your intensity is for shit!
               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a
               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish
               my knee would give...and I wouldn't
               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he
               could forget all about me...

                            BENDER
               I think your old man and my old man
               should get together and go bowling.

     Andrew laughs briefly.

                            BRIAN
               It's like me, you know, with my
               grades...like, when I, when I
               step outside myself kinda, and
               when I, when I look in at myself
               you know?  And I see me and I don't
               like what I see, I really don't.

                            CLAIRE
               What's wrong with you?  Why don't
               you like yourself?

                            BRIAN
               'Cause I'm stupid...'cause I'm failing
               shop.  See we had this assignment,
               to make this ceramic elephant, and
               um...and we had eight weeks to do
               it and we're s'posed ta, and it was
               like a lamp, and when you pull the
               trunk the light was s'posed to go
               on...my light didn't go on, I got a
               F on it.  Never got a F in my life...
               When I signed up, you know, for the
               course I mean.  I thought I was
               playing it real smart, you know.
               'Cause I thought, I'll take shop,
               it'll be such an easy way to
               maintain my grade point average...

                            BENDER
               Why'd you think it'd be easy?

                            BRIAN
               Have you seen some of the dopes that
               take shop?

                            BENDER
               I take shop...you must be a fuckin'
               idiot!

                            BRIAN
               I'm a fuckin' idiot because I can't
               make a lamp?

                            BENDER
               No, you're a genius because you
               can't make a lamp...

                            BRIAN
               What do you know about Trigonometry?

                            BENDER
               I could care less about
               Trigonometry...

                            BRIAN
               Bender, did you know without
               Trigonometry there'd be no
               engineering?

                            BENDER
               Without lamps, there'd be no light!

                            CLAIRE
              Okay so neither one of you is any
               better than the other one...

     Allison feels left out.

                           ALLISON
               I can write with my toes!  I can
               also eat, brush my teeth...

                            CLAIRE
               With your feet?

                           ALLISON
               ...play Heart & Soul on the piano.

                            BRIAN
               I can make spaghetti!

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Andrew)
               What can you do?

                            ANDREW
               I can...uh...tape all your buns
               together...

                            BENDER
               I wanna see what Claire can do!

                            CLAIRE
               I can't do anything.

                            BENDER
               Now, everybody can do something...

                            CLAIRE
               There's one thing I can do, no
               forget it, it's way too embarrassing.

                            BENDER
               You ever seen Wild Kingdom?  I mean
               that guy's been doing that show for
               thirty years.

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, but you have to swear to God
               you won't laugh...I can't believe
               I'm actually doing this...

     Claire takes lipstick out and opens it.  She places it
     between her breasts and applies it from her cleavage.

     When she lifts her head, her lipstick is perfect.

      Everyone claps.  Bender's clap is sarcastic and slow.

                            ANDREW
               All right, great!  Where'd you learn
               to do that?

                            CLAIRE
               Camp, seventh grade...

                            BENDER
               That was great, Claire...my image of
               you is totally blown...

                           ALLISON
               You're a shit!  Don't do that to her
               you swore to God you wouldn't laugh!

                            BENDER
               Am I laughing?

                            ANDREW
               You fucking prick!

     Bender turns to Andrew.  As he speaks, we can see his
     words hitting home.

                            BENDER
               What do you care what I think,
               anyway?  I don't even count, right?
               I could disappear forever and it
               wouldn't make any difference...I may
               as well not even exist at this
               school, remember?
                    (he turns to Claire)
               And you...don't like me anyway!

                            CLAIRE
               You know, I have just as many
               feelings as you do and it hurts
               just as much when somebody steps
               all over them!

                            BENDER
               God, you're so pathetic!
                    (furious)
               Don't you ever...ever!  Compare
               yourself to me!  Okay?  You got
               everything, and I got shit!  Fuckin'
               Rapunzel, right?  School would
               probably fucking shut down if you
               didn't show up!  "Queenie isn't
               here!"  I like those earrings Claire.

                            CLAIRE
                    (quietly)
               Shut up...

                            BENDER
               Are those real diamonds, Claire?

                            CLAIRE
                    (angry)
               Shut up!

                    BENDER                       CLAIRE
          I bet they are...did you
          work, for the money               Shut...
          for those earrings?                   Your mouth!

                            BENDER
               Or did your daddy buy those?

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious)
               Shut up!

     Claire starts crying.

                            BENDER
               I bet he bought those for you!  I
               bet those are a Christmas gift!
               Right?  You know what I got for
               Christmas this year?  It was a
               banner fuckin' year at the old
               Bender family!  I got a carton of
               cigarettes.  The old man grabbed me
               and said "Hey!  Smoke up Johnny!"
               Okay, so go home'n cry to your
               daddy, don't cry here, okay?

     There are a few beats.

                            ANDREW
               My God, are we gonna be like our
               parents?

                            CLAIRE
               Not me...ever...

                           ALLISON
               It's unavoidable, it just happens.

                            CLAIRE
               What happens?

                           ALLISON
               When you grow up, your heart dies.

                            BENDER
               Who cares?

     Allison is on the verge of tears herself.

                           ALLISON
               I care...

                            BRIAN
               Um, I was just thinking, I mean.  I
               know it's kind of a weird time, but
               I was just wondering, um, what is
               gonna happen to us on Monday?  When
               we're all together again?  I mean I
               consider you guys my friends, I'm
               not wrong, am I?

                            ANDREW
               No...

                            BRIAN
               So, so on Monday...what happens?

                            CLAIRE
               Are we still friends, you mean?
               If we're friends now, that is?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah...

                            CLAIRE
               Do you want the truth?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, I want the truth...

                            CLAIRE
               I don't think so...

                           ALLISON
               Well, do you mean all of us or just
               John?

                            CLAIRE
               With all of you...

                            ANDREW
               That's a real nice attitude, Claire!

                            CLAIRE
               Oh, be honest, Andy...if Brian came
               walking up to you in the hall on
               Monday, what would you do?  I mean
               picture this, you're there with all
               the sports.  I know exactly what
               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up
               so your friends wouldn't think you
               really liked him!

                            ANDREW
               No way!

                           ALLISON
               'Kay, what if I came up to you?

                            CLAIRE
               Same exact thing!

                            BENDER
                    (furious and screaming at Claire)
               You are a bitch!

                            CLAIRE
               Why?  'Cause I'm telling the truth,
               that makes me a bitch?

                            BENDER
               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that
               is to do to someone!  And you don't
               got the balls to stand up to your
               friends and tell 'em that you're
               gonna like who you wanna like!

                            CLAIRE
               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
               Why don't you take Allison to one of
               your heavy metal vomit parties?  Or
               take Brian out to the parking lot at
               lunch to get high?  What about Andy
               for that matter, what about me?
               What would your friends say if we
               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
               doing it with me so they'd forgive
               you for being seen with me.

                            BENDER
                    (furious once again)
               Don't you ever talk about my
               friends!  You don't know any of my
               friends, you don't look at any of my
               friends and you certainly wouldn't
               condescend to speak to any of my
               friends so you just stick to the
               things you know, shopping, nail
               polish, your father's BMW and your
               poor--rich--drunk mother in the
               Carribean!

                            CLAIRE
                    (furious and sobbing)
               Shut up!

                            BENDER
               And as far as being concerned about
               what's gonna happen when you and I
               walk down the hallways at school,
               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never
               gonna happen!  Just bury your head
               in the sand...and wait for your
               fuckin' prom!

                            CLAIRE
               I hate you!

                            BENDER
               Yeah?  Good!

     There is silence until Brian speaks.

                            BRIAN
               Then I assume Allison and I are
               better people than you guys, huh?
               Us weirdos...
                    (to Allison)
               Do you, would you do that to me?

                           ALLISON
               I don't have any friends...

                            BRIAN
               Well if you did?

                           ALLISON
               No...I don't think the kind of
               friends I'd have would mind...

                            BRIAN
               I just wanna tell, each of you,
               that I wouldn't do that...I wouldn't
               and I will not!  'Cause I think that's
               real shitty...

                            CLAIRE
               Your friends wouldn't mind because
               they look up to us...

     Brian laughs at her.

                            BRIAN
               You're so conceited, Claire.  You're
               so conceited.  You're so, like, full
               of yourself, why are you like that?

                            CLAIRE
                    (crying again)
               I'm not saying that to be conceited!
               I hate it!  I hate having to go
               along with everything my friends say!

                            BRIAN
               Well then why do you do it?

                            CLAIRE
               I don't know, I don't...you don't
               understand..you don't.  You're not
               friends with the same kind of people
               that Andy and I are friends with!
               You know, you just don't understand
               the pressure that they can put on
               you!

     Brian is shocked.

                            BRIAN
               I don't understand what?  You think
               I don't understand pressure, Claire?
               Well fuck you!  Fuck you!

     Brian hides his head in his arm because he is crying.

                            BRIAN
               Know why I'm here today?  Do you?
               I'm here because Mr. Ryan found a
               gun in the locker...

                            ANDREW
               Why'd you have a gun in your locker?

                            BRIAN
               I tried.  You pull the fuckin' trunk
               on it and the light's s'posed to go
               on...and it didn't go on, I mean,
               I...

                            ANDREW
               What's the gun for Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Just forget it...

                            ANDREW
               You brought it up, man!

                            BRIAN
               I can't have an F, I can't have it
               and I know my parents can't have it!
               Even if I aced the rest of the
               semester, I'm still only a B.  And
               everything's ruined for me!

                            CLAIRE
                    (with pity)
               Oh Brian...

     Brian bashes a chair over.

                            BRIAN
               So I considered my options, you
               know?

                            CLAIRE
               No!  Killing yourself is not an
               option!

                            BRIAN
               Well I didn't do it, did I?  No, I
               don't think so!

                           ALLISON
               It was a hand gun?

                            BRIAN
               No, it was a flare gun, went off
               in my locker.

                            ANDREW
               Really?

     Andrew starts to laugh.

                            BRIAN
               It's not funny...

     They all start to laugh, including Brian.

                            BRIAN
               Yes it is...fuckin' elephant was
               destroyed!

                           ALLISON
               You wanna know what I did to get in
               here?  Nothing...I didn't have
               anything better to do.

     Everyone laughs.

                           ALLISON
               You're laughing at me...

                            ANDREW
               No!

     Allison starts to laugh too.

                           ALLISON
               Yeah you are!

     We see Brian putting a record on and then music starts.

     We see them all dancing.  This goes on for the duration
     of the song.

33. INT. LIBRARY - DAY

     Andrew, Allison, Claire and Brian are sitting, in that
     order on the railing.

                            CLAIRE
               Brian?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah?

                            CLAIRE
               Are you gonna write your paper?

                            BRIAN
               Yeah, why?

                            CLAIRE
               Well, it's kinda a waste for all of
               us to write our paper, don't you
               think?

                            BRIAN
               Oh, but that's what Vernon wants us
               to do...

                            CLAIRE
               True, but I think we'd all kinda
               say the same thing.

                            BRIAN
               You just don't want to write your
               paper...Right?

                            CLAIRE
               True, but, you're the smartest,
               right?

                            BRIAN
                    (with pride)
               Oh, well...

                            CLAIRE
               We trust you...

     Brian glances over at Allison and Andrew who nod in
     approval.

                            ANDREW
               Yeah...

                            BRIAN
               All right, I'll do it...

                            CLAIRE
               Great...

     Claire looks at Allison who looks back.

                            CLAIRE
                    (to Allison)
               Come on...

                           ALLISON
               Where're we going?

                            CLAIRE
               Come on!

     We see Claire putting eye make-up on Allison.

                            CLAIRE
               Don't be afraid.

                           ALLISON
               Don't stick that in my eye!

                            CLAIRE
               I'm not sticking it, just close...
               just go like that...

     Claire closes her eyes.  Allison mimics her.

                            CLAIRE
               Good...

     Claire puts the make-up on her and Allison squeals.

                            CLAIRE
               You know you really do look a lot
               better without all that black shit
               on your eyes...

                           ALLISON
               Hey...I like that black shit...

                            CLAIRE
               This looks a lot better...look up.

     We see Brian thinking about what he's going to write.

     We see Andrew just thinking.

     We see Allison and Claire again.  Claire is still
     putting make-up on Allison.

                           ALLISON
               Please, why're you being so nice to
               me?

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause you're letting me.

     We see Brian begin to write.

     We see Andrew, still deep in thought.

     Claire stares at him.

     Bender smiles.

     Brian is busily preparing the essay.

     Andrew looks up and sees the newly made over Allison
     and is in awe.

     Allison walks towards him and stops when she notices
     Brian staring at her with his mouth open.

     She glares at him.

                            BRIAN
               Cool!

                            CLAIRE
               'Cause I knew you wouldn't.

                            BENDER
               You know how you said before, how
               your parents used you to get back
               at each other...wouldn't I be
               outstanding in that capacity?

                            CLAIRE
               Were you really disgusted about
               what I did with my lipstick?

               Nothing's wrong, it's just so
               different.  I can see your face.

                           ALLISON

               Saturday in detention for whatever
               it was we did wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make an essay
               telling you who we think we are.
               You see us as you want to see us...
               In the simplest terms, in the most
               convenient definitions.

          EXT. QUARRY OUTSKIRTS - DAY 1

          A narrow dirt road totally surrounded by thick vegetation.
          Here and there we see a huge block of stone blocking the
          road. The sun is shining but it has a hard time making it
          through the foliage. In the distance we see four guys
          walking TOWARD the CAMERA. There is a swagger to their

          The presence of the quarry is felt much stronger now. More
          and more blocks of cut stone appear. The guys are dwarfed
          by them. They have to climb over some.

          He wanted to know if the house

          pauses and looks. High above where he stands on the other

          is standing on the ledge above the water. Our guys are
          looking at the College Kid on the ledge. He seems intent
          on diving into the water. It's a distance of at least eighty
          feet. He pushes off and dives in executing a beautiful

          an architectural mixture of old manor house and modern motel.
          The college kids are outside on the lawns. Some are reading.
          Girls in bikinis sunbathing. Guys washing their cars. Some
          other guys passing the football around. Transistor radios
          playing. Mike drives slowly.

          INT. MIKE'S CAR

          All the guys are looking out of the windows as if they were
          in a museum. Mike looks at the expensive cars along the way.
          Cyril looks at the Girls in bikinis. Moocher looks at the
          huge well-built guys. Dave just looks.

                         CYRIL
          Going to college must do'something
          'to girls' tits. Just look at them.

          The Girls look up and kind of sneer.

          They sure look like they've
          got it made.

          That's because they're rich.

          I wonder what it's like to kiss
          a coed. I wonder about it a lot.
          Ahead of Mike's car we see two Guys and two Girls playing
          Frisbee. They are standing on the lawns and throwing the
          Frisbee to each other across the street. Mike's car is
          moving slowly forward when an ill-thrown Frisbee lands on
          the street. Mike sees it and speeds up. A Girl is running
          to get it but Mike gets there first and runs over it. Dave
          gets a quick look at the Girl as she stops"suddenly to keep
          from getting hit. The two college Guys run out and give'
          Mike the finger. He sees them in the rearview mirror.

                         MIKE
          Hey, those bastards are giving
          us the finger.
          He slams on the brakes.

                         MOOCHER
          Hey, c'mon, Mike. We're on
          their turf.
          Dave is looking back at the Girl. The two Guys are
          challenging Mike, motioning to him to come back. The two
          Girls are trying to talk them out of it. Mike-is gunning
          the car.

                         MIKE
          They think they own the place.

                         MOOCHER
          They do.

                         CYRIL
          Besides, you've humiliated them
          enough. In ancient Japan when
          you ran over a samurai's Frisbee
          he had to commit suicide.
          Just as he laughs Mike shifts the car in reverse. The
          two Guys and Girls are standing in the middle of the road.
          The Guys are coming forward thinking Mike's going to stop,
          but Mike has no intention of stopping. The Girls and the
          Guys split as Mike's car roars between them. Once again
          Dave catches a fleeting glimpse of the Girl. Having
          scattered them, Mike makes a U-turn and drives away in
          the direction he came from.

          MR. BLASE is sitting at a kitchen table. MRS. BLASE is
          boiling water. Mr. Blase does not look happy. He's got
          a flyswatter in his hand. He sees a fly. Whack. He hits
          it. He misses.

          Well, it smells like fruit
          punch to me and it attracts

          Be looks at the posters of the bicycle riders. He looks in
          the mirror. He takes a comb and combs his hair back in the
          "continental" style. Then he smiles. He picks up a book:
          "ITALIAN PEASE BOOK" and lies down on the bed to read it.

          EXT. MR. BLASE'S USED CAR LOT - DAY 14

          A big sign: "CAMPUS CARS."
          The car lot is nowhere near the campus but the sign is
          considered good business. All around the car lot are other
          signs: BEST DEAL IN TOWN. CARS WITH A COLLEGE EDUCATION.
          The cars themselves have signs on them: "GRAD SCHOOL
          SPECIAL." "ENGLISH MAJOR" PhD" "HOMECOMING QUEEN" "CUM

          LAUDE" "MAGNA CUM LAUDE."

          CLOSEUP - MR. BLASE AND CUSTOMER
          The CUSTOMER is a young college kid. Mr. Blase is showing
          him the "HOMECOMING QUEEN."

          MR. BLASE
          It gets thirty miles to a gallon, X
          of course the mileage you get may
          vary. It's a beaut, right? Right.
          You sure know how to pick them.
          Frankly this is the best car on
          the lot. Quality product.

          EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 15

          Students are everywhere and so are classroom buildings. Tall,
          new, limestone structures resembling office buildings.
          Students sit on the steps outside the buildings. They are
          lying around on the grass and walking to and from classes.
          All of them have books in hand. The wind is blowing.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's sitting next to his bike on the grass and looking around
          at all of them. In his hands he has his Italian Phrase Book:
          the book being his admission ticket into this world. It's
          obvious he's feeling a little out of place, but he enjoys
          looking at the campus world. A campus Police Car drives by
          and Dave quickly hides his face in the book. Waits for it
          to pass and when he looks up he is struck by something.

          MED. SHOT - KATHERINE - DAVE'S P.0.V.

          others, just as Dave is doing.

          he cuts in front of them. The horns blow. The brakes
          screech. All Dave sees is the paper. He's on a mission.
          He cuts through the pedestrians crossing the street
          maneuvering brilliantly.

          appears in the FRAME and snatches it away from him. It's
          Dave, riding away with the piece of paper in his hand. The

          crosses on the red light. Once again he's nearly hit by
          several cars. He follows Katherine up the hill leading to
          Fraternity Row. He overtakes her just as. she's about to
          turn into the drive leading to her sorority. But Dave is
          there on her right preventing her-from turning. She too
          almost hits him. She slams on her brakes. Dave slams on
          his. They come to a dead stop.

          Signorina...You...
          He's handing her the paper but then he pauses and pulls it
          back just as she's about to take it. He wipes the saliva
          off the paper on his jersey, and then gives it to her.

                         DAVE
          It is yours...no?
          She takes the paper and smiles. Then she laughs.

          me with this? Well, that's
          redly something. Thank you
          very much. Talk about chivalry.
          Dave is just looking at her. She's never seen anyone look
          at her quite like that. She's a bit confused.

          MRS. BLASE
          It's sauteed zucchini.
          That does it. It reminds him of Dave. It reminds him of the
          kid at'the lot and his contradictory emotions about Dave's
          future.

          He speeds toward him. Jumps the curb with his bike, and
          comes to a dead stop in front of the Mailman. Jumps off the
          bike and hugs the Mailman, kissing him on both cheeks.

          MR. BLASE
          I want an answer, Evelyn.
          What're we going to do with

          I'm afraid to talk to him. I'm
          afraid to look at him. I'm
          afraid if I did, I'd see his
          eyes twirling like pinwheels.
          Mrs. Blase brings the fries.

          MRS. BLASE
          The only reason I'm giving you
          these French fries is because
          you promised to calm down.
          Don't expect to get them
          again.
          Mr. Blase is still annoyed by Dave's music.

          music stops. Mrs. Blase turns around and sees Dave eating
          the French fries. She wants to say something. Mr. Blase

          EXT. COUNTRY-ROAD - DAY 51

          Dave is combing back his hair in the Italian "style" while
          riding. In his other hand, he has his Italian Phrase Book.
          He's not''riding very hard. To the right of him,-in the
          fields, we see a few cows and horses. Above him, on the
          electrical wires, birds are perched like musical notes. He's
          riding and humming.

                         ANOTHER ANGLE
          The CAMERA SWINGS UP PICKING UP the birds on the wires and
          Dave seems to be humming a motif created by'their pattern.
          The utility poles whiz by faster and faster.

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

          Dave is facing the opposite way from the way he came. He's
          at.a standstill. He puts the phrase book away. His face
          changes. He's hyperventilating. A hard competitor's look
          is in his eyes. He looks at his wristwatch.

          EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 5L

          Dave is at a junction of a country road and a highway. He's
          about to ride onto the highway. He looks at his watch as he
          does. We see a truck behind him making the same turn. As
          Dave gets on the highway we see a sign: BLOOMINGTON - 50
          miles. The truck follows him..

          the State Trooper at the side of the road. Dave continues.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          Sweat is dripping down his chin. Pain is beginning to distort
          his face. But his legs move in the same rhythmical motion.

          A LONG SHOT
          We see Dave and his bicycle disappear down one. of the rolling
          hills and then reappear again on the incline.

          A LONGER SHOT
          Dave is now a dot on the horizon.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He shifts gears and starts to sprint. His face is agony now.

          As Dave goes past the sign, he quickly looks at his watch.
          He's elated. A huge grin breaks in his salt-covered face,
          and he reaches for his water bottle and sprays his head with
          it as if it were victory champagne. Ahead of him we see
          the Marlboro Man billboard.

          It's still raining. Moocher is helping the Waitress, NANCY,

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF BLOOMINGTON - DAY 58-A

          Mr. Blase is driving one of the "fanciest" cars off his lot.

          (NOTE: AN OLD LINCOLN OR A CADDY WOULD BE JUST FINE.)

          INT. CAR

          Mr: Blase is dressed neatly. He's wearing a jacket and & .tie
          although it's hot and he's sweating.

          EXT. WOOLRIDGE QUARRY SHOP - DAY 58-B

          Mr. Blase pulls into the parking lot and gets out. He looks
          at the shop. The NOISE of MACHINERY is HEARD from the huge
          building. The NOISE gets LOUDER as Mr. Blase walks toward
          it, trying to avoid stepping into the Limestone dust with his
          polished shoes, but the dust is everywhere.

          EXT. SHOP ENTRANCE 58-C

          Several CUTTERS are having lunch. They are eating heartily
          right outside the shop. The NOISE is EVEN LOUDER but they
          don't seem to be bothered by it. One of them looks.

                         CUTTER ONE
          Well, look who's back.
          He has to shout to be heard. The others look.

          ANGLE ON MR. BLASE
          He's glad to be back but he's also trying to keep a little
          distance as if proud of how far he had come in life. He
          smiles and waves grandly, his suit and tie sticking out in
          this surrounding.

          No, a Union Organizer.
          They all laugh and get up to greet him. All except one
          younger man who continues sitting and eating. The Cutters
          slap Mr. Blase on the back, their dusty hands leaving dusty
          imprints on his jacket.

                         CVITER THREE
          We'll start you as an

          visiting. But if I wanted to
          come back I could pick up where
          I left off.
          The entrance to the shop draws him forward. A couple of the
          Cutters accompany him. He takes half of a sandwich from one
          of them. It's lunch hour at the shop and the old instincts
          are coming back.

                         YOUNG CUTTER
          Who's he?
          Mr. Blase looks back over his shoulder hurt by this remark.

          I . SHOP DAY
          The NOISE is now DEAFENING. Dust is everywhere and slowly
          through the dust we see men working, pausing only long enough
          to smile and wave at Mr. Blase. Mr. Blase is finishing off
          his sandwich just like the Cutter next to him who walks to
          his place leaving Mr. Blase, who has no place here, to wonder.

          happier as he continues.

          All three of them start up the long stairway leading to the
          fortress-like Union.

          INT. STUDENT UNION - NIGHT 93

          Rod and his Girl are looking for a place to sit. Seeing no
          empty spots in the area they head toward the area where Dave
          and Katherine are sitting. Just as they're about to turn the
          corner and probably see them somebody gets up and Rod takes
          the table.

          They are drinking their coffee.

                         KATHERINE
          It's kind of nice to hear of
          somebody who misses his parents.

                         DAVE Â¢
          Certo, I miss. Just like you
          miss your Mama and Papa.
          I hardly miss them. I went as
          far as I could to get away from
          them.

                         DAVE
          Ah, but they miss you, eh? At
          home they sit and look at your.
          picture: Ah, they are saying,
          how we miss our Katherina, our
          bambina...
          Katherine is near tears. The homelife Dave's describing is
          obviously not hers. Not wanting to cry she takes out a
          cigarette and a lighter and Dave, being a continental
          gentleman, takes the lighter from her. He doesn't know what
          to make of it. He fiddles with it and then strikes and a
          huge jet of flame shoots out. Dave-is frightened. He lets
          go of the button, but the lighter is stuck and the flame is
          still burning., He blows'on it. He shakes it. Katherine
          starts laughing. Finally, in desperation Dave pours coffee
          on the lighter and it goes out.

          They are standing in the Uhion wondering where to go. They
          look lost and intimidated but trying to look tough. Dave
          appears in their field of vision at the end of the cafeteria
          line but they are looking elsewhere.. Just as they seem to
          turn and see him Mike spots a tall BLOND GUY, very much
          like Rod, going into the bowling alley.
          There he is.
          Our trio heads for the bowling alley.

          training and the Italians... they
          don't. The Italians... they beat
          the pants off Germans.
          Dave thinks this is funny and laughs. Rod turns around and
          gives him a scornful look. Dave recognizes-him. Rod doesn't
          recognize Dave.

          is stuck in the hole.

          College rids are looking at them. It's obvious who they are.

          Mike sees him. It's clear he wishes he didn't. Moocher
          resigns himself to the inevitable. Starts wrapping a
          handkerchief around his fist. Cyril is cringing.

          A bunch of Rod's cronies sitting nearby-laughs. They crowd
          in around the cutters. Cyril and Moocher look at Mike for
          guidance. Mike is on the spot. It's not that he's afraid
          of a fight, it's just that he's on a foreign turf.

          Spilling the drinks all over him. Rod falls back knocking
          the table down. His friends jump up to his aid. Our guys
          are surrounded. The only opening is the cafeteria line.
          Mike is hit and falls back knocking down a tail row of plates,
          saucers, cups. Cyril is swinging the bowling ball around
          himself for protection. More rows of plates fall as the
          ball hits-them. The College Guys, led by Rod are trying to
          advance but our guys are throwing plates and maybe even food
          at them. The College Guys are throwing back what they can.
          Cyril's ball flies off and hits somebody in the stomach.

          years here but to a lot of us
          Bloomington is our home and .1
          don't like the way you are behaving
          in my home. These needless
          hostilities have happened before.
          They will not happen again. If
          you feel compelled to compete with
          the kids from the town then you
          will do it in a different arena.
          I am looking at a plan to open
          our intramural program to them.
          And as a starting point, in
          consultation with Mr. Armstrong,
          we have decided to expand the
          field of this year's Little 500
          to include a team from the town.
          A loud protest is heard from everybody.

          and his group. Dave sees Katherine and without making it
          obvious to the others leans back behind a rock.

          gang on him. He gestures to Rod to come in the water. Mike

          It's raining. Mr. Blase is standing in the doorway of his
          office looking out. Dave is riding the "rollers" and eating
          his lunch. There's nowhere to hide from the rain so he's
          getting wet. He looks tired. He's thinking of the Italians.
          As he turns his legs we see: THE PICTURE OF THE ITALIANS

          FROM THE COMPETITIVE CYCLING MAGAZINE: FOUR OF THEM, ARMS
          AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Then we see another picture,
          Dave is in the middle of the Italians. He has his arms
          around them. He's smiling just like they are.

          He starts to push real hard.

          becomes a fanatic. His veins are swelling on his neck. The
          world becomes'all blurred through his eyes, but he pushes.

          the hood.

          We PICK UP the last rider in the field and MOVE PAST him.
          There are stragglers already: individuals and little groups,
          and then a large group. We MOVE PAST them TOWARD:

          ANGLE ON THE LEAD GROUP
          The Italians, Dave and half a dozen other riders are in the
          lead group. They are separated from the rest by about half
          a mile. Some riders in the group are eating their bananas.
          Others are drinking water. They are approaching a hill. The
          Italians shift their gears and like clockwork the rest of the
          riders do the same. The Italians start sprinting up the hill
          The others pursue. Strain is showing on everybody.

                         LONG SHOT
          We see the pack climbing the hill.

          ANGLE ON CREST OF THE HILL
          The Italians appear first.. They look back over their
          shoulders and see nobody there. They nod to each other and
          continue over the crest, shifting into a higher gear for the
          descent. Dave and three riders appear over the crest. Dave
          is in the lead. As he goes over the crest, he shifts gears
          and starts to sprint. The other riders cannot match him.

                         CUT TO:

          ANGLE ON ITALIANS
          They are bent over their frames in their descent positions.
          Their knees and elbows are tucked in and they are coasting
          down the hill.

          ANGLE ON THE ITALIANS
          They are still in their descent. The hill is steep and they
          are going very fast. Suddenly, Dave, bent over and breathing
          hard appears in the FRAME. He tries to appear that he's not
          tired. He smiles.

                         DAVE
          Buon giorno. Come sta?
          The Italians look stunned. The 1ST ITALIAN is annoyed. The
          ZTH ITALIAN seems amused.

          FRONT SHOT - THE FLATS 135
          The Italians are riding hard. The effort is showing on their
          faces. Dave is behind them. He too is tired. But when the
          1st Italian looks back to see how Dave is doing Dave manages
          to smile. This seems to "psyche" the lst Italian out. He
          gestures angrily to Dave to take his turn up front. Dave is
          thrilled at the command. He moves to the front. The
          following conversations will have to be subtitled.

                         DAVE

          Dave swings off to let another rider pull in front. As he
          does Dave once again smiles. He doesn't do this to fool
          them. He's just thrilled to be in their company.

          ANGLE ON THE HILL 136
          The Italians are switching off as they begin another ascent.
          It's Dave's turn to take the lead. As he goes up front the
          1st Italian reaches in and pushes Dave's lever all the way
          forward. This suddenly shifts Dave into a very high gear.
          He can hardly turn the cranks. The 1st Italian smiles at him.

                         1ST ITALIAN

                         MI SCUSII

          Dave at the front again.

          CLOSEUP - DAVE
          He's getting a little more serious. He sees a huge pothole
          in front of him. He rides right toward it and then at the
          last second he jerks his bike aside. The 1st Italian goes
          right over the pothole. He's jarred and angry. Dave looks
          back. Smiles.

                         DAVE
          Mi scusi!
          The 4th Italian appreciates this little reversal. The
          lst Italian is getting a brutal look in his face.

          All five of them are continually taking turns being up front.
          They are approaching a small hill. The lst Italian points
          to the hill. Dave is too exhausted now to fake any smiles.
          The pace is as hard as it's been.

          ANGLE ON THE CREST OF THE HILL 139
          Dave is up front.
          Behind him we see the 2ND ITALIAN taking out his pump. Dave
          pulls off to let him take the lead but as he does the
          lst Italian pulls up behind him to block his way back. The
          3RD ITALIAN sprints up front to block his way forward. Dave
          is trapped. The 3rd Italian puts on his brakes. Dave puts
          on his to avoid running into him. As his speed slows down
          the 2nd Italian sticks his pump into Dave's rear wheel. Dave
          sees all this. In the split second that it takes, he sees
          it all. His wheel collapses and Dave tumbles off the road
          falling down the steep grade. The Italians ride off. The
          4th Italian slows down a little to look at Dave. He seems
          genuinely sorry about what happened but he too continues.
          He shouts after his teammates. He's a little angry.

          The tour Italians are sprinting toward the finish line. A
          large "FINISH" sign flutters in the breeze. The 4th Italian
          wins and as he does he turns and fives the "Italian finger"
          to his three buddies. He's still angry at them. Cyril,
          Mike and Moocher look for Dave. The crowd is cheering.

          EXT. ROAD - DAY 140-A

          All the guys are riding in silence. Dave is crushed by his
          shattered Italian dream. Mendelsohn's Italian Symphony is
          playing: the second movement. They drive past the finish
          line of the race. The big cloth sign "FINISH" is still up
          fluttering in the wind. A man is taking it down. Everybody
          else is gone. Dave looks on heartbroken.

          MR. BLASE
          I've got work to do. That's all.
          Besides,-there might be another
          metabolism feed around here.

                         DAVE
          You mean you might be a father.

          MR. BLASE
          Yes, I might, and your mom might be-
          a mother and you might be a brother.
          That way I keep it all in the family.

                         MOOCHER

          kid.
          Dave looks at him. Then he looks at his mother. She smiles.
          Dave looks back at his father.
          Dave jumps up and hugs his mother.

                         MOOCHER
          You must be very happy, Mr. Blase.

          MR. BLASE
          Of course I must. You think I have
          any choice?

          MRS. BLASE
          You said you were going to give them
          a pep talk.

          MR. BLASE
          They don't need pep.. I need pep.
          Go ahead...Give it to them.
          Mrs. Blase opens a kitchen drawer and takes out some folded

          We see them from the back. The word "CUTTERS" is stamped on
          the back of their T-shirts. There is something comical about
          this team. They are so uneven. Cyril is very tall. Moocher
          is very short. They are walking out of step. All the other
          teams are matched in height to accommodate the use of a bike
          w.th a set saddle position.

          CLOSEUP - OUR GUYS
          They seem very nervous. The roar of the crowd. The other
          teams. The foreign turf once again. Mike seems the most
          nervous of all. They walk past Rod's team. Rod is smiling
          and staring at Mike. Mike looks away. Cyril doesn't.

          The lead that they had is evaporating. The other riders are

          up to Mike, pushes him away and gets on the bike. His
          intentions are great, but his legs are short. He can't sit
          in the saddle and reach the pedals. So he stands and rides

          else except the music, and music seems to be carrying him

          Rod who's riding on the inside. They are going around the
          curve. Rod drifts out a bit and that's all the room that
          Dave needs. He takes the inside edge as they come around
          for the final stretch. All three of them stand up and begin
          their final sprint. It looks dead even as they're
          approaching the finish line. A man is waving the checkered

	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small

	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

				GERALD
		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

				TOM
		No.  Not even you.

				GERALD
		Why so glum?

				TOM
		I don't know.

				GERALD
			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

				TOM
		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

				GERALD
		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

				TOM
		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

				GERALD
		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

				TOM
		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

				GERALD
		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

				TOM
		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

				TOM
		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

				GERALD
		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

				TOM
		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

				TOM
		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

				GERALD
			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

				TOM
			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)
		It better help.  What can you do with
		yourself if all you do is look good?

		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

	ANGLE ON TEACHERS

				MALE TEACHER
		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

	ANGLE ON STAGE

	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

				YOUTH #1
		Later, Aaron.

	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

	CLOSER IN

	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

				AARON
		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

				AARON
		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

				AARON
		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

				YOUTH TOUGH
		Nineteen thousand dollars...
		Not bad.

	FADE IN

	ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968

	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

				JANE
			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

	OTHER ANGLE

	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

				JANE
			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

				FATHER
			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

				JANE
		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

				FATHER
		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

				JANE
		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

				FATHER
		You don't have to finish tonight.

				JANE
			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

				FATHER
		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

				JANE
		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

	ON JANE

	As she dials one room number.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Hi...It's me...

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
	essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
	to Jane.

				JANE'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		It's thirty minutes before you have
		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

				AARON
		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		Good Morning America, the
		Morning News and Today are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

				JANE
		A half hour in the lobby.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	INT. BUS STATION - DAY

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

				AARON
		Ready.
 
				CAMERAMAN
		Your hair's a little funny.

				AARON
		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

				CAMERAMAN
		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

				AARON
		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

				CAMERAMAN
		Okay.

	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

				AARON
		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

				AARON
		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

				CAMERAMAN
		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

				AARON
		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

	INT. GATE AREA - DAY

	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

				J.D.
		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

				AARON
		Just a few questions?

				J.D.
		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

				AARON
		We came from Washington.

				J.D.
		Move away from me.

				AARON
			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

				J.D.
			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

				AARON
		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

				JANE
		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

				AARON
		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

				JANE
		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

				AARON
			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

				J.D.
			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

				JANE
		I love that turn away.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

				JANE
			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

				WOMAN
			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
	A WOMAN in blackness.

				WOMAN THREE
			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

				JANE
		Please don't applaud.

	ON AUDIENCE

	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

				JANE
		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's WRONG with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

				JANE
		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

				JANE
		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

	TRACKING SHOT

	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

				JANE
		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

	SHOT CONTINUES

	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

	ON JANE

	Briefly departing from text.

				JANE
		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

				TOM
		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

	BACK TO JANE

	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

				JANE
		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

	ON MONITORS

	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

	ON SCENE

	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

				JANE
			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

	OTHER ANGLE

	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

				TOM
		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

	ANGLE ON TOM

	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

				JANE
		Hi.

				TOM
		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

				JANE
			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

				TOM
		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

				JANE
		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

				JANE
		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

				TOM
		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

				TOM
		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

				JANE
			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

				TOM
		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

				TOM
		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

				JANE
		If we could just eat first.

				TOM
		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

				JANE
		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

				JANE
		Thank you.

	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

				JANE
		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

				TOM
		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

				TOM
		That actually goes on...

				JANE
		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

				TOM
		Yes, sure.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

				TOM
		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

				TOM
		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

				JANE
			(levelly)
		I trust you.

				TOM
		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

				TOM
		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

				TOM
		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

				JANE
		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

				TOM
		One year...almost one year.

				JANE
		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

				TOM
		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

				JANE
		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

				TOM
		Uh-huh.

				JANE
			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

				TOM
		Whoa, this was a mistake.

				JANE
		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

				JANE
		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

				TOM
		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She is on the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As he talks with Jane.

				AARON
			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

				JANE
		Why do you say that?

				AARON
		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

				AARON
		Okay.  Let's do me.

				JANE
		Sure.

				AARON
		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

				JANE
		This conversation is not worthy of you.

				AARON
		I'd give anything if that were true.

				JANE
			(laughing)
		Good night.

				AARON
		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

				JANE
		Call if you get weird.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

				JANE
			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH

	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

				TOM
		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

				JANE
			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

	INTERCUT:

	ON TOM

				TOM
		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

				JANE
		What???

	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

				AARON
		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the Times and he had a great
		audition tape.

				JANE
		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Tom arrives for first day of work.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

				JANE
			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

				BOBBIE
		We could...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

				TOM
		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

				TOM
		They said it would be okay if...

				JANE
			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

				JANE
		Play back the last line...

				BOBBIE
		He said something about...

				JANE
			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

				BLAIR
		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

	TOM

	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

				MERCENARY
			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

				JANE
		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

				BLAIR
		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

				BLAIR
		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

				JANE
		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

				BOBBIE
		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				AARON
		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

				AARON
		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

				KLEIN
		Sure.

				JENNIFER
		Why not?

				ERNIE
		Absolutely.

				GEORGE
		You bet.

				AARON
		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

				BLAIR
		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

				ERNIE
		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

				BLAIR
		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

				AARON
		What is she shooting?

				BLAIR
		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

				AARON
			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

				JANE
		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

				BOBBIE
		Should I...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

				BLAIR
			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

				AARON
		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a Homecoming  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

				BLAIR
		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

				BLAIR
		In 84 seconds?

	ON CLOCK

	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

				JANE
			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

				AARON
		Eleven and a half.

				JANE
		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

				BLAIR
		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

	ON CLOCK

	42 seconds away.

				BLAIR
		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

				BOBBIE
		Whoops.

				BLAIR
			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

				AARON
		Shit, shit, shit...

				TOM
			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

				BOBBIE
		Ready.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

				BLAIR
		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

				AARON
		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

	ON MONITOR

	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

				BILL
			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

				JENNIFER
		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
		liked it.

				AARON
		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

				BLAIR
		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

				BLAIR
		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

				ERNIE
		I saw the smile -- good piece.

				AARON
		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

				TOM
		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

				JANE
			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

				TOM
		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

				JANE
		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

				TOM
		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

				JANE
		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

				TOM
		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

				JANE
		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

				TOM
		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

				JANE
		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

				AARON
		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

				JANE
		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

				AARON
		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

				JANE
		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

	ANGLE ON

	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

				CAMERAMAN
		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

				JANE
		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

				TOM
		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

				CONCIERGE
		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

				AARON
		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

				AARON
		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

				JANE
		Let's tape.

				CAMERAMAN
			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

				JANE
		That's okay.

	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

				AARON
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

				AARON
		Did you shoot their boots?

				JANE
		Of course.

				AARON
		We can cut back at the end.

				JANE
		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

				AARON
		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

				REPORTER
		I think he's coming out now.

				TOM
			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

				TOM
			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

	ON TOM

	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

				CAMERAMAN
			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

				TOM
		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

				CAMERAMAN
		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

				JANE
		Are you all packed and ready?

				CAMERAMAN
		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

				JANE
		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

	ON TELEVISION MONITORS

	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

				BLAIR
		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

				ERNIE
		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

	ON JANE

	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

				TOM
		Hi.

				JANE
		How's it going?

				TOM
		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

				JANE
			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

				TOM
		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

				BLAIR
		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

	ON MONITOR

	We see Bill Rorish.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Jane?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		But thanks.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

				JANE
		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

				JANE
			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

				TOM
			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

				AARON
		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

				AARON
		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

				BLAIR
		What did he say?

				JANE
			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

				BUDDY
		Could I see how I photograph?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Huh?  Sorry?

				BUDDY
		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

				AARON
		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		That's your full name?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

				BUDDY
		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

				AARON
		Eventually rising to...

				BUDDY
		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

				AARON
		Eventually rising to?

				BUDDY

		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

				BUDDY
		I don't like the word gay.

				AARON
		Which would you prefer?

				BUDDY
		Ravenous homosexual.

				AARON
		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

				BUDDY
			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

				BUDDY
		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

				TOM
		No, I don't think so.

				BUDDY
		How do I get out of here?

				TOM
		Follow me.

				BUDDY
			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

				GUARD
		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

				BUDDY
		I'm leaving.

				TOM
			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

				BUDDY
		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

				TOM
		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

				BUDDY
		Is there a regular bar around here?

	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

				TOM
		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

				BUDDY
		Bad manners.

				TOM
		Yes.  That's right.

				BUDDY
		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

				TOM
		No...no.

				BUDDY
		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

				TOM
		I really have to go.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

				TOM
		What?

				BUDDY
		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

				TOM
		Yes.  How do you know?

				BUDDY
			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

				GEORGE
		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

				ERNIE
			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

				TOM
		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

				GEORGE
			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

				TOM
		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

				ERNIE
		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

				BOBBIE
		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

				JANE
		No stop where he's all besieged.

				BOBBIE
		Because...

				JANE
			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

				TOM
		So he was indicted?

				JANE
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		We were right not to go with it.

				TOM
		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

				JANE
			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

				TOM
		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

				BOBBIE
			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

				JANE
		Bobbie, please.

	INT. METRO BUS - DAY

	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

				BUDDY
		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

				TOM
		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

				BUDDY
			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

				TOM
		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

				BUDDY
		I see the change in you -- I see it.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
	network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
	steers her outside.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

				JENNIFER
		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

				TOM
		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

				JENNIFER
		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

				TOM
		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

				JENNIFER
		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a
		great tour.

	INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
	her story.

				JENNIFER
			(voice over; on TV set)
		The President says it's not a violation
		but nonetheless White House sources
		say the full price will be paid for the
		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

				BUDDY
		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

				TOM
		Nobody else had it.

				BUDDY
		I wish it were you giving the story.

				TOM
		That's okay.

				BUDDY
		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

				TOM
		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

				TOM
		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
	RAPTURE.

				BUDDY
		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

				TOM
		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

				BUDDY
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

				JANE
		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

				TOM
		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

				TOM
		I've got another story.

				JANE
		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

				TOM
		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

				JANE
		Billion.

				TOM
		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		You write this?

				JANE
		I write for you sometimes.

				AARON
		Not because you have to.

	ON MONITOR

	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

				GENERAL
		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

				TOM
		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

	ON TOM

	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

				BLAIR
		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

				AARON
		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

				JANE
		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

				BLAIR
		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

				ERNIE
		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

				TOM
		Hi, Ellie.

				ERNIE
		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

				AARON
			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

				ELLIE
		I'm sorry -- from where?

				AARON
		I've been to your house a lot...

				ERNIE
			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

				ELLIE
			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

	Tom is on the phone.

				TOM
			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

				BLAIR
		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

				BLAIR
		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

				GREY HAIRED MAN
			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

				BLAIR
		Goodbye, Paul.

				AARON
		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

				BLAIR
		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

				AARON
		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

				BLAIR
		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

				AARON
		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

	ON JANE

	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

				JENNIFER
		This is very awkward.

				JANE
		Go ahead -- what?

				JENNIFER
		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

				JANE
		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

				JENNIFER
		You're saying stay away from him.

				JANE
			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

				JENNIFER
		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

				GEORGE WELN
		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

				ERNIE'S WIFE
			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

				JANE
			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

				TOM
		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

				JANE
		What do you mean clean?

				TOM
		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

				JANE
		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

				TOM
		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

				JANE
		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

	ON AARON AND ERNIE

				ERNIE
		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

				AARON
		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

				ERNIE
		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

				ANNE
		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

				ANNE
		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

	ON JANE

	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

				JANE
		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

	ON STAIRCASE

	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

				JANE
		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

				JENNIFER
		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

				JENNIFER
		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

	FULL SCENE

	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

				ERNIE
		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

				ERNIE
			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

				JANE
		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

				ERNIE
		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

				JANE
		Let's figure out the field.

				ERNIE
		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

				AARON
		That's it.  I resign as of now.

				ERNIE
			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

				AARON
		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

				JANE
		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

				ERNIE
		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

	ON JANE

	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

				TOM
		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

				JANE
		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

				PAUL
		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

				JANE
		It's not opinion.

				PAUL
		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

				PAUL
		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

				JANE
			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

				JANE
			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

				AARON
		What happened?

				JANE
		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

				AARON
		Watch? --

				JANE
		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

				AARON
		Yeah, love you, too.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

	As it moves off.

				JANE
		Nervous?

				TOM
		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

				JANE
		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

				BLAIR
		And Bobbie says...

				JANE
		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

				BLAIR
			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

				JANE
		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

				JANE
		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

				JANE
		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

				GRAPHIC ARTIST
		We have no pictures on file.

				JANE
		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

				GUARD
		I have to check first.

				BUDDY
			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

				BUDDY
		Is everything all right?

				TOM
		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

				BUDDY
			(delighted)
		Anchor?

				TOM
			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

				BUDDY
		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

				TOM
		Oh.

				BUDDY
		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

				TOM
		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

				BUDDY
		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

				TOM
		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

				BUDDY
			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

				TOM
		I'll speak to you.

				BUDDY
		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

				BLAIR
			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

				JANE
		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

				TOM
			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

				TOM
		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

				MAN ONE
		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

				PAUL
		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

				TOM
		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

				AARON
			(SINGING LOUDLY)
		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

	ON TV

	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

	INT. BOOTH

	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

				JANE
		George, you're ready.

	ON PENTAGON MONITOR

	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

				GEORGE
			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

				JANE
		Cover everything!

	George nods.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

	ON TOM

				TOM
		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

				AARON
		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	As Blair hands it to Jane.

				BLAIR
		It's Aaron.

				JANE
		Yes?

				AARON
		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

				JANE
		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

				TOM
		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

				GEORGE
		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

				AARON
		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

				AARON
			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

	ON JANE

				JANE
		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

				AARON
			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

				AARON
		Nice, Jane.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

	ON TOM

	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

	BACK TO JANE

	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

				JANE
		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

				PAUL
			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

				TOM
			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

				TOM
		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

				TOM'S VOICE
		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

				PAUL
		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

				ERNIE
			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

				JANE
		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

				JANE
		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

				PAUL
			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

				PAUL
			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

				TOM
		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

				ERNIE
			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

				MARVIN
		We're here to play the new news theme.

				ERNIE
		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

				PAUL
		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

				MAN ONE
		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

				PAUL
		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

				ERNIE
		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

				TOM
		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

				JANE
			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

				TOM
		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

				TOM
		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

				JANE
		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

				TOM
		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

				JANE
			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

				TOM
		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

				TOM
		Jane?

				JANE
		Yeah?

				TOM
		I'll wait for you till seven.

				JANE
			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

	ON AARON

	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

				JANE
		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

				JANE
		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

				AARON
		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

				AARON
		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

				JANE
		Well, whatever you think.

				AARON
		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

				JANE
		Sounds like you may be on to something.

				AARON
		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

				JANE
		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

				AARON
		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

				JANE
		Yes.

				AARON
		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

				AARON
		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	ON JANE

	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

	INT. CAB - EVENING

				JANE
		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

				JANE
		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

				DRIVER
		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

				JANE
		Thanks -- good driving --

				DRIVER
		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

				JANE
		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

				TOM
		I didn't think you'd make it.

				JANE
		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

				TOM
		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

				JANE
		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

				JANE
		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

				JENNIFER
			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

				JANE
			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

				TOM
		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

				JENNIFER
			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

				JENNIFER
		Sorry.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

				TOM
		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

				JENNIFER
		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

				TOM
			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

				JENNIFER
		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

				JENNIFER
		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

				TOM
		Where's the bathroom?

				JENNIFER
		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

				JENNIFER
		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

				TOM
		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

				JENNIFER
		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

				TOM
		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

				AARON
		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

				JANE
		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

				JANE
		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

				AARON
		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

				BLAIR
		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

				JANE
			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

				PAUL
		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

				JANE
			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

				JANE
		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

				TOM
		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

				JANE
			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

				JANE
		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

				TOM
		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

				JANE
		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
		Is it safe for me to fly home?

				TOM
		Yes.  We're fine now.

				JANE
		AND SMILE.

	He smiles -- people smile back.

				JANE
		AND MOVE.

	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

				AARON
		Who the heck could that be?

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

	ON AARON

	And now he sees that it's Tom.

				AARON
		Is God testing me or something?

				MARTIN KLEIN
		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

				AARON
		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

				TOM
		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

				AARON
		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

				TOM
		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

				AARON
		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

				TOM
		What did I do to you?

				AARON
		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

				TOM
			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

				AARON
			(several beats; then)
		How you doing?

				TOM
			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

				AARON
		Keep it to yourself.

				TOM
		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

				AARON
		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

				AARON
		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

				TOM
		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

				AARON
			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

				TOM
		Shut up a second...

				AARON
			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

				TOM
			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

				AARON
		And the rule was...

				TOM
		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

				AARON
		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

				TOM
			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

				AARON
		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

				AARON
			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

				TOM
		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

				AARON
		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

				TOM
		Yes.

				AARON
		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

				TOM
		You're feeling good, aren't you?

				AARON
			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

				TOM
			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

	LONG SHOT

	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

				TOM
		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

				JANE
		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

				TOM
		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

				TOM
		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

				JANE
		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

				TOM
			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

				JANE
		What?

				TOM
		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

				JANE
		Well, what is it?

				TOM
		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

				TOM
		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

				TOM
		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

	ON TOM

	His spirits lifted.

	ON JANE

	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

				JANE
		Hello.

				TO
			(uncertain)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Hello...Who is it?

	INTERCUT:

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

				JANE
		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

				TOM
		Yes.

				JANE
		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

				TOM
		It's not important.

				JANE
		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

				TOM
		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

				JANE
		Nooo.  Is it your story?

				TOM
		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

				JANE
		Why, you need me for the story?

				TOM
		No.  Were you going to you?

				JANE
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

				JANE
		Oh, good.

				TOM
		We can go together.


				JANE
		So you like me, huh?

				TOM
		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

				TOM
			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

				BOBBIE
		Yes, and thanks for asking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

	ON MONITOR

				UNIFORMED COP
		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

				YOUNG WOMAN
		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

	ON NEWSROOM

	As Aaron enters the scene.

				AARON
		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

	ON MONITOR

				YOUNG WOMAN
		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

	ON MONITOR

	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

	ON NEWSROOM

	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

				AARON
		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

				TOM
			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

	NEWSROOM

	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

				AARON
		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

				TOM
		What's wrong with it?

				AARON
		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

	MONITOR

	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

	ON JANE

	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

	ON TOM AND JANE

	Now off a bit by themselves.

				TOM
		So what did you think?

				JANE
		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

				TOM
			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				JENNIFER
		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

				BLAIR
		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

				ERNIE
		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

				AARON
			(puzzled)
		Outside?

				ERNIE
		Yeah --

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

				ERNIE
		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

				AARON
		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

				ERNIE
			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

				AARON
		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

				ERNIE
		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

				AARON
		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

				ERNIE
		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

				ERNIE
		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

				AARON
		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

				ERNIE
		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

				AARON
			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

				ERNIE
		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

				AARON
			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

				ERNIE
		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

				AARON
		Do it then.

				ERNIE
		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

				AARON
		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

				ERNIE
		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

				AARON
		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

				ERNIE
		I understand.  I'll go with you.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

				AARON
		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

				TOM
		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

				AARON
		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

				TOM
		Wait.

				AARON
		What?

				TOM
		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

				TOM
		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

				AARON
			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

				TOM
		Sit on it!  Now look.

				AARON
		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

				TOM
		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

				AARON
		It's not loaded.

				TOM
		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

				TOM
		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

				AARON
		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

				AARON
		I'm very appreciative.

	SAME SCENE - LATER

	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

				TOM
		No.  No.

				AARON
		No?

				TOM
		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

				AARON
		Oh, God, no!

				TOM
		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

				TOM
		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

				AARON
		Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

				TOM
		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

				TOM
		You were smokin' toward the end there.

				AARON
		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

				TOM
		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

				AARON
		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

				AARON
		I didn't know you were going with him.

				JANE
		Did you bring your grey suit?

				AARON
		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

				JANE
			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

				JANE
		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

				AARON
		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

				JANE
			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

				JANE
			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

				JANE
		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

				AARON
		Really?

	Jane nods.

				AARON
		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

				JANE
		As good as humanly possible.

				AARON
		Yes.

				JANE
		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

				AARON
		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

				JANE
		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

				AARON
		If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

				JANE
		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

				AARON
		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

				JANE
		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

				AARON
		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

	INT. CAB - NIGHT

	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

				MAN ONE
		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

				MAN THREE
		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

				WOMAN
		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

				MAN
		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

	ON JANE

	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

	ON TOM

	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

	ON JANE

	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

	ON TOM

	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

				TOM
			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

				JANE
		Who?

				TOM
		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

				AARON
		Want to look at this?

				W.N.P.
		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

				GEORGE
			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

				AARON
			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

				GEORGE
		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

				W.N.P.
		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

				AARON
		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

				W.N.P.
		Sure.  You'll be fine.

				AARON
			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

				TOM
		How you doing, Paul?

				PAUL
		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

				TOM
		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

				PAUL
		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

				JANE
		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

				TOM
		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

				JANE
		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

				TOM
		Jane.

	She turns.

				TOM
		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

				JANE
		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

	ON TOM

	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

	FULL SHOT

	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten.

				AARON
		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

				AARON
			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Gee whiz.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

				AARON
		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

				AARON
		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

				AARON
		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

				AARON
		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Someone finds me some big towels.

	ON AARON

	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	ON MAKEUP WOMAN

	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

				DIRECTOR
		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

				TECHNICIAN
			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is more than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Can't you just die for him?

	ON MONITOR

	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Great.

	FULL SHOT

	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

				TOM
			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

				JANE
		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

				JANE
		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

				TOM
			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

				JANE
		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

				JANE
		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

				TOM
		Because you're nuts.

				JANE
		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

				TOM
		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

				JANE
		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

				TOM
		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

				JANE
			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

				TOM
		What?

				JANE
		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

				TOM
		That's not it.

				JANE
		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

				JANE
		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

				JANE
			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

				JANE
		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

				TOM
		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

				JANE
		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

				TOM
		JANE!

	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

				JANE
		What happened?

				TOM
		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

				JANE
		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

				TOM
		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

				JANE
		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

				AARON
		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				JANE
		How'd it go?

				AARON
		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

				JANE
		No.

				AARON
		Then it went well.

				JANE
		Did it really go well?

				AARON
		Define your terms.

				JANE
		Do you feel good about it?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Do others feel that you did well?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Then what was good about it?

				AARON
		I lost six pounds...

				JANE
		Aaron, will you tell me?

				AARON
		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

				JANE
		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

				AARON
		People phoned in.

				JANE
		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

				AARON
		I'm not kidding.

				JANE
		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

				AARON
		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

				JANE
		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

				AARON
		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

				JANE
		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

				JANE
		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

				AARON
		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

				JANE
			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

				AARON
			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

				AARON
		Don't go.

				JANE
		This is important to me.

				AARON
		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

				JANE
		What?

				AARON
			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

				AARON
		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

				JANE
			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

				AARON
		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

				JANE
		Yeah -- being a basket case.

				AARON
		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

				JANE
			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

				AARON
		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

				JANE
		I think you're the Devil.

				AARON
		No.  You know that I'm not.

				JANE
		How?

				AARON
		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

				JANE
		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

				AARON
		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

				AARON
			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

				JANE
			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

				AARON
		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	A woman walking from a car.

	ON TOM

	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

	INTERCUT:

	BACK TO SCENE

	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

				JANE
		Hi.  It's me.

				TOM
		Where are you?

				JANE
		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

				TOM
		Well, when?

				JANE
		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

				TOM
		I know.  I taped it.

				JANE
		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

				TOM
		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

				JANE
		Don't say anything about anything.

				AARON
		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

				TOM
		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

				AARON
		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

				TOM
		No.  Don't worry about it.

				AARON
		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

				JANE
		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

				TOM
		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

				JANE
		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

				TOM
		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

				JANE
			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

				TOM
			(finally)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Yes.

				TOM
		Okay.  Good night.

				JANE
			(aghast)
		Good night??!

				TOM
		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

				JANE
		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

				JANE
		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

				JANE
		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

				AARON
		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

				ERNIE
			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

				ERNIE
		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

				WIFE
		What?

				ERNIE
		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

				WIFE
			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

				BLAIR
		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

				BLAIR
		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

				JANE
		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

				BLAIR
		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The door now closed.

	JANE

	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

				TOM
		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

				JANE
			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

				TOM
		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

	TOM AND HIS DAD

				DAD
		You want my opinion?

				TOM
		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

				DAD
		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

				TOM
		Yes, I would.

				DAD
		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

				BILL
		Just when do you start, telling people?

				PAUL
		Almost immediately.

				BILL
		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

				PAUL
		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

				BILL
		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

				BLAIR
		Welcome back to Washington.

				BILL
		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

				BILL
		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

				BILL
		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

				PAUL
			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

				PAUL
		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

				BILL
		Hi.  It's about time.

				TOM
		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

	INSERT

	A great handshake.

	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

				TOM
		This is my father.

				BILL
		Good to meet you, sir.

	ON TOM

	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

				MR. GRUNICK
		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

				MR. GRUNICK
		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters...

				JANE
		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

				TOM
		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

				JANE
			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

				TOM
		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

				JANE
			(so softly)
		What?

				TOM
			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

				JANE
		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

				BLAIR
		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

				JANE
		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

				BOBBIE
		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

	INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

				SECRETARY
		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

				PAUL
		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

				PAUL
		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

				ANONYMOUS VOICE
		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

				TOM
		Have you guys seen Jane?

				ERNIE
		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

				AARON
		What did they do with you?

				TOM
		They booted me out of Washington.

				AARON
		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

				TOM
		Why?  What did they do to you?

				ERNIE
			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of
		him.

				AARON
		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

				ERNIE
		The cost-efficient reporter.

				AARON
		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

				TOM
		You packing up tonight?

				AARON
		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

				TOM
		London.

				AARON
			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

				TOM
			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

				AARON
		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

				TOM
		Hold it down, okay?

				AARON
		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

				TOM
		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

				AARON
		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

				AARON
		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

				TOM
			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

				TOM
		You know what I...

				AARON
		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

				OLDER SECRETARY
		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

				JANE
		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

				JANE
		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

				BLAIR
		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

				JANE
		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

				TOM
		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

				JANE
		How can you say that to me?

				TOM
		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

				JANE
		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

				TOM
		That's yes?

				JANE
		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings.  He answers.

				AARON
		Hello.

	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

				JANE
		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

				AARON
		Speaking.

				JANE
		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

				JANE
		Why not try it for a few weeks?

				AARON
		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

				JANE
		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

				AARON
		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

				JANE
		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

				AARON
		Let's go...

				JANE
		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

				AARON
		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

				JANE
		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

				AARON
		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

				JANE
			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

				AARON
		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

				JANE
		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

				AARON
		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

	As she inserts the tape into the player.

	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

	As she watches... this is what she sees...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

				TOM
		That's enough.  That's enough.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Are you okay?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Yes, I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

				TOM
		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		Tom

				TOM
		Yeah.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

				TOM
		Really?

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Yes, it is.

				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

				TOM
			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

				JANE
			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

				TOM
		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

				JANE
		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

				TOM
		Why?

				JANE
		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

				TOM
		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

				JANE
			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

				TOM
		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

				JANE
			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

				TOM
			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

				JANE
		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

				TOM
		I got promoted for things like that.

				JANE
		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

				TOM
		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

				JANE
			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

				TOM
		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

				JANE
			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

				TOM
			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

	INT. TERMINAL - DAY

	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

	INT. METAL DETECTOR

	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

				TICKET AGENT
			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

				JANE
		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

				TOM
			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

				JANE
		I don't wan to discuss work.

				TOM
		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

				JANE
		I knew what you meant.

				TOM
		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

				JANE
		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

				TOM
		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

				JANE
		It's okay.

				TICKET AGENT
		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

				JANE
		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

				TOM
			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

				JANE
			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

				TOM
			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

				JANE
			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

				TOM
		Take it easy.

				JANE
		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

				TOM
		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

	ON JANE

	Watching him go.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

	Jane gets quickly into cab.

				CABBIE
		Good morning.

				JANE
		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

				JANE
		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

				JANE
		But New York Avenue's faster.

							FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

	ON TOM

	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

				TOM
		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

				TOM
		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

				LILA
			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

				AARON
		Hi.

				TOM
		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

				BOY
		Clifford...

				AARON
			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

				BOY
		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

				AARON
		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

				TOM
		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

				AARON
		Okay.

				TOM
			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

				LILA
			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

				LILA
		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

				AARON
		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

				TOM
		I appreciate it.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

	ON JANE

	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

				TOM
		A picnic?

				JANE
		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

				AARON
		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

				AARON
		He excels at gratitude.

				TOM
			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

				JANE
		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

				AARON
		Really?

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

				TOM
		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

				JANE
		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

				TOM
		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

				JANE
		I'm sorry because I was looking
		forward to that, but I' m going
		back in a few hours.

				TOM
		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

				TOM
			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

				AARON
		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

				TOM
		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

				AARON
		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

	ON JANE

	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

				TOM
			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

				AARON
			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

				TOM
			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

				AARON
		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

				JANE
		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been 
		getting me into water skiing.

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

				JANE
		I like it!  So, doll, what about you
		lately?

				AARON
		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
	their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

							FADE OUT.
FADE IN

	EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

	A restaurant supply truck is curbside, near a small 
	restaurant.  GERALD GRUNICK, forty-one, is closing the back 
	door of his truck, feeling good about the world, a common
	state for him.  He moves towards the cab of the truck and gets
	inside as we SUPER:

		KANSAS CITY, MO. - 1963

	INT. TRUCK - DAY

	As he sits down beaming over his recent good fortune... now we
	REVEAL his twelve-year-old son, TOM, seated quietly beside him. 
	He seems a bit down.  Gerald glances at his son.

				GERALD
		I don't know a recent Saturday I've
		sold more.  You didn't think I'd
		sell that health restaurant, did you?

				TOM
		No.  Not even you.

				GERALD
		Why so glum?

				TOM
		I don't know.

				GERALD
			(a beat)
		Go ahead.

				TOM
		No, nothing.  I've got a problem,
		I guess.

				GERALD
		Were you bothering by those
		waitresses making a fuss?

				TOM
		No.  But, honest.  What are you
		supposed to say when they keep
		talking about your looks?  I don't
		even know what they mean -- "Beat
		them off with a stick."

	Gerald stiffs a grin.

				GERALD
		You know, Tom, I feel a little
		proud when people comment on your
		looks.  Maybe you should feel that
		way.

				TOM
		Proud?  I'm just embarrassed that
		I like when they say those things.

				GERALD
		As long as that's your only problem
		you're...

				TOM
		It's not.

	He looks directly at his father and talks quietly, and sincerely.

				TOM
		I got my report card.  Three Cs,
		two Ds and an incomplete.

				GERALD
		Oh my.  I see you studying so hard,
		Tom.  What do you think the problem is?

				TOM
		I'll just have to try harder.  I don't 
		know.  I will.
			(talking himself
			 into it)
		I will.  I will.  I will.

	He shakes his head for emphasis, glad he's received this pep
	talk from himself -- he hands the card to his father.

				TOM
		Thanks, Dad, this talk helped.  Will 
		you sign it, please?

				GERALD
			(as he signs)
		Would it help if I got you a tutor?

				TOM
			(suddenly hopeful)
		That would be great.
			(worried)

	BOSTON, MASS. - 1965

	INT. HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY

	AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his
	graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory.  He is a
	rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

				AARON
		...and finally to the teachers of
		Whitman High School, I don't have the
		words to express my gratitude which
		may have more to say about the quality 
		of the English Department here than 
		my own limitations...

	He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective
	discomfort.

				AARON
		...that was, of course, not meant to
		be taken seriously.  A personal note.  
		I am frequently asked what the special 
		difficulties are in being graduated 
		from High School two months shy of my 
		fifteenth birthday.  I sometimes 
		think it was the difficulties 
		themselves which enabled me to do it.
		If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated
		I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to
		graduate.  I hope the next student who
		comes along and is able to excel isn't
		made to feel so much an outcast.  But
		I'm looking forward to college; this is
		the happiest day I've had in a long
		time.  I thank you and I forgive you.

	This is very little applause.

	ANGLE ON TEACHERS

				MALE TEACHER
		I'm always so confused by Aaron.
		Is he brave and earnest or just
		a conceited little dick-head?

	BACK TO AARON AS WE SUPER: "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS REPORTER"

	ANGLE ON STAGE

	As Aaron walks to his seat past three full grown tough looking
	semi-literate high school graduates.

				YOUTH #1
		Later, Aaron.

	EXT. SCHOOL YARD - DAY

	Clusters of graduates at the fence bordering the sunken school
	yard looking down as the tough cap and gowners seen earlier
	cuff Aaron around.

	CLOSER IN

	Aaron feeling from a blow -- his lip bleeding -- his teeth
	covered with blood...as he gets to his feet.  He is livid --
	something primal triggered by this brutality.

				AARON
		Go ahead, Stephen -- take your
		last licks.
			(points at his
			 face)
		But this will heal -- what I'm
		going to say to you will scar you
		forever.  Ready?  Here it is.

	He dodges as they come after him.  They catch him by the hair
	and hurl him to the ground.  As he gets up he hurls his
	devastating verbal blow.

				AARON
		You'll never make more than
		nineteen thousand dollars a year.
		Ha ha ha.

	They twist his arm and grip him -- his face scraped on the
	concrete.

				AARON
		Okay, take this:  You'll never
		leave South Boston and I'm going
		to see the whole damn world.  You'll
		never know the pleasure of writing
		a graceful sentence or having an
		original thought.  Think about it.

	He's punched in the stomach and sinks to the ground.  As the
	Young Toughs walk off Aaron catches a phrase of their
	conversation.

				YOUTH TOUGH
		Nineteen thousand dollars...
		Not bad.

	FADE IN

	ATLANTA, GEORGIA - 1968

	INT. SUBURBAN HOME - NIGHT

	JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing.  Above the
	desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and
	pictures tacked to each one.  Her desk has several file racks
	which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes --
	a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side.  Jane types
	very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

				JANE
			(voice over; as
			 she types)
		Dear Felatzia, it's truly amazing
		to me that we live a world apart
		and yet have the same favorite music.
		I loved the picture you sent and
		have it up on my bulletin board.
		You're growing so much faster than
		I am that I...

	OTHER ANGLE

	SHOWING Jane's FATHER standing near the door.

				JANE
			(voice over)
		...am starting to get jealous.
		I read in the newspapers about
		the Italian strike and riots in
		Milan.  I hope you weren't...

				FATHER
			(softly)
		Honey?...

	Jane SCREAMS, and grabs her heart, breathing heavily, babbles
	nervously at her Dad.

				JANE
		Oh God -- Daddy -- don't...don't...
		don't ever scare me like that --
		please.

	We SUPER:  "FUTURE NETWORK NEWS PRODUCER"

	Her father is himself taken aback with the shock of her reaction.
	Falling back towards the door:

				FATHER
		Jane -- For God's sake...
			(recovering)
		Look, it's time for you to go
		to sleep.

				JANE
		I just have two more pen pals and
		then I'm done.

				FATHER
		You don't have to finish tonight.

				JANE
			(he doesn't get in)
		Nooo.  This way the rotation stays
		the same.

				FATHER
		Finish quickly.  I don't want you
		getting obsessive about these 
		things.  Good night.

	We REMAIN WITH Jane who has obviously become disconcerted and
	troubled.

	INT. HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane moves to room at the other end of the hall -- a family
	room where her Father reads the latest Rolling Stone of the
	mid-60's -- Hunter Thompson, the New Journalism, the slim
	Jann Wenner -- Jane bursts into the room.

				JANE
		Dad, you want me to choose my words
		so carefully and then you just throw
		a word like 'obsessive' at me.  Now,
		unless I'm wrong and...
			(enunciating)
		...please correct me if I am, 'obsession'
		is practically a psychiatric term...
		concerning people who don't have anything
		else but the object of their obsession --
		who can't stop and do anything else.  Well,
		Here I am stopping to tell you this.  Okay?
		So would you please try and be a little
		more precise instead of calling a person
		something like 'obsessive.'

	She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out,
	even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had
	enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from 
	the room.  She exits the room INTO BLACK.

	Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

	OVER EXT. SMALL MID-WESTERN CITY - DAY

	Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a
	twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a
	jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind
	of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours.  The
	Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important
	news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else
	yet never mention.  She stops running as she feeds quarters into
	the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven
	different papers before moving on.

	INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	As she enters from the bathroom, having showered and dressed.
	The sun is jus now rising.  She sits next to her phone.

	INSERT:  JANE'S ROOM

	The Filofax book is almost an additional character -- a crucial
	hand-fashioned tool of Jane's trade.  She flicks at a page --
	takes down a typewritten sheet scotch-taped to it showing the
	room number of her crew and reporter.

	ON JANE

	As she dials one room number.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Hi...It's me...

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY

	ANGLE ON CAMERAMAN -- his equipment in evidence though
	essentially asleep holding his bedmate's hand, as he listens
	to Jane.

				JANE'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		It's thirty minutes before you have
		to meet me in the lobby -- nudge
		your wife.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		There's probably no time to eat...
		but there's a cafeteria at the bus
		depot once we get down there.  I
		love working with you two...It 
		saves me a call.

	She dales.

	INT. DUPLICATE MOTEL ROOM

	Where Aaron is switching his TV from station to station,
	monitoring the early morning news.  His PHONE RINGS.

				AARON
		Hi.  Turn on your TV...
		Good Morning America, the
		Morning News and Today are all
		about to talk to Arnold 
		Schwarzenegger and I think he's 
		live on at least two of them.

	BACK TO SCENE

				JANE
		At six o'clock on the wake-up
		news they used the wrong missile
		graphic.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Now listen, Arnold just said that
		he's been making three million a
		movie now.  But he's not ever 
		gonna change.  He's still the same
		person when he was making two 
		million dollars a movie.  He feels
		no different.  He also bought a brand-
		new condo with Maria, they gonna
		furnish tastefully.

				JANE
		A half hour in the lobby.

				AARON
			(Austrian accent)
		Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies [sic].

	She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the
	bed for a moment's solitude.  She sits stiffly, palms on top of
	her legs.  It looks like someone with unusually good posture,
	waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs
	redden and she begins to cry.  Now she sobs -- then miraculously
	shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom.  This crying
	episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

	INT. BUS STATION - DAY

	Jane standing behind her husband-wife - camera-sound team
	as they train their attention on Aaron; who is getting ready to 
	do a stand-up.  There is a DERELICT off to one side.  Aaron holds 
	his microphone at the ready.

				AARON
		Ready.
 
				CAMERAMAN
		Your hair's a little funny.

				AARON
		It's an ethnic curl, I can't do
		anything about it.

				CAMERAMAN
		In front of a little -- it's a bit...
		You want a mirror?

				AARON
		No -- Don't worry about it.  Let's
		do this.

	Jane nods her assent.

				CAMERAMAN
		Okay.

	AARON SEEN THROUGH CAMERA

				AARON
		In other times, for other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  He...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		I'm sorry.  But look at how
		wonderful his face is.

	She points to the derelict.

				AARON
		Oh, you mean use him...That's
		nice.  Okay.

				CAMERAMAN
		I'll put him in the low corner of
		the frame -- good.

				AARON
		In other times, with other purposes,
		there might be a band and bunting
		here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's
		return from war.  Last week he was
		decorated by a president for heroism
		in a war.  But it was the civil war --
		in Angola -- and he was in it for the
		money.

	He puts the microphone down.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	He passes a vending machine and checks the stray hair.

	INT. GATE AREA - DAY

	Jane in the distant b.g. on the phone.  Aaron and crew shooting
	as the bus pulls up, hisses to a stop and tired, rumpled
	passengers exit the bus.  J.D. SINGER, strong, 9'6" figure
	emerges and is displeased to find a camera trained on him.
	He reacts with all the grace of a short mercenary.

				J.D.
		Go 'way.

	J.D. gets his luggage from the compartment under the bus.  The
	crew shooting.

				AARON
		Just a few questions?

				J.D.
		No.

	He starts walking -- the four person newsteam staying with him.

				AARON
		We came from Washington.

				J.D.
		Move away from me.

				AARON
			(holding out
			 microphone)
		How long has it been since you've
		been home.

				J.D.
			(moving)
		Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuck.  Fuckes.  Snot...
		Fuckee.  You want to use that?

				AARON
		It depends on how big a news day it 
		is.

	They reach Jane.  She calls to him.

				JANE
		J.D.  I'm Jane Craig.  I spoke to
		you in Angola.  I gave you some
		sugarless gum and Handi-Wipes.

	As he reacts to her:

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane sitting next to Aaron making detailed timing notes as she
	screens the material shot that day on a portable monitor unit.

				AARON
		Where's where I asked him about
		being scared?
			(then)
		You should work on your speech.

				JANE
		No.  It makes me nervous to think
		about it.  Let's do this.

	She consults her notes and goes back to the exact spot.

				AARON
			(on tape)
		All this business of war -- do you
		get scared?

				J.D.
			(on tape; he smiles)
		Uh-uh.
			(then)
		I'm a little freaked right now about
		seeing my father though.

	He laughs self-consciously and turns briefly away.

				JANE
		I love that turn away.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Jane is at the lectern in the darkened auditorium as two large
	monitors display some taped news pieces she has assembled.  On
	the lectern is a sign telling us we are at the Conference of
	Local Television News Broadcasters.

				JANE
			(in darkness)
		There's a point I'm trying to make
		about these pieces coming up.

	A WOMAN'S OUTLINE blacked out from behind -- her VOICE
	ELECTRICALLY DISGUISED.

				WOMAN
			(o.s.; angrily)
		I don't think any client of mine
		makes less than fifty thousand dollars
		a year which means they can afford the
		best and you're damn right I feel good
		that that includes me.

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - ANOTHER WOMAN
	in blackness, her VOICE DISGUISED.

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		No.  You'd be surprised at who a
		working girl meets.  I've been a
		working girl for what? -- over a year
		anyway and that must be a thousand
		men and I don't think there's an age
		or type that hasn't been in there.

				INTERVIEWER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		Policemen?  -- Doctor? -- Lawyer...?

				WOMAN TWO
			(o.s.)
		Oh, sure.  Television reporters.

	A laugh from the audience.  There is a:

							CUT TO:

	ANOTHER ANGLE - FULL FIGURE
	A WOMAN in blackness.

				WOMAN THREE
			(o.s.)
		I'm seventeen now and I've been
		working the streets for two years
		and I guess to be honest -- I stopped
		thinking of it as temporary.

	The lights come up on the room.  The two screens go black...
	there is general APPLAUSE.  Jane blinks nervously.

				JANE
		Please don't applaud.

	ON AUDIENCE

	Sitting in groups of three -- NEWS TEAM from around the country,
	remarkably similar in comparison...a great looking woman, good
	looking man (either young or attractively avuncular) and a Black
	or Hispanic.  They still APPLAUD -- not yet having grasped the
	sincerity of Jane's plea which she presses with more urgency.

				JANE
		Please.  Don't!!
			(she yells)
		I gathered these pieces as an
		example of what's WRONG with local
		television news.

	The applause stops.

				JANE
		The excerpts from THREE SEPARATE
		SERIES on prostitution were
		SIMULTANEOUSLY broadcast by all
		stations in one city during sweeps
		week.  By what bend of either or
		suspension of duty is that broadcast
		news?

	She pauses half a beat for possible applause -- hearing none,
	she continues.  An anchorman sneezes -- four people shout
	"gesundheit" simultaneously -- they laugh.

				JANE
		The legacy of Edward R. Murrow,
		Eric Sevareid, William Shirer,
		David Brinkley and Walter Cronkite
		is being squandered in a desperate
		popularity contest.  Our profession
		is in danger:

	TRACKING SHOT

	As Jane continues, REVEALING that the news team now have even
	more in common.  They do not like Jane.

				JANE
		Yesterday's compliment has somehow
		managed to become today's kiss of
		death.  To be considered a serious
		journalist is no longer flattering.
		It presents the risk of being labeled
		ponderous, or worse yet, elitest, 
		right?

	SHOT CONTINUES

	Women playing with their hair, young man bored...one
	middle-aged anchorman fusses with a spot on his tie...

	ON JANE

	Briefly departing from text.

				JANE
		All of you know what I'm talking about.  
		We're all trying to act together than 
		we are.  But we care.  So, we're all 
		secretly terrified, aren't we?

	Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her
	prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice
	begins to rasp.

				JANE
		We are being increasingly influenced
		by the star system.  The network
		anchormen are so powerful they 
		compromise our last best hope.  The 
		current group is clearly qualified, 
		tied still to our best traditions, but 
		who follows these men?

	TRACKING SHOT MOVES TO TOM GRUNICK

	Seated with other members of his news team, a young blonde
	woman whose hand is resting on his inner leg, a good looking
	Hispanic.  Tom feels a growing excitement -- Jane is not just
	a speaker, she seems a savior.

				TOM
		Wow.

	His female colleague looks at him.

				FEMALE COLLEAGUE
		Oh, I've known so many women like
		that.  They don't like their looks
		so they're angry.

	BACK TO JANE

	Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would
	wish.

				JANE
		I was going to talk about other
		trends but...
			(mumbling)
		...the magazine shows, news at
		profit, influence of
		Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the
		hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I
		was going to show you a tape -- a story
		that was carried by all networks on the
		same night -- the same night -- not one
		network noted a major policy change in
		Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks...
		Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. 
		Show the tape.

	ON MONITORS

	Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all
	networks in the Spring of 1985.  It is quite spectacular -- the
	dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny
	bridges, setting off little fireworks.  JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds
	loudly and squeals with delight.

	ON SCENE

	Jane between the two monitors.  She begins to speak loudly OVER
	the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.

				JANE
			(loudly)
		I know it's good film.  I know it's
		fun.  I like fun.  It's just not news.
			(as they continue
			 to applaud)
		Well, you're lucky you love it --
		you're going to get a lot more just
		like it.

	STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"

	OTHER ANGLE

	Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event.
	Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart.  She takes
	some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.

	WIDER

	Tom the last person remaining in the room.  He approaches her --
	she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually
	mounts the stage with an athletic leap.  It takes courage for
	Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:

				TOM
		Hello.

	She looks up at him.

	ANGLE ON TOM

	Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage
	there it is.

				JANE
		Hi.

				TOM
		I just wanted to tell you  how great 
		you were.  My name's Tom Grunick.

				JANE
			(dumbly)
		Thank you.
			(then)
		They hated me.  I don't hate them.

				TOM
		Well, they say if you can reach
		even one person, it means something...
		And you did that.

	Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:

				JANE
		Would you like to have dinner
		with me?

	INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand.  She has attempted to dress
	up to the extent that  packing for a short-day trip allows.  She
	looks for Tom.  Tom rises from a table and is immediately at
	her side.

				JANE
		Hi.  I was worried I was early.

				TOM
		I was a lot earlier.

	They are lead to a table and sit down.

				TOM
		I kept thinking what a great break
		it was for me to get to see you
		tonight.  More than a great break,
		maybe just what I needed...just when
		I needed it...Angel of mercy --
		godsend...lifesaver...what?

				JANE
			(picking one)
		I like "godsend."

				TOM
		I haven't been in news that long.
		I've just been looking for the
		right person to talk to.  I have
		about two thousand questions for you.

	He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it
	continues to rest.  He looks at her a beat.

				TOM
		It's possible now's not the right
		time.

	She lifts her head.

				JANE
		If we could just eat first.

				TOM
		Totally understood.  Totally
		wrong of me to talk shop after
		the day you've had.  Totally
		sorry.

				JANE
		Nooo.  If I could just have a
		roll, I'd be okay.

	She takes a roll from the roll plate.  He smiles at her.  She
	takes a bite.

				JANE
		Thank you.

	EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT

	As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously.
	Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little
	adrift and temporarily free of obligations.  She is open to
	making a memorable mistake.

				JANE
		Another thing I can't stand --
		Is this dull?

	Tom shakes his head almost violently.

				TOM
		No, no, no, no...

	Jane looks at him curiously -- then:

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Another thing I can't stand is
		...when White House reporters
		bullshit with each other after
		a briefing and then one of them
		has a theory and the other quotes
		it in his story as "White House"
		sources say...

				TOM
		That actually goes on...

				JANE
		Yes.  My room is down here --
		I'm not tired.  Do you want to
		keep talking?

				TOM
		Yes, sure.

	INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT

	A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in
	evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized
	notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed --
	Tom, not far away in the room's only chair.  One lamp is on
	and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an
	enormously flattering light.  MUSIC comes from her miniature
	portable STEREO system.

				JANE
		Come on...Even I'm not that
		hard on myself.

				TOM
		No, I really got this job on a
		fluke and wait till you hear where
		it ends up.

	Jane smiles a calming smile.

				JANE
		I was doing sports at the station.
		The newspaper ran this untrue story
		that I was leaving and they got all
		these tons of protest mail.  So they
		made me anchor.

				JANE
		So great -- right?

				TOM
		Except I'm no good at what I'm being
		a success at.

				JANE
		How are you at back rubs?

	Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is
	immobilized by the sudden turn.  Jane waits, just a bit longer
	than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before
	experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection.  She moves
	briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate
	from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.

				JANE
		It's sort of normal -- the way you
		feel.  In graduate school everyone
		thought the only mistake the
		admission committee made was letting
		them in.

	He moves to the bed.

				TOM
		Listen to me.  You keep on thinking
		I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence.
		That's not it.  I know I can talk well
		enough and I'm not bad at making contact
		with people, but I don't like the 
		feeling that I'm pretending to be a 
		reporter.
			(cont'd)
		And half the time I don't really get 
		the news I'm talking about.  It isn't
		that I'm down on myself.  Trust me,
		I stink.

				JANE
			(levelly)
		I trust you.

				TOM
		I didn't even have the chance to get
		really good at sports.  I wasn't bad.
		I thought I was starting to do
		interesting features but hockey is
		big at the station and...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		What about the obvious remedy?
		Reversing things.  Maybe getting a
		job on a newspaper.

				TOM
		I don't write.

	Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.

				TOM
		But that didn't stop me from
		sending out audition tapes to
		bigger stations and the networks.

				JANE
		Well, come on -- it is your life.
		Nobody is tying you to the fast
		track.  Did you go to college?

				TOM
		One year...almost one year.

				JANE
		So, you're not well educated and
		you have almost no experience and
		you can't write.

	He nods agreement.

				TOM
		And I'm making a fortune.

	Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with
	her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy.  She gets off
	the bed.

				JANE
		It's hard for me to advise you
		since you personify something that
		I truly think is dangerous.

				TOM
		Uh-huh.

				JANE
			(holding it in)
		I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
			(letting it out)
		So get qualified.  You can insist on
		being better prepared.  You don't have
		to just leave it as...
			(mimicking him)
		'I don't write.  I'm not schooled.
		I don't understand the news I'm reading.
		But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'

	A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.

				TOM
		Whoa, this was a mistake.

				JANE
		Just what do you want from me, anyway?
		Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining
		and do something about it.

	He gets up to leave.  She follows him.

				JANE
		Well, you don't have to start right now.

	He turns to her.

				TOM
		I hated the way you talked to me just
		now...and it wasn't just because you
		were right.

	He exits.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She is on the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No.  It wasn't just the speech --
		the same thing happened with this
		guy.  I have passed some line some
		place.  I am beginning to repel people
		I'm trying to seduce.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As he talks with Jane.

				AARON
			(agreeably)
		He must have been great-looking, right?

				JANE
		Why do you say that?

				AARON
		Because nobody invites a bad-
		looking idiot to their bedroom.

	She smiles.

				AARON
		Okay.  Let's do me.

				JANE
		Sure.

				AARON
		Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but
		do people who are actually slipping
		feel that way or is it always the
		really good people who are moving up
		who invariably think they're slipping
		because their standards are so high?

				JANE
		This conversation is not worthy of you.

				AARON
		I'd give anything if that were true.

				JANE
			(laughing)
		Good night.

				AARON
		Wouldn't this be a great world if
		insecurity and desperation made us
		more attractive?  If needy were a
		turn-on?

				JANE
		Call if you get weird.

	INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

	She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed --
	on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes.  She doesn't 
	clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work.  
	The PHONE RINGS.

				JANE
			(answering)
		I was just thinking it was the
		shortest phone conversation we
		ever had.

	EXT. PHONE BOOTH

	A deserted well-lit area.  Tom on the phone.

				TOM
		I never told you the reason I was
		telling you everything for.

				JANE
			(pleasantly surprised
			 it's him)
		Hey?

	INTERCUT:

	ON TOM

				TOM
		Those audition tapes I sent out...
		I've been hired by your network for
		the Washington bureau.  So I'll
		probably see you at work.  Sorry.

	Jane is rocked and soured.

				JANE
		What???

	EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

	Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

				AARON
		They didn't hire Peter Stiller from
		the Times and he had a great
		audition tape.

				JANE
		You want to start going over who they
		could have gotten?  They can't take on
		people like this for network news.  For
		God's sake.  What's going on?

	INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

	Tom arrives for first day of work.

	INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE

	ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief.  He
	is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years
	-- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man,
	a good guy.  Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network
	thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he
	holds dear.  As he hands Tom his credentials:

				ERNIE
		Any particular area you feel
		strongest in?

				TOM
		To be honest, I was best at anchor.

	Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?

				ERNIE
		Why don't you take a few days observing
		the system?  Then we'll put you on
		general assignment.

	EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room.  Jane goes over her
	timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the
	monitors.  BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing
	Jane's bidding.  On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece
	which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline.  The
	PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations
	which continuing to edit.  The pressure is palpable to begin
	with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting
	out of hand and threatening to bend lives.  Through it all, Jane
	remains remarkable calm.  Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.

				JANE
			(consulting notes)
		Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound
		bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I
		don't know how I'll feel...'

				BOBBIE
		We could...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.

	As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in
	the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room --
	Jane's eyes click to him briefly.  She makes not a move to
	welcome him.  He pauses, but is committed and tries to find
	a piece for himself against the wall.

				TOM
		They said I should observe the...

	Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.

				TOM
		They said it would be okay if...

				JANE
			(incredulous)
		We're working here!!  You can stand
		over in the uh, uh, uh...

	She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.'  Then back
	to Bobbie:

				JANE
		Play back the last line...

				BOBBIE
		He said something about...

				JANE
			(sharply)
		Let me hear it!

	Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing,
	yet still repressed resentment.

	The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room.
	She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as
	Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.

				BLAIR
		We'll need it in ten minutes.  We're
		putting it directly into...

	Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a
	ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Craig, just a second --
			(to Bobbie)
		Let me hear it!

	Through much of this chaos we focus on:

	TOM

	Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks --
	He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear.  His eyes
	dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can,
	always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.

				MERCENARY
			(voice over)
		It's been a long time since I've seen
		my folks and all but...I don't expect
		any big-deal homecoming.

				JANE
		Stop there.
			(into phone she's
			 been holding)
		I want to shoot a picture from
		a book I have in the office.

				BLAIR
		You don't have time.  Not a chance.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		I'll be right down.  It's right tight.

	She crosses out.

				BLAIR
		I've got to tell Ernie...because
		there isn't enough time.

				JANE
		Yes, there is.

	Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes.  She charges out
	leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.

				TOM
		I'm Tom Grunick.  I started on
		General Assignment today.

	Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands.
	Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.

				BOBBIE
		I don't think she's going to make it.

	Tom exits.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM

	Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and
	JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer
	beauties in news.  She is well-schooled, bred, trained and
	known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and
	MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration --
	State Department correspondent for the network.

				KLEIN
		Okay, what about this?  Here's a
		tough ethical one.  Would you tell
		a source that you loved them just
		to get some information?

				AARON
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		Yes.

				ERNIE
		Me too.

				JENNIFER
		Sure.

				AARON
		Jennifer didn't know there
		was an alternative.

	Jennifer laughs that laugh one always hopes beautiful women
	will laugh when one says something funny.  Aaron smiles at her.

				AARON
		Here's one.  They allow us to have
		cameras at an execution in Florida.
		Do you broadcast tape of the guy  in
		the chair when they turn on the
		voltage?

				KLEIN
		Sure.

				JENNIFER
		Why not?

				ERNIE
		Absolutely.

				GEORGE
		You bet.

				AARON
		Nothing like wrestling with a
		moral dilemma is there?

	Blair enters the scene, Tom trailing several feet behind,
	continuing to monitor the budding deadline crises.

				BLAIR
		Excuse me, Ernie, we're several minutes
		to air and Jane's shooting an insert
		still for tonight's piece.

				ERNIE
		She knows how much time she has.

	Blair flashes a tortured smile -- panic is growing.

				BLAIR
		Okay.  I just wanted you to know.

				AARON
		What is she shooting?

				BLAIR
		Norman Rockwell's 'Homecoming.'

				AARON
			(thinks then)
		Oh, that's nice...
			(walking away)
		We'll need some new lines.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

	Jane up against it now -- but still seemingly calm.  Tom
	watching, keeps on glancing at the clock fascinated,
	impressed.

				JANE
		Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second
		dissolve to the Rockwell.

				BOBBIE
		Should I...

				JANE
			(interrupting)
		Just a two-second dissolve.

				BLAIR
			(hurting)
		Oh, Jesus, we have three minutes...
		Why do you do this to me.  Is it
		because I won an award?

	INT. RECORDING BOOTH - NIGHT

	Where Aaron is writing his last line on a folded over piece of
	paper even as he gets ready to record.  He times it with a
	stop watch.

				AARON
		Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait
		of a Homecoming  The return of a
		fighting man has always been one of
		the more moving ceremonies of war...
		Tearful women, proud men, excited
		children.  But J.D. Singer was right --
		his homecoming was no big deal.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - NIGHT

				BLAIR
		We have a minute and a half.  It's my
		responsibility to tell them we won't
		be ready.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.  We're be ready.

	Blair glances frantically at her watch.

				BLAIR
		In 84 seconds?

	ON CLOCK

	Sweeping from 28 minutes to -- 84 seconds from deadline.  Aaron
	walks in, Jane looks up.

				JANE
			(hopefully)
		Nine seconds.

				AARON
		Eleven and a half.

				JANE
		Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?

	ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS DIALOGUE FOLLOWS.  IT BUILDS UNTIL IT
	DUPLICATE THE SOUND OF LOUD AND BAWDY SEX.

				BLAIR
		You're saying 'Oh, God..."  They are
		going to go to up and the screen will
		be black -- they're going to go to black
		because we're not there.  How about
		careers, huh?  How about careers?

	ON CLOCK

	42 seconds away.

				BLAIR
		We're not going to make it.

	Bobbie makes a small bobble -- Jane giving the merest evidence
	of the strain, scratching her face repeatedly.

				BOBBIE
		Whoops.

				BLAIR
			(unravelling)
		Whoops?!?  Whoops?!?  No, please...
		no, ooh, ahhh, ohhh.

				AARON
		Shit, shit, shit...

				TOM
			(caught up)
		You're almost there, you can do it --
		can do -- can do.

	And as the pitch reaches its zenith, 27 seconds left.  Bobbie
	hands the tape to Blair.

				BOBBIE
		Ready.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.

	VARIOUS SHOTS

	Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a
	chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight,
	the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting
	elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps
	nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels
	down the long corridor heading to the control room where she
	arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is
	introduced on the air.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the
	air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

				BLAIR
		I was a little nervous there for
		a minute.

				AARON
		Oh, come on -- tell us another.

	ON MONITOR

	The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the
	mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait.  The 
	irony works nicely.  The network anchorman comes up for his close.  
	BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses.  
	He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a 
	journalistic king.

				BILL
			(on monitor, smiling)
		Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

				JENNIFER
		Look at that smile.  Oh, that was
		good and oh my, Bill smiled -- he
		liked it.

				AARON
		He loved it.  Big smile.

	He gives Jane a congratulatory sock in the shoulder which she
	returns -- Tom in the b.g. of the SHOT.

				BLAIR
		I haven't seen Bill smile like that
		in weeks.

	Ernie has walked a few steps to the office.

				BLAIR
		Ernie, you missed his close... He smiled.
			(mimicking)
		Thank you...Good night.

	She smiles.

				ERNIE
		I saw the smile -- good piece.

				AARON
		I'm gonna go look at it again.

	They leave -- Aaron waving to Tom who stands in the b.g.  The
	others leave.  Tom approaches Jane.

				TOM
		I'm sorry if I was in the way.  It
		was totally impressive.  Great piece.

				JANE
			(somewhat formal)
		You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it
		feel being here?

				TOM
		I can't believe I'm really here.  No
		kidding.  If you're through work now --

				JANE
		No.  Aaron and I go to Central America
		on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.

				TOM
		I thought you were incredible in there.
		I know how much I have to learn.  I'd
		really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...

				JANE
		'Really a lot appreciate it...'

				TOM
		You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I
		can pick your brain --

	Jane grimaces at "pick your brain."

				JANE
		I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not
		here to teach remedial reporting.

				TOM
		And it has nothing to do with the fact
		I left your room instead of staying 
		there?

	Jane looks at him.

				JANE
		Oh, please.
			(then, almost gently)
		You're gonna have to understand
		something.  This isn't personal.

	She exits.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING

	As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep
	in their own conversation.  Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS
	they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.

				AARON
		I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less
		and less air time.  They don't think
		I'm at all anchor material.

				JANE
		If we don't get to their camp soon,
		we won't be able to tape the supplies
		coming in.

				AARON
		Last time Paul was sick they gave
		Connie the weekend news instead of me.

				JANE
		You spend too much time -- much too
		much worrying about that crap...
			(suddenly reacting)
		Oh good.

	They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped,
	the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots
	inside.

	ANGLE ON

	A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot.  A pair of new boots 
	sit alongside him.  Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in 
	Spanish, then English:

				CAMERAMAN
		Put on the boot.

	Jane rushes into the scene incensed.

				JANE
		Stop!  We are not here to stage the news.
		Wait and see what he does.

	Then to the totally confused soldier.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Sir, you do whatever you want.  It's
		your choice.

	By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as
	the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to
	what is expected.  He looks to Jane, who can offer no help
	save her own determination not to interfere.  Finally he puts
	on the boot.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.

	He shoots the scene.

	INT. HAY ADAMS HOTEL

	Tom, in shirt and tie, is on the phone.  This is a big day.

				TOM
		Okay, I'll meet the crew there then.
		Could you give me that address again?
		Great.  Yes, it's good to finally be
		getting to work.  Okay that's
		17204?  1-7-2-0-4.  Thanks.

	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY

	As Tom gets directions from the CONCIERGE.

				CONCIERGE
		It's only ten minutes if you prefer
		to walk...
			(as he walks away)
		I'll look for you on the news tonight.

	EXT. HOTEL - DAY

	Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived.  The
	strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off
	to cover his first story.  He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

	EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - LATER AFTERNOON

	Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish
	to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

				AARON (in Spanish)
		Are you guys kidding or do you really
		think you'll run into something...?
		I mean, do you feel that every time
		and it never happens?  Or is it the
		first time it felt that way and it's
		going to happen?... I mean, how bad
		can it be?... Are you nervous...?
		What's the chances on a scale of one
		to ten -- that we're going to be in
		a war within the next few hours?...
		Really?

	He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was
	talking with calling after him with an added thought.

				AARON
		Thanks, you speak English very well
		too.
			(to Jane)
		Great news.  He says they've been
		engaging the Sandinistas pretty
		regularly and that he'd be really
		surprised if we didn't take fire 
		tonight.

	Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration.  Aaron is amazed at her
	attitude.

				AARON
		Look at her.
			(to Jane)
		If anything happens to me tell every
		woman I've ever dated I was talking
		about them at the end.  That way they'll
		have to reevaluate me.

	Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention.
	Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish.  The Guerrillas laugh.

	EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT

	Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas.  They HEAR A SHOT.
	The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men.  Aaron
	grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left.  As they run --
	more SHOTS.  Jane in work mode.  As soon as they settle.

				JANE
		Let's tape.

				CAMERAMAN
			(Spanish accent)
		Much too dark.  Black.

				JANE
		That's okay.

	ON AARON BARELY DISCERNIBLE

	As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of
	the nearly gunfire.

				AARON
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.  The Contras feel they
		must be outnumbered this is so small
		a unit:  that's a given.  Still they
		hold their ground despite the fact
		that their weapons have been acting
		up -- misfiring or jamming.  A new
		shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow --
		all they got today were the shoes.

	There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

				JANE
			(to Cameraman)
		Okay.
			(to Aaron)
		Great line at the end.

				AARON
		Did you shoot their boots?

				JANE
		Of course.

				AARON
		We can cut back at the end.

				JANE
		To the pan of the supplies boxes --

				AARON
		Can you believe it?  I just risked my
		life for a network that tests my face
		with focus groups.

	EXT. GOVERNMENT BLDG - AFTERNOON

	Tom, squashed in amidst a small mob of reporters... behind a
	police line.  He HEARS a reporter next to him say:

				REPORTER
		I think he's coming out now.

				TOM
			(to his crew)
		They say he's coming out now.

	A surge.

				TOM
			(to Reporter)
		Is that him?

				TOM'S CAMERAMAN
		Yes.

	Tom checks his notes.


	INSERT - TOM'S BLACK BOOK

	The same model we've seen Jane use.  A list of questions
	written in big color highlighted letters.  As he looks down
	to study them, everyone else moves suddenly off.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions.
	"Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been
	awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the
	movement of the vehicle.

	ON TOM

	Standing alone and forlorn as his crew trots back.

				CAMERAMAN
			(observing Tom)
		What's wrong?

				TOM
		I had a lot of questions here.  I
		missed the story.

				CAMERAMAN
		Don't worry, it's okay.  I got
		a piece of his face.

	EXT. GUERRILLAS CAMP - MORNING

	Jane is standing -- talking to her crew.  Others asleep
	in b.g. -- a drowsy, morning-after feeling.

				JANE
		Are you all packed and ready?

				CAMERAMAN
		The stuff in the dark is not good.
		Nobody wants news lit like that.

				JANE
		Will you just get packed?

	She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding
	a knapsack in her hand.  She takes off a brush and runs it
	through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel
	toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water
	from her canteen.  She puts everything back in place, then looks
	about, sobs for several beats.  One of the Guerrillas hears her
	sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance
	away.  Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of
	explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

	INT. WASHINGTON CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

	The Washington Control Room.  Jennifer, Jane, Aaron, Blair stand
	watching the intro to the Central American piece.  Tom stands in
	the distant b.g.  There are over a dozen monitors -- including
	one which is constantly on the anchor man, Bill Rorish.

	ON TELEVISION MONITORS

	Bill Rorish on camera -- an INSERT behind showing Aaron in
	blackness planted into a Central American map bordered by rifles.
	A separate monitor shows the INSERT alone.

				BILL (voice over)
		A fire fight along the Nicaraguan
		border...in one minute.

	The INSERT MOVES OUT AT US TO FILL THE SCREEN -- WE SEE Aaron's
	dim outline and HEAR him say:

				AARON (voice over; on camera)
		The first shots were fired not thirty
		seconds ago.

	The MUSICAL "EVENING NEWS" SIGNATURE COMES IN ever-so-briefly.
	The SCREEN GOES TO A COMMERCIAL -- as Blair screams
	enthusiastically.

				BLAIR
		Great graphic, great graphic.

	Ernie ENTERS THE  SCENE... He kisses Jane in greeting -- pats
	Aaron on the back.

				ERNIE
		You finally got a piece in a few
		minutes early and I hear Bill loved it.

	Jennifer gives Jane a mock pat on the back.

				ERNIE (continuing)
		I have somebody downstairs who one of
		the clerks brought in and vouches for.
		He says he has something to say about
		gays getting promotions at State...
		It can't hurt to tape him.

	ON JANE

	As she feels Tom staring at her -- turns and notices him
	for the first time.

				TOM
		Hi.

				JANE
		How's it going?

				TOM
		Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?

				JANE
			(thrown)
		I just got back -- I don't know
		which end is up.

				TOM
		Okay.

	In the b.g. WE MAY HAVE NOTICED Bill Rorish on one monitor as he
	picks up the phone at his anchor desk, during the commercial
	break.

				BLAIR
		Jane!  Bill Rorish wants to speak
		to you at the break.
			(as she hands it to her)
		I never heard of him handing over
		compliments in the middle of the
		show.

	There is a stillness in the Control Room as Jane speaks to the
	anchor man in New York who WE CAN VIEW on a monitor.

	ON MONITOR

	We see Bill Rorish.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Jane?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Yes.

				BILL
			(into phone)
		Well, darling, if it gets any better than
		that, I'm going to have to bring you up
		here to New York.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first
		twenty seconds.

	Blair cringes at Jane's blunt reply.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		But thanks.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, the visual with the boots at the
		end was just perfect.

	Jane covers the mouthpiece and turns to Aaron.

				JANE
		God, he loved the boots.

	Aaron reaches happily for the phone.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Aaron should be hearing this so I
		have an extra witness.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		Well, you always want to give the 
		credit away, do you?

				JANE
			(into phone)
		No, I don't.  He happens to deserve
		the credit.  He's right here.

				BILL
			(over phone)
		I'll speak to you soon

	We see Rorish over the monitor.  He hangs up.

				JANE
			(to Aaron)
		He had to read over some new copy.

	We see on the monitor that this is not so.  It's a very eggy moment
	Aaron.  Tom breaks the silence.

				TOM
			(to the rescue)
		Okay if I watch you tape that interview
		downstairs?

				AARON
		Yeah.

	As he passes Jane he leans next to her and WE HEAR him WHISPER.

				AARON
		Please laugh so they think I'm not
		dying inside but have so much style
		I just said something funny.

	Jane does her part enormously well -- laughing with amusement...
	but her eyes blaze -- her friend has been needlessly humiliated.
	Blair wants desperately to be inside Aaron's joke.

				BLAIR
		What did he say?

				JANE
			(as if still amused)
		I'll never tell.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	BUDDY FELTON waits alone.  A CAMERA CREW watches him.  He is
	well dressed, exceedingly nervous.  He summons the courage to
	ask a question.

				BUDDY
		Could I see how I photograph?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Huh?  Sorry?

				BUDDY
		'Cause for the interview they're
		going to use a screen and disguise
		me to protect my anonymity so could
		I see myself before that?

				CAMERAWOMAN
		Sure.

	The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image
	comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor.  He's not
	happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction --
	gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it.  Aaron enters.
	Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily.
	But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush.  Buddy's
	internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up,
	fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his
	thoughts.

	Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

				AARON
		It's Mr. Buddy Felton?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		That's your full name?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		I might as well ask you the questions
		on tape.  Is that all right?

				BUDDY
		Yes.

				AARON
		You worked at one time as 
		Foreign Service Trainee in the
		State Department.

				BUDDY
		I was there two years and was promoted
		on merit nine times.

				AARON
		Eventually rising to...

				BUDDY
		Office Bimbo. 
			(curbing his amusement) 
		No, I'm sorry.

	Aaron is having a hard enough day,  He is visibly annoyed.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're
		gay had something directly to do with
		your promotions?

				AARON
		Eventually rising to?

				BUDDY

		G.S.  I don't know.
			(scratches his head)
		I don't know numbers.

	Tom laughs.  Aaron shoots him a look.

				AARON
		You're saying the fact that you're gay had
		something directly to do with your promotions?

				BUDDY
		I don't like the word gay.

				AARON
		Which would you prefer?

				BUDDY
		Ravenous homosexual.

				AARON
		Stop the tape, okay.  Forget it,
		Ellen.  Let's call security and
		get him out.

	As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy
	walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.

				BUDDY
			(self flagellating)
		Great time to act out, Buddy.  You
		won't be happy until you turn the
		whole world off.

	He notices Tom.

				BUDDY
		They're not really going to call
		security are they?

				TOM
		No, I don't think so.

				BUDDY
		How do I get out of here?

				TOM
		Follow me.

				BUDDY
			(dazzled)
		You talked me into it.

	INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

	Tom distracted -- his day has been a bit of a bummer.  Buddy
	self conscious -- the proximity creating an almost unbearable
	tension of romance and adventure.

	INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

	A Guard on duty -- a BLACK WOMAN.  She sees Buddy.

				GUARD
		Oh, you're the gay guy.  I was just
		coming to find you.

				BUDDY
		I'm leaving.

				TOM
			(to Guard)
		It's okay.

	EXT. STREET - NIGHT

	Walking.  Buddy in step with him.

				BUDDY
		Sir?

	Tom turns.  Buddy talks rather quickly -- He cares very much
	about leaving Tom with the right impression.  The last words
	of his speech he hadn't expected to say.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		Thank you for not shunning me and
		all.
			(more)
		I really did have all that information
		but I thought I might just be being
		vindictive to get a little hunk of
		the ol' spotlight.  I know, horrible --
		but I didn't do it, so okay?  And
		thanks again and would you like to
		have a drink -- at a regular bar?

				TOM
		Oh, sure.  Okay.

	His heart racing, Buddy attempts casual matter-of-factness.

				BUDDY
		Is there a regular bar around here?

	INT./ENT. REGULAR BAR - NIGHT

	Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools.  For Tom, the last weeks have
	been humbling, antagonistic.  He's enjoying Buddy who listens
	attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.

				TOM
		I've been doing some morning show
		stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't
		bother me.  I'm in no rush for
		anything.  It's just the snotty
		attitude, even if I have it coming,
		it's still...

				BUDDY
		Bad manners.

				TOM
		Yes.  That's right.

				BUDDY
		I know...I mean you didn't do anything
		special for me tonight.  You just had
		what I think are good manners, decency.
		And it really makes me want to be nice
		back and it has nothing to do with any
		homosexual thing.
			(looks right at him)
		Honestly.
			(then away)
		Because I don't know if you've
		homosexual or not and -- you're not,
		are you?

				TOM
		No...no.

				BUDDY
		One's enough.

	Tom signals for the check.

				BUDDY (cont'd)
		I wasn't doing anything.

				TOM
		I really have to go.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  At least let me show my
		appreciation.  The Secretary of Labor
		is going to be indicted on Wednesday.
		For the graft thing he supposedly did
		before he was appointed.

				TOM
		What?

				BUDDY
		Yes, it's true.  They're going to
		make it public Wednesday but isn't
		it a big deal for you to have it a
		day and a half early?

				TOM
		Yes.  How do you know?

				BUDDY
			(shrugs)
		My roommate's very social -- somebody
		from Justice was over and...I always
		hear things before they happen.  Hey,
		and from now on, so do you.

	INT. ERNIE'S OFFICE - DAY

	George Weln, the black correspondent and Tom are seated in the
	office with Ernie -- they are in mid-meeting.

				GEORGE
		I'm virtually certain it's not true.
		He may be indicted eventually, but I
		don't think it will be this month.

				ERNIE
			(to Tom)
		You want to be alone with me --
		tell me your source?

				TOM
		If I told you I'm not sure it would 
		totally convince you, but I totally 
		believe the guy.

				GEORGE
			(insufferable)
		Labor is my Department -- I can't
		conform it and my contacts go very
		deep.

				TOM
		So if it's true -- I'm terrific,
		right?

				ERNIE
		It's not even a close call.  Of
		course we can't go with it.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - FOLLOWING DAY

	Jane is working with Bobbie the editor... Snatches of the tape
	make it obvious that the Labor Secretary has been indicted --
	George Weln stands behind Jane, who is dialing a number.

				BOBBIE
		Do you want him all the way to the 
		car?

				JANE
		No stop where he's all besieged.

				BOBBIE
		Because...

				JANE
			(to Bobbie)
		Right there, Bobbie.

	Tom enters.

				TOM
		So he was indicted?

				JANE
		Yes.

				GEORGE
		We were right not to go with it.

				TOM
		But I was right -- just somebody give
		it to me.  I had a good story.

				JANE
			(to George)
		Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.

				TOM
		Ah, I don't want any credit.  Bobbie
		and I serve anonymously.

	He pats Bobbie on the back... and exits.

				BOBBIE
			(pausing in his work)
		You know, I like Tom, because hi...

				JANE
		Bobbie, please.

	INT. METRO BUS - DAY

	Crowded rush hour... Buddy and Tom stand next to each other.

				BUDDY
		...and the White House is hoping to
		keep a lid on it for a few days till
		they figure out what to do.

				TOM
		Thanks a lot, Buddy.

				BUDDY
			(brushing it off)
		Oh, please.  So they were really
		impressed with you at work.

				TOM
		Not impressed exactly -- but a break
		in the clouds.

				BUDDY
		I see the change in you -- I see it.

	INT. WHITE HOUSE PRESS ROOM - DAY

	The 10 A.M. briefing just breaking up -- Jennifer leaves her
	network seat in the front row, only to be grabbed by Tom who
	steers her outside.

	EXT. WHITE HOUSE EAST WING - DAY

	In the near distance a circular driveway and a silent armed
	MARINE GUARD, standing at attention.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		So he bought this Peugeot sedan at
		a greatly reduced price while he was
		there in charge of the White House
		Advance Team.

				JENNIFER
		How come you're not chasing it down
		yourself?

				TOM
		Look, I'm junior man -- and it's
		your beat.

				JENNIFER
		Boy, that's nice...I wish we could
		all deal with each other like this.
		I'll check it.  Anything I can do
		for you?

				TOM
		This is my first time at the White House.
		Is there any chance to look at where
		he works and the rest of it?

				JENNIFER
		I didn't have the guts to ask when
		I first came up.  I'll get you a
		great tour.

	INT. BAR - EARLY EVENING

	Buddy and Tom watching the Evening News as Jennifer finishes
	her story.

				JENNIFER
			(voice over; on TV set)
		The President says it's not a violation
		but nonetheless White House sources
		say the full price will be paid for the
		Peugeot and new rules will put future
		bargain hunting off limits for
		Presidential Aides.  This is Jennifer Mack
		at the White House.

	Tom and Buddy smile at each other... energized -- up.

				BUDDY
		Forgive me, but it really is intoxicating
		being a news source.

				TOM
		Nobody else had it.

				BUDDY
		I wish it were you giving the story.

				TOM
		That's okay.

				BUDDY
		What if we just don't tell them
		anything anymore unless they let
		you do the story?

				TOM
		No.  Really...don't worry about it.

				BUDDY
		Okay.  And look, in the future I can
		call you when I have news for you.
		Don't feel you have to spend time
		with me just to get the information.
			(a breath; then
			 to himself)
		Well, that wasn't as hard to say as
		you thought, was it, Buddy?

				TOM
		What do you mean?  You're one of the
		few people in this town I can talk
		to.

	Buddy puts his hand to his heart and makes a LOUD SOUND OF
	RAPTURE.

				BUDDY
		Hoooo.

	The BARTENDER and some nearby patrons turn and look.  Tom shifts
	with discomfort.

				TOM
		Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.

				BUDDY
			(simply)
		Okay.

	INT. WASHINGTON BUREAU - NIGHT

	Jane waiting for an elevator... It comes and she steps on just
	as Tom clearly excited comes around the bend from Ernie's office
	calling for her.  He goes to the stairs.

	INT. WALKWAY - NIGHT

	He runs out and sees Jane in the lobby below, then takes off
	after her.

	INT. LOBBY - NIGHT

	As he enters and runs outside, looking in both directions then
	running off to the right.  A BEAT -- REVEALING Jane has stopped
	to talk with Blair -- now she exits.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom on the street, ahead of her, thinking he's behind her...
	He runs another half a block and stops dejected... Turns to walk
	back to the office.  He keeps looking back to see if he missed
	her, so that his head is turned as Jane reaches him, says a
	fairly social:

				JANE
		Hi, how are you?

	She keeps moving -- Tom spinning after her.

				TOM
		Wait -- I need you.

	She stops.

				TOM
		I've got another story.

				JANE
		Some public official skipped a week
		on his Christmas Club?

				TOM
		The House Armed Service Committee
		has a secret report which says that
		the General Stillwell tank the Army
		has dumped a fortune into plain 
		won't work.  I have it cold,
		confirmed.  They have five million
		dollars in this thing already.

				JANE
		Billion.

				TOM
		Okay, billion...right, of course.
		They told me I could have any producer
		I wanted -- and I want you.

	As Tom savors the moment.

	INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING

	Various bureau personnel standing at their desks watching Tom's
	piece being broadcast.  We SEE a TANK MISFIRING.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		One source referred to it as a
		five billion dollar metal sculpture
		to ugly to look at and too big to bury.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		You write this?

				JANE
		I write for you sometimes.

				AARON
		Not because you have to.

	ON MONITOR

	We SEE a General walking away from Tom.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		General Elton McGuire is in charge of
		the weapon system.

	ON MONITOR - TWO SHOT

				GENERAL
		I've been in the Army twenty-seven
		years -- so I'll let the Army ask
		the questions, not you.

				TOM
		General, I don't want to bother you
		anymore or your family.  But tomorrow
		there will be a mob of me back here --
		so, if you have anything to say, why
		not say it now, sir, the way you want?

	ON TOM

	He is a study.

	Looking at himself -- and though it's far from his first time on
	television -- it's the first time he's seen himself doing serious
	work and, by all appearances, doing it well.  As the General
	answers in the b.g. --

				BLAIR
		I think it's great of us to have left
		in what you said -- just great of us.

	Tom smiles modestly.

				AARON
		Yeah, let's never forget.  We're
		the real story.  Not them.

	Tom and Jane look over -- then Tom looks to Jane for a verdict.
	In the b.g., the news goes to a commercial.

				JANE
		Yeah, I know, I went back and forth
		on it.

				BLAIR
		I liked it.  He's not afraid to be
		human.

	Ernie ENTERS THE SCENE with his fourteen-year-old DAUGHTER
	in tow... He approaches Tom.

				ERNIE
		My youngest wanted to meet you.
		This is Ellie.

				TOM
		Hi, Ellie.

				ERNIE
		You should be honored -- she
		never cares about meeting
		anyone here.  But she liked you
		on television just now.

				AARON
			(entering scene)
		Hi, Ellie -- remember me?

				ELLIE
		I'm sorry -- from where?

				AARON
		I've been to your house a lot...

				ERNIE
			(helping)
		And Aaron went on that fourteen
		day raft trip with us last year.

				ELLIE
			(vaguely)
		Oh yes -- hi.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT (LATE)

	Tom is on the phone.

				TOM
			(into phone)
		Hi, Dad...Did you see it?  Great --
		I'll send you a tape...I'm sorry I
		haven't called.  Things were a little
		bumpy for a while.  It's not important...
		I'm fine now.
			(what he's been
			 wanting to say aloud)
		Hey, Dad -- I just may be able to
		do this job...Well, I'm glad you
		were sure.

	INT. ERNIE MARRIMAN'S VIRGINIA HOME - DAY

	Ernie is hosting the news staff for Sunday brunch -- they stand
	around drinking in small groups... Aaron is standing with Blair
	and a MAN in his fifties we have not seen before.

				BLAIR
		I don't know why we have to feel
		defensive about it.  Newspapers
		are in business to make money --
		why not us?

	Aaron looks at her in amazement.

				BLAIR
		They criticize us for supposedly
		pandering while they run WINGO
		Games.

				GREY HAIRED MAN
			(amused)
		Exactly right.  Excuse me.  I'm
		paid to mix.

	Blair and Aaron laugh appreciatively as he walks off to another
	group.

				BLAIR
		Goodbye, Paul.

				AARON
		Take care, Paul.
			(back to Blair)
		It takes a certain kind of courage
		for you to say that in front of
		the President of the News Division.

				BLAIR
		You think anyone who's proud of
		the work we do is an ass kisser.

				AARON
		No.  I think anyone who puckers their
		lips and presses it against his boss'
		buttocks and then smooches is an ass
		kisser.

				BLAIR
		My gosh, and for a while there, I was
		attracted to you.

	She walks off.

				AARON
		Wait a minute -- that changes
		everything.

	ON JANE

	At the bar getting a drink.

	Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until
	they are standing alone.

				JENNIFER
		This is very awkward.

				JANE
		Go ahead -- what?

				JENNIFER
		Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but
		I see Tom around you a lot and this
		is such a small office and I'd like
		to see him outside of work, unless
		there's some reason for you to mind...
		in which case I just won't do anything.

				JANE
		God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind?
		Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What
		a shock -- I don't have a right to...
		I don't think I like him.  I know
		I don't respect him...So what am
		I talking about -- what am I saying
		to you?

				JENNIFER
		You're saying stay away from him.

				JANE
			(stupefied)
		I can't be.

	She blinks in wonder.

				JENNIFER
		We don't have to settle this
		definitively right now.

	Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied
	by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle
	and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she
	moves off -- not wanting to deal with him.  She takes a few
	breaths as she keeps walking.  We HEAR snatches of PARTY
	CONVERSATIONS, i.e:

				GEORGE WELN
		Tell me one person who ever left
		television news to work on a
		newspaper.

	She moves on; Tom still following.

				ERNIE'S WIFE
			(holding Paul's arm)
		I felt so proud when he turned
		down News Vice President so we
		could stay here.  Suddenly, after
		all these years, we have a life.

	Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few
	feet away.

				JANE
			(badly)
		Hi, Tom.

	She stands there, genuinely frightened.  She must deal with him
	now.  He crosses to her.

				TOM
		It's the firs time I've seen 
		you dressed like this.  You look
		so clean and pretty.

				JANE
		What do you mean clean?

				TOM
		At work there's always this
		sort of film over you.

				JANE
		Well, thumps like me leave appearance
		to guys like you.

				TOM
		You're great at taking the edge
		off a good time.

	Jane starts twitching.  She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on
	his arm to steady herself.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Yes.  Just don't say anything mean
		for a while.  Thanks.

	She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses
	control for the first time in her memory.  She looks strange as
	she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.

				JANE
		I've got to find someone.  It's
		important.  Excuse me.

	She walks away.

	ON AARON AND ERNIE

				ERNIE
		I had the strangest thing happen
		yesterday.  Anne and I have been
		married what? -- Thirty-six years...
		Everything fine -- two days after the
		promotion came through, I was checking
		myself in the mirror and she was
		making a face at me behind my back.
		So yesterday I looked in the mirror
		and she was doing it again.

				AARON
		You didn't say anything to her?

	He shakes his head.

				ERNIE
		My instincts tell me not to.

	Annie comes up.

				ANNE
		The office is phoning, honey.

	He EXITS SCENE as Anne watches him go.

				ANNE
		I hope he moves that fast when
		it's me on the line.

	ON JANE

	As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she
	picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled.  She
	sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a
	too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.

				JANE
		Jennifer.  Hey, Jennifer.

	ON STAIRCASE

	Jennifer turning as Jane whips up the stairs.

				JANE
		Forget what I said -- you do
		whatever you want to with him.

	She pushes at Jennifer a little.

				JENNIFER
		Well, there's nothing I'm going
		to do right this second.

	Jane pushes her again.

				JENNIFER
		But it's a party, right?

	Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back
	down the steps and crosses to Tom.

	FULL SCENE

	Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then
	Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters
	and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent...
	The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer.  We PICK UP just
	a few words:

				ERNIE
		This would be a good time to tap
		that source of yours.  He could
		have an angle or something.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed
	looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie
	now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new
	energy in the area.  Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet
	them.

				ERNIE
			(to Jane)
		We want you to exec produce a
		Special Report...

				JANE
		What?

	Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

				ERNIE
		A Libyan plane shot up one of our
		bases in Egypt.  It's all still
		happening.

				JANE
		Let's figure out the field.

				ERNIE
		Unfortunately, since Paul's here,
		he's made out the assignments...
		Jennifer at the White House...
		George at the Pentagon...Martin
		at State...and we need an anchor
		since Rorish is in his boat, so we're
		gonna do the whole report this
		afternoon from here...with Tom.

				AARON
		That's it.  I resign as of now.

				ERNIE
			(to Aaron)
		Stop it.

				AARON
		I'll tell you what.  I'll stay if
		Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.

				JANE
		Ernie, as much as I like you, I
		think I have to tell Paul what I
		think, because this is really sort
		of obscenely stupid.

				ERNIE
		Jane, if you want to, go ahead.  I
		don't disagree with you.

	Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the
	big boss.

	ON JANE

	As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually
	catching up with Paul.  In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the
	"BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.

				TOM
		Hello, Buddy.  It's 1:35 -- and
		this is Tom.  You can reach me
		at the office.  It's important.
		I can use a little help.

	Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered
	intensity.

				JANE
		Tom isn't ready for the job
		you're about to hand him.  Not
		near ready.  Not by the longest
		shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks
		in Tripoli, he's interviewed
		Gaddafi -- he reported on the
		Eight-one story.  I think he's
		essential to do the job we're
		capable of and I think it's my
		responsibility to tell you that.

				PAUL
		Okay, that's your opinion.  I
		don't agree.

				JANE
		It's not opinion.

				PAUL
		You're just absolutely right
		and I'm absolutely wrong?

	She nods.

				PAUL
		It must be nice to always believe
		you know better.  To think you're
		always the smartest person in the
		room.

				JANE
			(from her depths)
		No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.

				JANE
			(turning to leave)
		We'd better get moving.

	As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her
	towards the door.

				AARON
		What happened?

				JANE
		I'll tell you later -- where
		you going to watch from?

				AARON
		Watch? --

				JANE
		I'll come by your place, right
		after...drink, take pills...
		Love you.

	She runs out the door.  Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's
	last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.

				AARON
		Yeah, love you, too.

	EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

	As Jane briefly pauses to see which war has room.  Tom opens
	the passenger seat of his car -- she gets in.  It moves off.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - DAY

	As it moves off.

				JANE
		Nervous?

				TOM
		Excited.

	Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told
	the truth.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with
	activity.  Tom closes the door.  He sits down behind his desk
	and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there.
	He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside.  He picks
	one.  He reaches for a package of new red suspenders.  He takes
	off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work
	of an expert craftsman.  By the time he finishes he looks like
	the authority figure we know he's now.

	INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR

	Jane is NOT hyper.  She is purposeful -- organized -- even
	calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on
	the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.

				JANE
		Tell George and Jessica to try
		and cover everything without
		Tom having to ask additional
		questions.

				BLAIR
		And Bobbie says...

				JANE
		Did you hear what I just said --
		do you have that?  Take a breath.

				BLAIR
			(a breath, then)
		Yes.

	In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about --
	waiting for some indication as to what to do next.

				JANE
		And the most important thing
		make sure his earpiece works,
		have back-ups ready.  That's
		never been more vital.  He
		must be able to hear me at
		every second and clearly.

	Jane sees him.  She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the
	arm.

				JANE
		We have twenty minutes -- you can
		wait in the studio.

	Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a
	nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.

	GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY

	Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic
	representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force
	Mirage Fighter.

				JANE
		Put in the radar plane that spotted
		them to begin with.

				GRAPHIC ARTIST
		We have no pictures on file.

				JANE
		I can't draw -- but this is a
		rough idea.

	She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline
	an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane.  Her work is
	stunning.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a
	bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play.  He picks
	a French song -- looks at some of his books.  He might even
	read.  He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one.
	He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.

	INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY

	Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio --
	there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up.  Buddy
	is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	ON BUDDY AND SECURITY GUARD

				GUARD
		I have to check first.

				BUDDY
			(a bit frantic)
		Well, then check -- but hurry --
		There he is!!!

	Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's
	gestures to slow down.

				BUDDY
		Is everything all right?

				TOM
		Yes.  You didn't have to come here.
		It's just that I'm going to anchor
		this special report on this Libyan
		thing...

				BUDDY
			(delighted)
		Anchor?

				TOM
			(amused despite
			 situation)
		Yes, stop!  I wondered if you could
		find out anything about what's
		happening.
			(on Buddy's reaction)
		What's wrong?

				BUDDY
		I broke up with my roommate --
		He was really the magnet for
		everyone who knew anything.

				TOM
		Oh.

				BUDDY
		Look, I can start up with him again
		if you really...

				TOM
		No.  I'm doing fine...Look.

	Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

				BUDDY
		Good.  He's on the world's longest
		ego trip, let him take it alone.

				TOM
		Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've 
		got to go to work.

				BUDDY
			(to Tom)
		...good-bye then.

				TOM
		I'll speak to you.

				BUDDY
		Well, who knows.  Just let m tell
		you what my favorite teacher ever,
		told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be
		wonderful.'

	He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on
	the cheek.  Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet
	his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past
	the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the
	two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the
	wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and
	table occupied by Blair.  Now she slips into the large well
	paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.

	Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide
	immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State
	and the White House.  In front of her the bank of monitors, the
	Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at
	Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.

	ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR

	As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus
	of minds and machines comprising the big time network news.
	And Jane Craig is at the helm.  Blair experiences a flash of 
	emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.

				BLAIR
			(sotto to Jane)
		Executive Producer -- wow.

	Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does
	a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a
	graphic reading:  SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
	say, "This is a Special Report from..."

	INSERT:  JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

	Each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect
	her to Tom and the Field Reporters.  She presses the button
	marked "Tom."

				JANE
		You hear me, Tom?  Tom?  Tom?
		Damn it...He can't hear me...
			(to Blair)
		I told you if there was one thing...

	Tom's VOICE on speakers.

				TOM
			(voice over; relaxed)
		I can hear you.  I was just teasing.

	Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by
	the macho cool as:

	Tom smiles towards her then -- poises himself just as the
	Announcer's last words clear.

				ANNOUNCER'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		...in Washington, Tom Grunick.

	He begins his report.  He seems authoritative, compelling, even
	in a low key way.  We trust him.

				TOM
		Good afternoon.  A Libyan fighter
		plane attacked a United States
		Military Installation early this
		morning and was, itself, shot down
		by American F-14 Interceptors.

	Another monitor shows the Graphic running.  In the b.g. two
	men approaches Paul.  They look out of place, decidedly
	non-business like.

				MAN ONE
		Mr. Moore, I'm Marvin Usher and this 
		is my brother, Stuart.

				PAUL
		Not now!!!
			(gesturing)
		Look.

				TOM
		The Libyan Missile destroyed an Army
		Warehouse which, just thirty minutes
		earlier, had been crowded with 
		servicemen.  No one was injured.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading
	a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him.  He
	SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point
	providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

				AARON
			(SINGING LOUDLY)
		And I can read while I sing.

	He picks up the television remote-control device an puts the
	television on, the SOUND OFF.

	ON TV

	We SEE the graphic of the Libyan plane's flight route, its
	missile firing -- the U.S. planes taking off and the shooting
	down of the Mirage jet... At one point Aaron lowering the MUSIC
	and raising the TV SOUND hearing Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
			(voice over)
		The heat seeking missile virtually
		disintegrated the  plane on...

	Aaron turns down the TV SOUND and turns up the MUSIC.

	INT. BOOTH

	Jane's hand flicks at the button marked "PENTAGON."

				JANE
		George, you're ready.

	ON PENTAGON MONITOR

	We SEE George and HEAR him through Jane's voice box.

				GEORGE
			(voice over)
		Should I cover everything or should
		I save something for Tom to ask about?

				JANE
		Cover everything!

	George nods.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		We're going to George.  Say 'the
		Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have
		George Weln at the Pentagon'.

	ON TOM

				TOM
		George Weln is at the Pentagon where
		the attack launched by the lone
		Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive
		movement of military might.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY

	Where he still balances STEREO and TV SOUND.

				AARON
		A lot of alliteration from anxious
		anchors placed in powerful posts.

	He picks up the phone.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	As Blair hands it to Jane.

				BLAIR
		It's Aaron.

				JANE
		Yes?

				AARON
		I think the pilot that shot down the
		Libyan in 1981 is stationed right
		here.  Maybe you could get him --
		and maybe Tom should say that our F-14
		is one of the hardest planes to fly.
		They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.

				JANE
		Thanks.
			(to Tom)
		The F-14 is one of the most difficult
		planes to master.
			(remembering)
		Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in
		the 70's the first crop had a number
		of crashes.

				TOM
		George, isn't the F-14 Tomcat one of 
		the most difficult machines for a
		pilot to master?

				GEORGE
		I think you're right -- it's certainly
		one of our hottest planes.

	INT. AARON'S ROOM - DAY

				AARON
		I say it here -- it comes out there.

	He giggles.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		There was trouble with them in the
		early days -- back in the 70's.

	Aaron dials again... As we SEE Jennifer standing at the
	White House.

				AARON
			(into phone)
		Me again.  Hi.  Listen Gaddafi doesn't
		foam at the mouth or anything.  When
		you speak to him he's not at all nuts.
		He seems like a leader -- very
		impressive, self-control...that's
		what's so strange.

	ON JANE

				JANE
		Right and we have the '81
		pilot on the way in -- Nobody else
		will have him.

				AARON
			(voice over)
		You're welcome.  Sow how does it
		feel to...I know you gotta go --
		Me too.  We're very busy here.

	He hangs up -- LONG SHOT... Aaron with his remote controls.
	The picture switches back to Tom.  He turns UP the VOLUME.

				TOM
			(voice over)
		...outlaw nation but strangely those
		who have interviewed Gaddafi find
		him, in a phrase we like to use in
		this country, very 'presidential'.

				AARON
		Nice, Jane.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

	Jane is on the phone.  The atmosphere buckling with strain.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Just a minute.

	Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		To State for the message from Libya,
		then you'll have the carrier pilot
		from the Sidra in time to...
			(a sudden shriek)
		What?  No!

	ON TOM

	Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

	BACK TO JANE

	As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she
	is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.

				JANE
		We only have ten minutes left --
		how can you talk to me about parking
		problems?  No, not you'll try...you'll
		do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat
		ass, Estelle.  Good-bye.

	As she BANGS the PHONE down.  Paul comments sotto to Ernie.

				PAUL
			(sotto)
		I had no idea she was this good.

				JANE
			(hitting Tom's button)
		Fill for a second.

				TOM
			(fluidly)
		The latest message seems to indicate
		that the Libyan pilot was acting on
		his own without authority from anyone
		else.
			(into camera directly)
		In other words, I think we're okay.

	INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER

	MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE,
	TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages,
	even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees
	the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a
	assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him,
	beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN
	TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN
	TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells
	him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.

				TOM
		...So, Commander, it must have been
		a bit tougher today -- shooting down
		the French-made Mirage Jet.  The one
		you got was a SU-22...etc...

	And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece
	and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract
	vision.

	INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY

				TOM'S VOICE
		...Once again:  The Libyan Government
		has disavowed any prior knowledge of
		the flight.  This has been Tom Grunick
		reporting from Washington.

	The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and
	Blair momentarily grasp hands.  The first talk concerns Tom.

				PAUL
		He was brilliant.  I've never been
		as proud of one of my decisions.

				ERNIE
			(calls back to Jane)
		Great work, Jane, really -- You know?
		Really.

	She nods... totally depleted.

				JANE
		Well, there were no major gaffs anyway.

	Ernie scoffs in her direction.

				JANE
		Thanks, everybody.

	She exits the scene.

				PAUL
			(to the Usher brothers)
		This was important for Tom -- there's
		that bonding thing that happens with
		the public and an anchorman during a
		crisis.  It's not the conventions
		anymore; it's this kind of moment.

	Tom enters.  He is exuberant.

				PAUL
			(to Tom)
		What a baptismal.  Congratulations.

				TOM
		Thanks.  With all the help you get,
		it's sure easier than local.

	Paul and Ernie exchange a glance.

				TOM (cont'd)
		Where's Jane?  I'm still juiced.

	Ernie points off... as Tom exits.  The Usher brothers hover.

				ERNIE
			(to the Usher brothers)
		Can I help you?

				MARVIN
		We're here to play the new news theme.

				ERNIE
		New theme?  You don't need me for this.

				PAUL
		Stay.  Why should I be the only one
		to feel silly?

				MAN ONE
		We need a synthesizer -- but this
		will give you an idea.

				PAUL
		Go ahead.
			(to Ernie)
		Wasn't he great?

				ERNIE
		It worked.

	Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective
	news theme:  a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering
	composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact
	that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	As Tom makes his way across it -- crews are drifting in... He
	enters Jane's cubby, flushed with the electricity of the "win"
	the most noteworthy moment of his working life.

	INT. JANE'S CUBBY - DAY

				TOM
		You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling
		having you inside my head.

				JANE
			(a bit thrown)
		Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.

				TOM
		Indescribable -- you knew just when to 
		feed me the next thing, just a split 
		second before I needed it.  There was a 
		rhythm we got into, like great sex.

	Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of
	truthfulness.

				TOM
		You have to celebrate with me, don't
		you?  Everybody's going to that bar
		on the corner, 'Caps.'

				JANE
		I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll
		hoop up with all of you later.  How
		long do you think you'll be there?

	Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer.  They
	enters the elevator.

	EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT

	As several people cross the street towards the bar.  Tom has
	been holding back on one question.

				TOM
		It's tempting to ask you how you think
		I did.
			(she starts to reply)
		No.  I'm enjoying myself.  Take it easy.

	He starts across the street.

				JANE
			(trying to be casual)
		Maybe I'll see you over there.

	Indicates Bar.

				TOM
		You'll never show up.

	He starts across the street -- then turns and calls to her.

				TOM
		Jane?

				JANE
		Yeah?

				TOM
		I'll wait for you till seven.

				JANE
			(shouting back)
		Okay.

	Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g.
	pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction.  Jane
	moving quickly along.

	SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues
	through:

	EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

	As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the
	stoop outside.

	ON AARON

	Happy to see her, rising fairly soberly to his feet.  He APPLAUDS
	as she comes toward him.

				JANE
		Really?  It was good.

	He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

				JANE
		Your calling in that information --
		you're the classiest guy I know.

	He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.

				AARON
		It was strange to watch him.  What's
		the next step?  Lip synching?

	She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.

				AARON
		I've been doing some of the most
		important thinking of my life.  I
		wonder if this is the right time to
		tell you about it.

	She steals a glance at her watch.

				JANE
		Well, whatever you think.

				AARON
		I figured out exactly why it is I'm so
		hung up on getting a chance at weekend
		anchor...It's because if I do that well,
		they'll pay me more, treat me great and
		my life will be better.  That's why.

				JANE
		Sounds like you may be on to something.

				AARON
		Which means I'm at their mercy and who
		wants that?...I'm not going to tell
		you where this thought led me...
		Anyway, well, why not  tell you? --
		it's a happy thing.  In the middle of
		all this I start to think about something
		that does nothing but make me feel good
		and makes immediate sense and that's you
		...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give
		anything if you were two people so I could
		call up the one who's my friend and tell
		her about the one I'm in I...I don't think
		I should go any further.  Come on --
		I'll walk you to the corner.

	He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.

				JANE
		You know you've had a strange day...
		I'd sleep on all these things you've
		been thinking.

				AARON
		Absolutely...You go have a good time...
		You have some place to go?

				JANE
		Yes.

				AARON
		Good.

	He grabs her and hugs her exuberantly -- takes her face in his
	hands and kisses her full on the lips.

				AARON
		Well, I felt something.

	He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	ON JANE

	As the SOUND OF NEWS THEME VOCALIZING PICKS UP ONE MORE...
	Jane moving quickly, hailing a cab.

	INT. CAB - EVENING

				JANE
		We're going to Caps Bar at
		Seventeenth and Vermont;
		Connecticut is clear on Sunday...
		take that over to Fifteenth, then
		around Vermont and we'll bypass
		the circle that way...if you don't
		go over forty we should catch mostly
		green lights.

	ON the DRIVER'S annoyed look.

				JANE
		Come on -- don't take it the
		wrong way.  I just know about
		things.

	He hits the meter.

	EXT. CAPS BAR - EVENING

	As the cab pulls up, Jane gets out and pays him.

				DRIVER
		Great route.  I never made
		anywhere near that fast before.

				JANE
		Thanks -- good driving --

				DRIVER
		Thanks.  Coming from you I
		appreciate it.

				JANE
		Thanks.

	As she turns to enter the restaurant -- Tom and Jennifer exit.
	As they confront each other:

				TOM
		I didn't think you'd make it.

				JANE
		Well, I thought I'd check if all
		of you were still here.  I'll just
		go in and join the gang and you
		two go on.

				TOM
		There's no gang in there -- We
		were the last ones.

				JANE
		Well, I'll go in and have a bite.

				TOM
			(to Jennifer)
		Jennifer, you want to have another
		drink?

				JANE
		Hey, I know how to have a burger by
		myself.  I feel like a little solitude.

				JENNIFER
			(as they move off)
		I sure know that feeling.  Terrific
		work today.

				JANE
			(too jock-like)
		Right back to you.

				TOM
		Thanks for getting me through.

	He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of
	camaraderie.  She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps
	inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between
	the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection
	over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a
	look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	As Tom and Jennifer rush in locked in an embrace, shedding
	clothes even as they enter.

	INT. JENNIFER'S APT - NIGHT

	We are aware of MOVING FORMS.

				JENNIFER
			(intense shout)
		Damn all you sons-of-bitches.  Oh
		shit, you bastards...

	They finish.  A beat, then:

				JENNIFER
		Sorry.

	ON TOM AND JENNIFER

	Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made
	love to.

				TOM
		No, it's okay...People say different
		things.  They do...the plural threw
		me.

	She laughs.

				JENNIFER
		The last time I was with someone we
		went through this awful mutual disease
		questionnaire but I guess it beats
		getting paranoid the next day.  Okay,
		I'll go first.  I haven't...

				TOM
			(stopping her)
		It would never occur to me to worry
		at all about you.

	Jennifer is touched...

				JENNIFER
		You know something?  I'm deeply
		complimented.   Isn't it strange to
		be deeply complimented because the
		man you're with doesn't think you
		have a venereal disease?...

	Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed
	one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty
	sort of motion punctuated by her comment:

				JENNIFER
		Give me some of that.

	He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid
	grin on his face.

				TOM
		Where's the bathroom?

				JENNIFER
		Through the closet.

	He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

	INT. CLOSET - NIGHT

	It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and
	shoes extraordinarily well organized.  Tom stands there agape.
	Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of
	luggage.

	She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of
	her.

				JENNIFER
		I converted a bedroom -- this
		stuff builds up.  Wait till
		you've been doing this sixteen
		years.

				TOM
		I'm not knocking it.  It's a
		great solution.  Not only the
		storage but you can see everything
		you have.

	Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in
	silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.

				JENNIFER
		Do you do bunny rabbits?

	Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

				TOM
		Isn't this a great date?

	We HEAR the SOUND OF SCRATCHING as we:

	INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING

	Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone
	and SCRATCHING her arm.  She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF
	STATESMEN move across the small screen.  She sighs and, without
	realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet
	to recognize in herself.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		God help me.

	People have begun to filter into the newsroom in the b.g.

				AARON
		Jesus, Jane.  How long have you
		been here?

				JANE
		A long time.  I was restless.
		Will you crack my neck?

	He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings.  she lets it
	ring for a beat as Aaron works on her.  As she picks up the
	receiver we HEAR a CRACK.  She reacts to it at the same time
	she utters a greeting.

				JANE
		Aaah --
			(into phone)
		-- ello.  You sure they said the
		management meeting?
			(hangs up; then
			 to Aaron)
		They want me to be at the
		management meeting.

				AARON
		They're not that dumb, after all.

	He pats her on the back.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

				BLAIR
		Do you know you're the second woman
		in network news history to produce?

				JANE
			(though distracted)
		No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth.
		Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks
		got that credit once on a U.N.
		special and there's Susan Zirinsky.

	INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY

	Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk.
	TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance.  As Paul
	discusses the more pressing problems of the network news
	division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by
	her first moment at the seat of power.  She has the blues.

				PAUL
		Anyway, they seem to be very serious
		about making me out eight million from
		the budget and that means massive firings.
		I'm doing everything I can... It's too
		early to make up a 'death list' but I
		just wanted you to be aware of the
		situation... We're also going to cover
		the Alaskan serial killer trial on a
		continuing basis.  I'd like it done out
		of Washington which means we've got to
		get somebody on a plane for Anchorage.
		We can't fool around anymore...Jane...

	She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.

				PAUL (cont'd)
		This is going to be high-profile on
		the Evening News -- who do you think?
		George Weln or Jennifer?

				JANE
			(much, much too quickly)
		Jennifer.

	The men look at her curiously.  She repeats herself more
	rationally.

				JANE (cont'd)
		Jennifer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON

	He has been reading from a respectable stack of mail -- Jane
	appears in his doorway.  For the first time, we notice that
	she is woefully ba at at least one endeavor -- flirting.

				JANE
		Come on, I'll buy you a drink.
		There's a big thing over at the
		Italian embassy.

				TOM
		I'm not sure I'd be good
		company tonight.

				JANE
			(self-conscious joke)
		I'll be the judge of that.

	INT. ITALIAN EMBASSY - NIGHT

	As they walk in -- one MAN looks at Tom with a glint of
	recognition.  Then another -- a handshake -- A WOMAN introduces
	herself.  A small knot of people form.

				JANE
		It's much too soon for you to have
		this kind of buzz around you.

				TOM
		Do I have to stand here in the middle
		and meet them all?

				JANE
		I'll get you through.  Move and smile.
			(she pushes him
			 a little)
		And smile and move...

	They start crossing the room -- he is moving now, making progress.
	But an EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN stops him.

				EGYPTIAN BUSINESSMAN
		Is it safe for me to fly home?

				TOM
		Yes.  We're fine now.

				JANE
		AND SMILE.

	He smiles -- people smile back.

				JANE
		AND MOVE.

	ANGLE ON STAIR LANDING

	Where Aaron (Pimm's Cut in hand -- a cucumber sticking out)
	stands with Martin Klein.  Martin is eating from a huge platter
	of appetizers.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		The Italians serve the second best
		things right after the Chinese...I
		could do an article comparing Embassy
		food...Gourmet free-loading...sell it
		anyplace.  I'm sure not getting the
		assignments.

				AARON
		Who the heck could that be?

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	From the excited group of people blocking his view,
	it's clear there is some personage in attendance.

	ON AARON

	And now he sees that it's Tom.

				AARON
		Is God testing me or something?

				MARTIN KLEIN
		Paul loves him.  I heard him give
		him the most poetic compliment in
		his command.  'He's hot.'  Sometimes
		groups of executives get together just
		to say that work back and forth...'He's
		hot, oh, she's hot.  Oh, he's really
		hot.'  Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...
			(looking at Aaron)
		And here we are.

				AARON
		Martin, you're not allowed to use the
		word 'we' or I'm moving.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(sudden thought)
		Maybe Jane would like my food idea as
		a spot...Try the one in the middle.

	He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is
	stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.

				TOM
		Hi, Aaron...What's doing?

				AARON
		Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man
		who won three Overseas Press Awards
		pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.

	A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:

				TOM
		You want to go out there --
			(indicating balcony)
		get out of this for a second?

				AARON
		Why don't you lead?  I'll just
		follow the flurry you cause.

	Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.

				TOM
		What did I do to you?

				AARON
		You've made my dreams silly.

	Tom decides not to deal with the remark.  He's jolted by the
	hostility.  He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor
	terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men
	stare at the party.

				TOM
			(gesturing at the
  			 party)
		Heavy hitters.

	Aaron nods.

	They look inside.

				AARON
			(several beats; then)
		How you doing?

				TOM
			(warming)
		Great.  Network news, Washington...
		I love it.  What do you do when your
		real life exceeds your dreams?

				AARON
		Keep it to yourself.

				TOM
		You know the other day I really wanted
		your reaction to how we did with the
		Libyan report -- I was going to ask but
		I guess I feel a little intimidated with
		you.

				AARON
		Oh, stop it.

	On Tom's reaction.

				AARON
		You can't talk about feeling
		intimidated when you're on top of
		the world.  It's unseemly.

				TOM
		I'm not buying into any of that.  I
		have a load to learn.  I'm not going
		to act as if...

				AARON
			(finishing for him)
		You have the job you have...

	The sudden debate is important to Tom -- but it's moving too
	fast for him.

				TOM
		Shut up a second...

				AARON
			(amiably)
		Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't
		it, pal?

				TOM
			(picking his words)
		I made one rule for myself when this
		started and I realized I was going
		to take a lot from you people because
		of being from sports...

				AARON
		And the rule was...

				TOM
		Never to pretend to know more than
		I did.

				AARON
		Can you name all the members of the
		Cabinet?

				TOM
			(flustered)
		Okay, let's drop it.  I didn't mean
		I'd take a test for you -- I mean if
		that came up in conversation I'd...

				AARON
		We're conversing...Oh my, the names
		of the entire Cabinet has slipped my
		mind.  What are they?

	Tom is getting pissed.

				AARON
			(compromising)
		Don't name them.  Just tell me if
		you know.

				TOM
		Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of
		the Cabinet.

				AARON
		Okay.

	A beat.

				AARON (cont'd)
		All twelve?

				TOM
		Yes.

				AARON
		There are only ten.

	Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it
	isn't a little infectious.

				TOM
		You're feeling good, aren't you?

				AARON
			(sincerely)
		I'm starting to... We may do
		the capitols of the states.

				TOM
			(dry)
		Fifty, right?

	Aaron almost smiles.

	Tom enters the party leaving the door open.

	LONG SHOT

	Aaron in the f.g. -- his BACK TO CAMERA... Beyond him
	Tom being approached... then joining Jane.

	EXT. JANE'S STREET - NIGHT

	As Tom's car comes to a stop.

	INT. TOM'S CAR - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm so exhausted.  Punchy.  Sick
		tired.  I can't think and I can't move.
		I'm just a dead lump of poured out
		flesh.
			(then)
		Would you like to come up?

	Tom thinks -- then:

				TOM
		Maybe we could just sit here --
		talk a little?

				JANE
		Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?

				TOM
		Too many smart people in one room --
		it's not healthy...

	Jane's confused by this.  She looks at him.

				TOM
		I'm going to have to do a story
		from beginning to end on my own.

				JANE
		Eventually.  Does it have to be
		right now?

				TOM
			(nodding)
		Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this
		unless it was absolutely necessary.
		I have an idea for something.

				JANE
		What?

				TOM
		I just read about it in a magazine
		and it affected me.

				JANE
		Well, what is it?

				TOM
		If I tell you, can you manage not
		to put it down or tell me why it
		won't work or is in bad journalistic
		taste or anything like that?

				JANE
			(broadly)
		Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.

	He turns towards her -- about to stick his chin out.  Hesitates.

				JANE (cont'd)
		I promise.

				TOM
		It's about women who are attacked
		by someone they know on a date...
		'Date-rape,' that's the piece...
		Well?

	Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

				TOM
		Okay -- good move.  Keep it there.

	She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car,
	opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out.
	She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth.  Laughing from 
	behind her door and runs for it.

	ON TOM

	His spirits lifted.

	ON JANE

	Behind the door, trying to hide the glow in her eyes.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings... Jane's hand bounces off her nightstand to
	turn on the light knocking over and breaking the clock radio
	instead.  Three alarm clocks stand next to the clock radio...
	Finally the light comes on.  Jane's voice is so thick with
	sleep the words she utters are just barely distinguishable.

				JANE
		Hello.

				TO
			(uncertain)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Hello...Who is it?

	INTERCUT:

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				TOM
		I'm not sure I dialed right --
		Jane?

				JANE
		Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you?
		Is this Tom?

				TOM
		Yes.

				JANE
		I had to sleep fast so I took two
		allergy pills to help me...I'm
		sorry...Hey, you called me.

				TOM
		It's not important.

				JANE
		Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha.
		I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't
		tell -- how embarrassing for me.
		Gosh.

				TOM
		What pills did you take?  You
		sound more like someone on a general
		anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak
		to you tomorrow.

				JANE
		Nooo.  Is it your story?

				TOM
		No.  Are you going to the
		Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?

				JANE
		Why, you need me for the story?

				TOM
		No.  Were you going to you?

				JANE
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		Maybe I'll get off work.  I'd like
		to go.

				JANE
		Oh, good.

				TOM
		We can go together.


				JANE
		So you like me, huh?

				TOM
		I like you as much as I can like
		anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Tom editing a piece with Bobby -- He also has a little typewriter
	table set up.  He is reading from the page in the typewriter as
	he looks at the piece he has written.

				TOM
			(reading)
		But cops on the street continue to
		view it as...
		Shit -- too long.  But street cops
		say...that fits.  That last cut work
		for you, Bobbie?

				BOBBIE
		Yes, and thanks for asking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	As the regulars watch the Evening News, in particular the Date
	Rape piece which is now in progress.  Tom anxiously eyeing Jane
	out of the corner of his eye as she watches the monitor.  Her
	face impossible to read as she studies the screen.

	ON MONITOR

				UNIFORMED COP
		What can you do?  If a woman invites
		a man in and he says they uh, had
		sex and she says he raped her and
		then you find out they've been out
		together two, three times...how can
		you prove a crime?

	NEW SHOT ON MONITOR

	Tom and a woman of about thirty -- dignified but fragile -- she
	looks like someone who might be cast for a church production
	of "Glass Menagerie."

				YOUNG WOMAN
		It will be a year next month since it
		happened...I never thought I'd talk
		about it outside of counseling...

	ON NEWSROOM

	As Aaron enters the scene.

				AARON
		Hi.

	He is shushed by every woman in the room, accepts this and takes
	up a position near Tom and Jane to watch them.

	ON MONITOR

				YOUNG WOMAN
		We'd gone out twice and I hadn't
		enjoyed myself that much but it gets
		to a point -- I don't know if you can
		appreciate this but where you don't
		want to sit home or be with your
		girlfriends and people had always been
		telling me that I was 'too picky.'
		I'm not.  It's just you want to meet
		a nice guy...So anyways, it was that
		'give-him-a-chance' thing.  No, it
		wasn't.  I was lonely.  So we went
		to a movie and when he brought me home
		he said could he just come up and have
		one beer and then he'd go.  How do you
		say 'no', to that?  So first it was
		this wrestling match which was awful
		enough because it got to be really
		a fight...because I'm a modest person...
		then he ripped my clothes and he 
		forced me to...make love.  He stayed in
		my apartment and forced me more times
		-- he didn't leave until...
			(she has started to cry)
		I promised myself I wouldn't cry...
		It's just hard not to --
			(ruefully)
		You sure have a sympathetic face.
			(she cries a bit more)
		...I was so sure I wouldn't do this --
		but the whole thing messed me up --
		maybe more than it should...

	ON MONITOR

	As the news piece cut to:  Tom's face -- he turns clearing a tear
	from his eyes.

	ON NEWSROOM

	These watching struck -- perhaps embarrassed but riveted.  Aaron
	is aghast.  Aaron approaches the set.

				AARON
		Can I turn on the news for a second?
		...Oh, wait a minute.  Sex -- Tears --
		This must be the news.

	Tom stares daggers at him as a public official appears on the
	monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				PUBLIC OFFICIAL
		I don't think you can overestimate it --
		on any given Saturday night tens of
		thousands of women are being attacked
		and there isn't much they or we can do
		about it...

				TOM
			(on monitor)
		The victims often remain too terrified
		to talk -- the police powerless and all
		the social welfare groups can finally do
		is monitor this epidemic of crime without
		punishment.  This is Tom Grunick in
		Annandale, Virginia.

	As his piece concludes.

	NEWSROOM

	Tom continues to glare at Aaron.

				AARON
		I'm in a pissy mood.  I'm sorry.

				TOM
		What's wrong with it?

				AARON
		Nothing.  I think you really blew
		the lid off nookie.

	Blair moans with displeasure.  Aaron exits scene.  Others start
	to congratulate Tom on the piece -- in the b.g. on the:

	MONITOR

	We SEE frozen wilderness -- men digging in the ground -- clumps
	of people watching them work.

	ON JANE

	Probing her own ambivalence -- or, to be more accurate, working
	towards a positive stance.

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		Nice work...
			(checks watch)
		I've got to get a crew off the clock.

	She starts off -- Tom stopping her.

	ON TOM AND JANE

	Now off a bit by themselves.

				TOM
		So what did you think?

				JANE
		It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I
		really did.  It was unusual for you to
		cut to yourself when you tear up -- and
		that might not have been my choice...but
		it's real and it got me...and I think a
		lot of the time I'm too conservative about
		that kind of stuff.  Okay?

				TOM
			(enormously pleased)
		Yeah.

	He walks back towards the area of the monitor.

	ON MONITOR

				JENNIFER
		Tomorrow the jury returns to this
		site as each day brings more revelations
		of horror, four more bodies now taken
		from the frozen earth...This is Jennifer
		Mack in Wota Hamlet, Alaska.

	INT. NEWSROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER (SPRING) - DAY

				BLAIR
		Ernie's been looking for you.

	As Aaron walks to his office.

	INT. AARON'S OFFICE - DAY

	As he enters and finds Ernie bent over his desk.

				ERNIE
		Oh, I was just writing you a note.
		What do you say we take a walk?

				AARON
			(puzzled)
		Outside?

				ERNIE
		Yeah --

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

	Ernie is silent... He's having difficulty.  Aaron is feeling knots
	form.  Finally Ernie breaks his silence.

				ERNIE
		I don't know if we have any
		younger man more respected in our
		operation than you.

				AARON
		Just tell me what's really going
		on.  I think we know each other
		well enough for me to expect that.

				ERNIE
			(agitated)
		We know each other well enough
		for me to care how I put something
		to you which could wipe you out.
		So I will phrase things the way I
		think they should be phrased.  All
		right?

				AARON
		Wipe me out?

	Ernie sits on a bench.

				ERNIE
		Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...

				AARON
		Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really
		appreciate bluntness.

				ERNIE
		Upper management thinks you're dull.

	Aaron deflates.

				ERNIE
		Aaron, I've never seen them like
		this -- I think Paul's nervous
		about his own job and for some
		reason he thinks you only appeal to...

				AARON
		Wait.  Bullshit me a little...I'm
		beginning to appreciate it.

				ERNIE
		I'm no suggesting the worst will
		happen...but someone with your
		brilliance gets nibbles about other
		jobs and maybe, the next time that
		happens, down the road -- you should
		look into it.

				AARON
			(emotional)
		Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My,
		God.  They want to fire me.

				ERNIE
		All I know is that they've got to
		fire a large number of people...
		and they're not going by seniority.
		There's a recklessness in the air.  
		They...

				AARON
			(interrupting)
		Do one thing to me?  Get me one shot
		at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've
		never seen me do it.  I think it could
		turn them around.

				ERNIE
		I could do it this Saturday -- everyone
		wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.

	Aaron turns -- his spirit lifted by the unexpected ray of hope.

				AARON
		Do it then.

				ERNIE
		Please prepare carefully.  This
		couldn't come at a better time.

				AARON
		Prepare what?  You have Saturday's
		news handy?

				ERNIE
		It's been a while since you read
		the news -- I'll have somebody work
		with you.  Just on superficial
		performance things.

	Several beats.

				ERNIE (cont'd)
		Please.

				AARON
		Okay.  I think I'd better be alone
		for a while.

				ERNIE
		I understand.  I'll go with you.

				AARON
		Thanks.

	INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT

	Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in
	his hand.  An unmanned camera is pointing at him.  Tom
	is standing a few feet further back studying him.

				AARON
		This is uncomfortable for me --
		because, well, I don't mean it as
		a knock, but we approach this
		differently.

				TOM
		We sure do.  I don't mean it as a
		knock either.
			(he smiles)
		Go ahead.  I'll just say what I think
		and you can disregard it if you want.

				AARON
		It just might not work for me because
		of our different approaches.

	Tom nods and gestures that he proceed.  Aaron begins reading
	the news.  Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.

				TOM
		Wait.

				AARON
		What?

				TOM
		Your coat jacket is rising up in 
		back.

	Aaron ignores the tip.

				TOM
		When you sit down -- sit on your
		jacket a little -- that gives you
		a good line.  Look at yourself in
		the monitor.

	Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news.
	Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves
	behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.

				AARON
			(very uncomfortable)
		I don't like being handled.

				TOM
		Sit on it!  Now look.

				AARON
		Just don't physically...
			(he sees himself in the
			 monitor and is suddenly
 			 enthusiastic)
		Fantastic tip -- fantastic.

	He starts to read again.

				TOM
		No.  That's not going to tell us
		anything.  Let's get this prompter
		going.

				AARON
		It's not loaded.

				TOM
		I'll find some copy.  Be right back.

	Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the
	genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from 
	helping out.  Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in 
	tow.

				TOM
		I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up
		the camera and I got Master Control
		taping so you can study it later.

	He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.

				AARON
		Hey, Tom...

	Tom turns.

				AARON
		I'm very appreciative.

	SAME SCENE - LATER

	Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from
	various angles.  He interrupts.  Aaron reading from the prompter.

				TOM
		No.  No.

				AARON
		No?

				TOM
		Don't let your eyes go from the
		beginning of the sentence to the end
		like that.  You don't want to look
		shifty, do you?

				AARON
		Oh, God, no!

				TOM
		And the left side of your face is the
		good one.  Go again.  And try to punch
		one word or phrase in every sentence --
		punch one idea a story.  Punch -- come
		on --

	Aaron does same with the story he is reading...

				TOM
		Good...very nice.

	Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode.  Punching the
	first words.

				AARON
		Thank you for the compliment, Tom.

	He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the
	next story.

				TOM
		Try not to move your head or wrinkle
		your forehead...this is good, very
		good...

	EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT

	Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom.  He is facing
	his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.

				TOM
		You were smokin' toward the end there.

				AARON
		The pointers were great.  I'll study
		the tape.

	Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker
	room pep talk:

				TOM
		And remember -- you're not just reading
		the news or narrating.  Everybody has to
		sell a little.  You're selling them this
		idea of you.  You know, what you're sort
		of saying is, 'trust me.  I'm, uh,
		credible.'  So whenever you catch yourself
		just reading...stop and start selling a
		little.  So long.

	He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly
	uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder
	pads clipped to her bra-straps.  She is obviously running a little
	late.  Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that
	it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal
	gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights.  The DOORBELL
	RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace...
	Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful
	of neckties.

				AARON
		I spilled some rum on the outfit you
		picked out.  Let me show you the
		alternates.

	She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.

				JANE
			(into phone)
		Tom...why don't I meet you there?
		I've got some last minute stuff I've
		got to take care of...Hey, how did
		you resolve your dilemma -- did you
		rent the tux or buy it...I knew it.
		How much?  Wow...Okay...See you
		there...

				AARON
		I didn't know you were going with him.

				JANE
		Did you bring your grey suit?

				AARON
		Yes...I was thinking that way too...
		Which tie?

	She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that
	she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking
	over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie
	collection.

				JANE
			(the clasp in place)
		Thanks.  Try this one.

	She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag --
	puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag
	full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a
	built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into
	the mist.  ON Aaron's reaction:

				JANE
		I read about it -- that's how you can
		make sure you don't put on too much
		perfume...

				AARON
		Could you at least pretend that this
		is an awkward situation for you --
		me showing up while you're getting
		ready for a date.

				JANE
			(flaring)
		It's not a date.  It's co-workers going
		to a professional conclave.

	Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box
	of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight
	of a taxi stand.

				JANE
			(on phone)
		How long will it tale you to send
		one?...

	She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.

				JANE
		You look terrific.

	Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:

				AARON
		Really?

	Jane nods.

				AARON
		Because this is important -- so don't
		just be polite.  I'd really like to
		look...what's the word I'm looking for?...

				JANE
		As good as humanly possible.

				AARON
		Yes.

				JANE
		Well, the line of the jacket -- No
		really....just very nice...just right.
		I wish I could be there.

				AARON
		Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little
		before 11:00, drop by the studio.

				JANE
		I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...

				AARON
		If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll
		wait for you at my apartment.

				JANE
		Okay, great -- good luck.

	Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.

				AARON
		Thanks, Jane.  Have a good time tonight.

				JANE
		You too.

	Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.

				AARON
		I'd hug you, but why risk mussing
		either of us?

	She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark
	from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her
	shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving
	his look while diminishing her own.  She gets in the cab.

	AARON'S P.O.V.

	Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed
	instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron
	turns and walks off.

	INT. CAB - NIGHT

	Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.

	EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT

	A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's
	men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where
	they can finally assert their own glamour.  Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.

	INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT

	As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse,
	the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes.
	A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.

				MAN ONE
		The L.A. times is a great outfit.  Best
		severance pay in the business.

	Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to
	his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.

				MAN THREE
		He was lecturing me and finally
		I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse
		to look at it as a negative that
		I'm young and my news appeals to
		people my age.

				WOMAN
		And it's not like he just didn't
		hire a twenty-six-year-old producer
		himself.

				MAN
		No kidding, twenty-six.

	Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several
	people nervously.  More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from
	conversations of both substance and expedience.

				ANONYMOUS OLDER MAN
		Remember Brinkley's great line
		-- "It's as irrevocable as a
		haircut."

	Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The floor below.  Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters
	of people from around him but he works his way easily through them
	as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed,
	women's pulses throb.

	ON JANE

	As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile
	and move."  Which is exactly what he's doing.  Then a contract
	with the gods.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		If he doesn't see me soon, we're not
		supposed to be together.

	ON TOM

	Seeing her.  -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the
	meaning of which is not lost on Jane.  He is acting like her
	boyfriend.

	ON JANE

	Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a
	joyous pretty young woman.

	ON TOM

	Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.

				TOM
			(excitedly)
		It's incredible who's here.

				JANE
		Who?

				TOM
		Me!

	She laughs.  Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes
	his arm instead.

	INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT

	Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing.  He
	takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over
	to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)

				AARON
		Want to look at this?

				W.N.P.
		Sure.

	George Weln appears...

				GEORGE
			(to Aaron)
		What are you doing here?

				AARON
			(feigning casualness)
		The weekend news...anchoring...
		anchoring the weekend news.

				GEORGE
		Way to go.

	Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.

				W.N.P.
		This is terrific news, Aaron.  It's
		a pleasure to read.

				AARON
		Thanks.  Oh, there's water on the set,
		isn't there, in case I get an attack
		of cotton mouth.

				W.N.P.
		Sure.  You'll be fine.

				AARON
			(feeling patronized
  			 and repelling)
		I'll be fine!  Yes!!  I know!!!

	INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT

	Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring
	the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass
	through the metal detector.  The line moves slowly -- Jane and
	Tom several couples back.

				OFF-CAMERA VOICE
			(o.s.)
		Can I have your autograph for my wife?

	Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.

				TOM
		How you doing, Paul?

				PAUL
		So this is why you wouldn't do the
		Weekend New, you can't turn down
		a free meal.

				TOM
		Yes, born to party.

	Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within
	herself.

				PAUL
		I'll see you two inside -- I think
		we're all at the same table.
			(sotto to Jane)
		You're finally learning to be flexible.
		Glad you changed your mind about Tom.

	He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it --
	she pulls him back.

				JANE
		I'm sorry.  I don't want to go in
		there and sit with everybody.
			(imagining it)
		I can't...why don't you go?

	He considers this option as she waits.

				TOM
		Suppose I go in for a little while and
		you wait in the lobby-bar.  How's that?

				JANE
		Good.  That's it...See you.

	She walks off.  He runs a few steps to stop her.

				TOM
		Jane.

	She turns.

				TOM
		You're not going to take off on
		me, are you?

				JANE
		Uh-uh.

	She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens,
	anxiety flows.

	ON TOM

	Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing
	simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.

	FULL SHOT

	Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him.  He moves
	past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.

				TOM
		I just want you to know that my
		giving up the Correspondents' Dinner
		puts tremendous pressure on you.

	Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life
	threatens to be good.  And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of
	the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered
	hand.  As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.

	INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

	WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around
	the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands
	ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter
	machine.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Twenty seconds.

	ON AARON

	Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look
	at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN.  She starts
	off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her
	footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot
	on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of
	them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten seconds.

				AARON
		How many?

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Ten.

				AARON
		Okay.

	He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens,
	resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has
	been denying him for years.  We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE
	in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones...
	"...with Aaron Altman."

				AARON
			(on TV)
		Good Evening...In mood and language
		better suited to an espionage novel
		than the delicate world of the Western
		Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary
		today pounced on what he termed, 'The
		nest of profession spies and amateur
		traitors who were turning NATO
		Headquarters into an instrument whose
		only true function is folly.'  We begin
		our coverage with Edward Towne in London.

	Aaron looks up -- takes a breath.  He's done well -- he's
	punched his words and his one thought for the story.  His gaze
	has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire.
	He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow --
	brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He
	beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs --
	then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Gee whiz.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her
	box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted
	section appears behind him.

				AARON
		...the sub-bases referred to are
		located in five countries...

	And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the
	Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter
	as they look at a large monitor.

				AARON
		France, Belgium, the Netherlands,
		Spain as...

	And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he
	pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup
	Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself...
	Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.

				AARON
		We well as Great Britain...Our own
		State Department was rocked not only
		by the revelation but from the highly
		unusual persistence from the State 
		Press Corps.  Martin Klein reports on 
		the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.

	Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now
	showing distinct sweat stains...

				AARON
		Help me.

	The Makeup Woman picks up her Kleenex box -- then thinks
	better of it...

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Someone finds me some big towels.

	ON AARON

	He blots his face -- some makeup streaked -- by the towel.

				FLOOR MANAGER
		Five seconds.

	ON MAKEUP WOMAN

	As she scurries away, this time entering the control room
	trotting up one stair to look at the monitor... the Director
	talking to his Camera Operators.

				DIRECTOR
		I'd go looser but we wouldn't
		see the graphic.

				TECHNICIAN
			(to other Technician)
		No -- this is more than Nixon ever
		sweated.

	The Makeup Woman now looks at the bank of monitors.

				MAKEUP WOMAN
		Can't you just die for him?

	ON MONITOR

	Aaron's makeup-streaked face.

	EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT

	Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist.
	They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up
	and then sits next to her.

				TOM
		You okay?

				JANE
		Great.

	FULL SHOT

	REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete
	abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful
	night in our capitol.  He is still holding her hand -- and
	now he notes this.

				TOM
			(loudly to himself)
		Why can't I let go of this woman?

				JANE
		Well...

	He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and
	swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid-
	air.  And then he does something he's thought about many times
	before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing
	to look at her.

				JANE
		At least kiss me when you do
		that.

				TOM
			(a grin)
		You just can't stop editing me.
		Huh?

				JANE
		This is hysterical.

	She laughs a little -- then kisses him.  They break --
	surprised and aroused and look at each other...

				JANE
		I was half hoping I wouldn't
		have a good time tonight.  You
		know why?

				TOM
		Because you're nuts.

				JANE
		Right, right -- Isn't she fun to
		tease?

	He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.

				TOM
		More and more lately when I've
		watched you in action -- seen all
		your energy -- I've been
		wondering what it would be like
		to be inside all that energy.

	She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat
	on her own cheek.  Then turns to him.

				JANE
		Right back at you.

	Several beats.

				TOM
		I don't remember saying anything
		like that -- exactly...I don't
		know why I just did.

				JANE
			(immediately at work)
		Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well,
		I can think of two reasons.

				TOM
		What?

				JANE
		Three...I just thought of a third...
		If you talk about it, you don't have
		to do it.

				TOM
		That's not it.

				JANE
		Good...Another is you're trying to
		make it all about sex and heat and
		nothing else.

	She looks at him -- he's thinking.

				JANE
		Or it's that great feeling that you
		don't want to hold anything back.
		You know, intimacy.

	She elbows him.  Tom takes in the choices -- then:

				JANE
			(suddenly)
		Oh, shit.  I'm a creep.

	She moves off the concrete wall.

				JANE
		I forgot all about Aaron.  I
		promised to stop by and see
		how he did.

				TOM
		I'd like to know.  I'll go along.

				JANE
		No.  I'll see you at your apartment
		as soon as I can.

	She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when
	out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any
	of his actions has been tinged with fury.

				TOM
		JANE!

	Thrown, she stops and turns.  He walks to her.

				JANE
		What happened?

				TOM
		Don't run off --  like everything's
		settled the minute you make up your
		mind.

				JANE
		He might be weird -- he can talk more
		freely if I go alone -- why's that so
		hard to understand?

				TOM
		It's not that it's hard.  I just want you
		to give me a minute to catch up.

				JANE
		Okay.
			(she hugs him)
		Sorry.
			(another beat)
		Don't yell at me like that again,
		you scared the life out of me.

	EXT. AARON'S HOUSE - NIGHT

	As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

	It is at the top of a flight of steps.  She KNOCKS on the DOOR.
	RINGS.  KNOCKS.  Aaron opens it.  He is wearing a sweatshirt
	and cords.

				AARON
		I was in the shower.

	She enters.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

				JANE
		How'd it go?

				AARON
		You didn't see it or speak to
		anybody?

				JANE
		No.

				AARON
		Then it went well.

				JANE
		Did it really go well?

				AARON
		Define your terms.

				JANE
		Do you feel good about it?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Do others feel that you did well?

				AARON
		No.

				JANE
		Then what was good about it?

				AARON
		I lost six pounds...

				JANE
		Aaron, will you tell me?

				AARON
		It was great...writing my little
		first rate copy, sitting on my
		jacket, punching my one thought.
		But I had this historic attack of
		flop sweat so they'll never let
		me another again.  Oh, I lost one
		of your shoulder pads -- how was
		your evening anyway?

				JANE
		What do you mean, flop sweat? --
		you're making too much out of
		it...I'll bet you were the only
		one aware of it...

				AARON
		People phoned in.

				JANE
		Stop kidding.  I want to know
		what happened.

				AARON
		I'm not kidding.

				JANE
		There were complaining phone calls
		because you were sweating?

				AARON
		No, nice ones worried that I was
		having a heart attack.

				JANE
		If all that happened, how come you're
		so chipper?

				AARON
		I don't know.  At a certain point
		it was so off the chart bad --
		it got funny.  My central nervous
		system was telling me something.
		Jane -- sweat running down my face --
		makeup falling into my eyes -- people
		turning this fusillade of blow dryers
		on me -- all so I could read
		introductions to other people who
		were covering stories which is
		what I like to do anyway.  And I'm
		chipper because you finally showed
		up.  I thought I'd cook for us.
		Tequila and eggs sound good?

				JANE
		I have to be somewhere.

	He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.

				JANE
		I told what's his name -- Tom --
		that I'd meet him.

				AARON
		Call him -- I mean it can wait, 
		right?

				JANE
			(now the plunge)
		I don't know.  I may be in love
		with him.

				AARON
			(as if he just burned
			 his hand)
		No!!!!!

	She starts for the door.

				AARON
		Don't go.

				JANE
		This is important to me.

				AARON
		Yeah.  Well...I think it is
		important for you too.  Sit down.

	She sits.  He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.

				JANE
		What?

				AARON
			(looking at her)
		Let me think a second.  It's
		tough.

	A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock...
	it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching
	into himself.

				AARON
		Aaach...Jane...
			(glancing at note)
		Let's take the part that has
		nothing to do with me.  Let's let
		me be your most trusted friend,
		the one that gets to say awful
		things to you.  You know?

				JANE
			(testy and wary
			 but fair)
		Yes, I guess.  Yes.

				AARON
		You can't end up with Tom because
		it goes totally against everything
		you're about.

				JANE
		Yeah -- being a basket case.

				AARON
		I know you care about him.  I've
		never seen you like this about
		anyone, so please don't take it
		wrong when I tell you that I believe
		that Tom, while a very nice guy, is
		the Devil.

				JANE
			(quickly)
		This isn't friendship.

				AARON
		What do you think the Devil is going
		to look like if he's around?  Nobody
		is going to be taken in if he has a
		long, red, pointy tail.  No.  I'm
		semi-serious here.  He will look
		attractive and he will be nice and
		helpful and he will get a job where
		he influences a great God-fearing
		nation and he will never do an evil
		thing...he will just bit by little bit
		lower standards where they are important.
		Just coax along flash over substance...
		Just a tiny bit.  And he will talk about
		all of us really being salesmen.
			(seeing he's not
			 reaching her)
		And he'll get all the great women.

	She is getting pissed.

				JANE
		I think you're the Devil.

				AARON
		No.  You know that I'm not.

				JANE
		How?

				AARON
		Because we have the kind of
		relationship where if I were the
		Devil, you'd be the only one I
		told.

	She's briefly impressed.  He has a point.

				JANE
		You were quick enough to get
		Tom's help when...

				AARON
		Yes, yes.  I know.  Right.  And
		if it had gone well for me tonight,
		maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all
		this...I grant you everything but
		give me this...he does personify
		everything you've been fighting
		against...And I'm in love with you.
			(realizing)
		How do you like that? -- I buried
		the lead.

	He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his
	nose.

				AARON
			(an aside)
		I've got to not say that aloud;
		it takes too much out of me.

				JANE
			(thawing)
		Sit down, stop.

	Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.

				AARON
		I've never fought for anyone before.
		Does anybody win one of these things?

	INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the
	window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and
	looks out.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	A woman walking from a car.

	ON TOM

	Momentarily thinking it's Jane.  Elated.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	It is not Jane.  The PHONE RINGS.

	INTERCUT:

	BACK TO SCENE

	As he answers and we have the following conversation between
	Jane, who is using the phone, with Aaron seen just a few feet
	away.  Tom in his apartment.

				JANE
		Hi.  It's me.

				TOM
		Where are you?

				JANE
		I can't get away just yet.  I'm 
		at Aaron's.

				TOM
		Well, when?

				JANE
		I'm not sure.  It seems like he
		had sort of a mishap on the news.

				TOM
		I know.  I taped it.

				JANE
		It wasn't as bad as he think, was
		it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or
		anything?

				TOM
		Not if you count 'Singing in the
		Rain.'  Do him a favor and don't
		treat it like a tragedy.  You want
		me to talk to him?

	Her eyes meet Aaron's.

				JANE
		Uh-uh.
			(to Aaron)
		He says you could hardly notice it.

	Aaron beckons for the phone.  Jane hands it to him, as she does
	so:

				JANE
		Don't say anything about anything.

				AARON
		Hi.  Will I ever sing again?

				TOM
		Everybody has one like that.  I
		thought it was great when you
		started to laugh at the end.

				AARON
		Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying
		up Jane, I didn't realize you two
		would be going this late.  Sorry.

				TOM
		No.  Don't worry about it.

				AARON
		I'll put her on.

	She takes the phone.

				JANE
		Hi, again.  Sorry about...

				TOM
		No.  That sounds more important.
		Let's forget about tonight.

				JANE
		I don't know if that's absolutely
		necessary.

				TOM
		I've got my father coming through
		tomorrow anyway.  I should get
		some sleep.

				JANE
			(hampered by Aaron's
			 presence)
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		I'll see you at the office.  Good night.

	Several beats of silence.  Finally:

				TOM
			(finally)
		Hello?

				JANE
		Yes.

				TOM
		Okay.  Good night.

				JANE
			(aghast)
		Good night??!

				TOM
		Jane, I'm not some chore you have
		to finish so you can stay on schedule.

				JANE
		Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots
		now -- huh?  Good night.

 	She puts the phone down.  A beat -- she looks stricken.  Aaron
	looks at her.

				JANE
		He just cancelled.  He had a
		chance to think and he
		cancelled.

	She bows her head.

				JANE
		I can't breathe.
			(aghast)
		Over a guy?!?
			(then)
		But I can't -- I can't breathe.
		Damn it!

	She gulps a breath.  Her hands on her knees, leaning over --
	another deep breath.  Aaron takes in the specter.

				AARON
		Well, Jane, it was nice of you
		to drop by.

	INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.

	ON PHONE...

	Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen
	one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc.
	Jane plays her answering tape.  It is silent -- no messages...
	She fast forwards to double-check.  Just the SOUND of blank
	tape.  She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick."  We
	HEAR a busy signal.

	ON JANE

	She hangs up the phone.  Then compulsively hits the "Tom"
	button again.  Busy.  And again.  Busy.  She considers for
	a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

				JANE
			(stopping herself)
		Be fair.

	She presses the button next to Tom's name.  Busy.  And again.
	Busy.

	EXT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S HOUSE - MONDAY MORNING

	As he picks up for newspapers dotting his lawn and opens the
	door of his car -- just as his wife calls from the door.

				WIFE
		Ernie, they're calling from work.

				ERNIE
		Tell me I'm on the way in.

				WIFE
		It's Paul.

	Ernie, just a bit concerned, walks back to his house -- the
	four newspapers thick enough to be an awkward carry.

	INT. ERNIE'S HOUSE

	A phone in the immaculate living room.

				ERNIE
			(into phone)
		Hello.  Yes...

	He holds the phone down at his side for a beat, composing
	himself in the face of a sudden and horrible turn of events.

				ERNIE
		Would there be any point to my going	
		to New York and talking to them?  Would
		there be any point in going over it with
		you?  No, I'm still coming in.

	He hangs up.

				WIFE
		What?

				ERNIE
		They fired me.

	She takes his hand and kisses it -- then hugs him.

				WIFE
			(weeping)
		How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll
		be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll
		go for a drive, have some drinks, make
		happy plans.

				ERNIE
		No.  They're firing even more people
		than they said.  Some will want to
		talk.  It could help.

				WIFE
			(timidly)
		I could use somebody to talk to on
		a day like this.
			(on his reaction)
		Sorry. Go ahead.

	He kisses her sad face.

				ERNIE
		Bye, sweetie.

				WIFE
		Okay, sweetie.

	He walks towards the door -- picks up his newspapers on the
	tray beneath the hall mirror and does a start.

	HIS P.O.V.

	In the mirror he SEES his wife making faces at him behind his
	back.  He EXITS his home without comment.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	Jane is sitting in her editing cubby -- it is past noon.  She
	rises and stands in her doorway looking toward Tom's office --
	the door is open, the room is empty.  Blair ENTERS carrying
	an armload of tapes.  She looks extraordinary.

				BLAIR
		I've got four hours of French
		demonstrations --

	Jane waves it off.

				BLAIR
		Some of it they use water cannons.

	Jane takes the tape.

				JANE
		What are you dressed up for?  Oh,
		that's right -- because the Evening
		News is here this week.

				BLAIR
		I spent a fortune on this.

	Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making
	timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's
	door.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	The door now closed.

	JANE

	She stops the tape -- summons herself.  She walks towards Tom's

	office and opens the door.  Tom is seated behind his desk.

				JANE
			(without passion)
		I kept trying to call you -- you
		never called me.  Were you just
		diddling me?  Is that it--?  I'm
		great if I'm helping your career.
			(mimicking)
		But when I'm a woman for a second, I
		get immediately fucked around by
		you.

	She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's
	answer.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

				TOM
		Jane, this is my Dad.

	And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED
	seated across from him.

				JANE
			(that quickly)
		Please forgive what I said.
			(to Tom)
		Sorry.

	As she retreats:

				TOM
		You just light up a room and leave,
		huh?

	She laughs nervously as she exits.

	TOM AND HIS DAD

				DAD
		You want my opinion?

				TOM
		The thing that's easy to miss about
		Jane is...

				DAD
		You want my opinion?  And it's okay
		if you don't.

	Tom thinks a beat.

				TOM
		Yes, I would.

				DAD
		The way she just acted is not the
		way an affectionate person acts.

	Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought
	provoking.

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	Paul arriving with Bill Rorish.  The first time we have seen
	the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh.  He has the grace
	and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on
	grace and dignity,

	He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation --
	muted and ominous.

				BILL
		Just when do you start, telling people?

				PAUL
		Almost immediately.

				BILL
		I'd like to take everyone out after
		the show.

				PAUL
		Bill...This is hard on all of us
		and it's no time for compliments.
		But I think it's extraordinary of
		you to come down here for this.

				BILL
		If we're not here for each other
		during the tough time, we're not a
		news organization.

	Blair ENTERS scene.  The smallest flicker of interest from Bill,
	but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the
	outfit.

				BLAIR
		Welcome back to Washington.

				BILL
		Thanks.

	A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.

				BILL
		I've forgotten.  Was she on the list?

	Paul nods "yes."

				BILL
		This is a brutal layoff...And all
		because they couldn't program Wednesdays.

				PAUL
			(can't resist)
		You can make it a little less brutal
		by knocking a million dollars or so off
		your salary.

	AS Bill turns:

				PAUL
		Just a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  Awful.
		It's a miserable day and that was
		some kind of totally sick-joke
		defense mechanism which does not
		indicate any of my feelings -- not
		one -- but just shows the kind of
		stress this represents for all of us.

	Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office.  Bill
	walks to Tom.

				BILL
		Hi.  It's about time.

				TOM
		Good to see you, Bill.

	AS they shake:

	INSERT

	A great handshake.

	ON MR. GRUNICK'S FACE

	touched, as he watches the networks' most prominent journalist
	greet his son.

				TOM
		This is my father.

				BILL
		Good to meet you, sir.

	ON TOM

	Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent
	journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.

				MR. GRUNICK
		Good-bye, Tom.

	He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat.  Then
	whispers in his ear.

				MR. GRUNICK
		I'm going to go back home and tell
		all your old teachers.

	Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's
	editing room.

	INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters...

				JANE
		I feel terrible about what happened.
		What did he say?

				TOM
		He -- uh -- said he liked you because
		you looked like you had -- fire and
		honesty.

				JANE
			(enormously pleased)
		No.  Did he really?

				TOM
		Yes.  Then he said a really weird
		thing...

				JANE
			(so softly)
		What?

				TOM
			(he means this)
		That it would be a treat to make
		someone like you feel better...
		He gets like that sometimes.

				JANE
		That's so perfectly...It really
		makes me feel a little faint...
			(actually woozy)
		Whooo.

	Blair enters wildly into the scene.

				BLAIR
		They canned me.  Well, my brother
		will feel great -- now he's not the
		only screw-up.

				JANE
		It's started.

	Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...

				BOBBIE
		Tom -- Paul wants to see you.

	AS Tom focuses and moves off:

	INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

	Moving with Tom.  Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he
	proceeds down the hallway.

		He'll just be a minute.

	Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door
	opens.  Paul leads out Martin Klein.  They shake hands.

				MARTIN KLEIN
		You know I'm just old enough to be
		flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'

				PAUL
		That's wonderful...what a lovely line.
		If there's anything I can do.

	They shake.

				MARTIN KLEIN
			(evenly)
		I certainly hope you die soon.

	A little smile to Tom and he's off.

				PAUL
		Tom.

	Tom enters the room.  A nervous cough in evidence as he
	crosses to a seat.

				PAUL
		We're having a severe cutback, Tom --
		17 people in this bureau including
		technical personnel and we're going
		to reorganize at the same time.
		We're going to take you out of Washington
		for a while and assign you to London.

	INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

	Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People
	are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace --
	from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:

				ANONYMOUS VOICE
		No.  I won't keep my voice down.
		Those sons-of-bitches...They are
		worse than accountants -- they
		are bad accountants.

	Tom enters scene.

				TOM
		Have you guys seen Jane?

				ERNIE
		She's in there becoming the first
		woman bureau chief we've had here.

	Tom takes this in.

				AARON
		What did they do with you?

				TOM
		They booted me out of Washington.

				AARON
		Impossible.  There's no system that
		wouldn't value one of us.

				TOM
		Why?  What did they do to you?

				ERNIE
			(pointing at Aaron)
		It's what he did.  I'm proud of
		him.

				AARON
		They told me they'd keep me because
		they could plug me into any story
		and my salary was in line.

				ERNIE
		The cost-efficient reporter.

				AARON
		So I quit.

	A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away.
	Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of
	the same sword.

				TOM
		You packing up tonight?

				AARON
		Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're
		sending you down for a while, but
		you'll make it back...Where they
		sending you?

				TOM
		London.

				AARON
			(incensed)
		London.  That's a promotion!

				TOM
			(defensively)
		I don't think so.

				AARON
		It is.  Yes -- that's where they
		had Rorish, for God's sake, before
		they made him anchor.  I can't stand
		it -- they're grooming you for it
		all and you don't even know it.

				TOM
		Hold it down, okay?

				AARON
		Can I ask you something?  You only
		had one crew on the date rape piece,
		right?

	He extends his hand.

				TOM
		Yes.  You're not going to stick
		around for the farewell party?

				AARON
		No.  I don't know how much fun it
		will be when Martin Klein and Ernie
		have to drop off their credentials
		with the security guard.

	Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a
	few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.

				AARON
		This story they won't cover.  And if
		the network doesn't cover it -- it
		must not be important so why worry.

				TOM
			(eyeing him)
		I'm going to miss you -- you're a
		prick in a great way...

	Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.

				TOM
		You know what I...

				AARON
		No, I liked the way it made me sound.
		Okay.  Be good.  So long.

	He exits.

	INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY

	AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings.
	A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel
	mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting.  His desk clear --
	he writes on a clean piece of copy paper.  He centers it on his
	desk.

	INSERT - PAPER

	"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."

	INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting.  Tom
	moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full
	of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.

	TOM'S P.O.V.

	Jane across the room hugging one person after another.

	ON JANE

	AS she embraces an older secretary.

				OLDER SECRETARY
		You know what I always wanted to
		tell you -- that...

				JANE
		Shhh.  This isn't the last time
		we'll see each other.  It's not.

	A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.

				JANE
		We'll get them back -- it's going
		to change.

	Blair is at hand as they embrace.

				BLAIR
		Except for socially, you're my role
		model.

	And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London."
	She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a
	little.  He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can
	rendezvous.

	INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY

	AS Tom enters and waits for Jane.  When she enters he closes
	the door.

				JANE
		These people -- it's all so awful.
		It just hurts physically, doesn't
		it?  Like something's wrong with
		your bones, like your organs are
		shifting inside your body.

	She looks at him expectantly.  It's not what he's feeling.

				TOM
		Maybe I haven't been here long
		enough.
			(great)
		But, hey, congratulations on the
		promotion.

				JANE
		How can you say that to me?

				TOM
		Sorry.
			(a beat)
		I can't stand here feeing bad that
		I don't feel worse.  This has happened
		at every station I ever worked for.
		Look, I think it's crazy for you to
		come in here tomorrow and start a
		new job.  I have a week to get to
		my job.  Let's get the hell away to some
		island fast and find out how we are
		together away from this.

	A beat -- Jane takes it in.

				JANE
		Well, I just think that' an extraordinary 
		proposal.

				TOM
		That's yes?

				JANE
		That's more than 'yes' -- that's
		'you bet.'

	They kiss.

	INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

	The phone rings.  He answers.

				AARON
		Hello.

	INT. JANE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

	Jane -- still at the office -- it is quite late.

				JANE
		Bastard, sneak, quitter.

				AARON
		Speaking.

				JANE
		I just found out.  You didn't say
		anything to me?  You just resign?
		Will you meet me now? -- No, now!
		I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.

	INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT

	Across the street from the bureau's building.  Aaron and Jane
	are having a beer.  They are in mid-conversation.

				JANE
		Why not try it for a few weeks?

				AARON
		Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too --
		he couldn't help.  My agent has a
		hot prospect -- the number two station
		in Portland.  The general manager says
		he wants to be every bit as good as the
		networks.  Personally, I think he should
		aim higher.

				JANE
		Tell me the God's honest truth --
		are you leaving because of me?
		Because if you are...

				AARON
		Ernie told this story.  How he used
		to write obits and when the people
		in town called him up with death
		notices, he cried.  He was till
		that way when they promoted him
		out of obits.  He says you're lucky
		if you can get out while you could
		still cry.
			(a beat)
		I should have quit this place  three
		years ago.

				JANE
		You're just trying to say all great
		stuff so I'll feel even worse that
		you're not around.

	He laughs.

				AARON
		Let's go...

				JANE
		I just want to sit here longer, I mean
		the feeling is powerful -- why's that?

				AARON
		Maybe the best part of your life is over
		and you don't want to get up and start
		the bad part.

	Jane looks at him levelly.

				JANE
		You are now required to sit here with
		me.
			(a beat; then)
		Come on...be smart for a second --
		what do you think will happen to us?

				AARON
		Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six
		years from now I'll be in town to
		collect an award representing the surge
		in foreign coverage by local stations.

				JANE
			(smile, it's like 
			 old times)
		Yes.

				AARON
		I'll be walking with my wife and two
		children -- we'll bump into you on
		the street, my youngest son will say
		something and I'll tell him...
			(deliberately)
		...it's not nice to make fun of single,
		fat ladies.

				JANE
		You won't be able to stay mad at me,
		right?

				AARON
		I hope so...
			(on her look he relents)
		No.  I'm not really mad.
			(nodding head as if
			 reciting a catechism)
		I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always
		be friends...we'll get hot for each other
		every few years at dinner and never act
		on it, okay?

	Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry.  He rises,
	walks away, then turns.

				AARON
		Jane, you know how Tom had tears in
		the piece the other night?  Ask
		yourself how we were able to see
		them when he only had one camera
		and that was pointing at the girl
		during the interview.
			(on her reaction)
		I'm fairly sure I was right to tell 
		you.

	EXT. OFFICE - NIGHT

	We LOOK THROUGH THE WINDOW as Jane enters -- in a frenzy --
	searching the stacks.

	INT. TAPE LIBRARY - NIGHT

	As she locates the cassette labelled "DATE-RAPE - 9/26 -
	EVENING NEWS - OUTTAKES."

	INT. TAPE CUBBY - NIGHT

	As she inserts the tape into the player.

	ANGLE ON JANE... AND MONITOR

	As she watches... this is what she sees...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		...but the whole thing messed me
		up more than it should.

	She cries.  We HEAR Tom.

				TOM'S VOICE
		Okay, that will do it.  You okay?

	The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman
	continue to roll as they move towards their next shot --
	at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but
	the sound continues.  The crew chatting -- mentioning
	that the tape is still rolling.

				TOM
		That's enough.  That's enough.

				YOUNG WOMAN
		I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Are you okay?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Yes, I'm sorry.

				TOM
		Don't be silly.  What are you sorry 
		about?

				YOUNG WOMAN
		The way you were looking at me, I just went.

	Tom moves through the SHOT.

				TOM
		I just need you for another minute now,
		so we can shoot from behind towards me,
		and, um...

				YOUNG WOMAN
		Uh-huh.

				TOM
		...that way we have someplace to go when 
		we cut.  And I just sit here, I nod my 
		head and look nerdy.

	Young Woman chuckles.

	Jane chuckles.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		Tom

				TOM
		Yeah.

				SOUNDWOMAN'S VOICE
		It kills me we didn't have a second camera.  
		It was so powerful seeing your reaction.

				TOM
		Really?

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Yes, it is.

				SOUND WOMAN'S VOICE
		For a second there, I thought you were 
		gonna cry yourself.  That would have 
		been something.

				TOM
			(considering, then)
		Then give me a minute...

				JANE
			(fully realizing)
		You fucking...

	As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the
	Evening News piece -- as he does so:

				YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE
		Oh, that's amazing.

	ON Jane's shocked reaction:

	EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY

	Jane's cab pulls up to the curb.  She gets out -- she is
	carrying no luggage.  She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up
	to her.  Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.

				TOM
		Look who's the organized one.
		I've got everything.

	He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows
	her he has bought them each a bathing suit.

				JANE
		I'm not going.

	He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.

				TOM
		Why?

				JANE
		I saw the taped outtakes of the
		interview with the girl.  I know
		you 'acted' your reaction after
		the interview.

	Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench.  Jane close 
	behind, stalking him.

				TOM
		I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's
		verboten, huh?  I thought since I did
		it for real the first time -- but I get
		you.  That's not the reason you're not
		coming?

				JANE
			(raising her voice)
		Of course it's the reason.  It's
		terrible what you did.

				TOM
		We disagree on how God-awful it
		was.  Why don't you come with me
		and we can disagree and get a tan
		at the same time?

				JANE
			(livid)
		Jesus, if you're glib about this
		I'm going to lose it.  I was up
		all night and...

				TOM
			(calmly)
		Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...

				JANE
		It made me ill.  You could get
		fired for things like that.

				TOM
		I got promoted for things like that.

				JANE
		Working up tears for a new piece
		cutaway...You totally crossed the
		line between...

				TOM
		It's hard not to cross it; they keep
		moving the little sucker, don't they?

				JANE
			(distaste)
		It just proves that the difference we 
		have are...

				TOM
		This is a one-way argument.  We've got
		six days; if you go and we fight and
		we hate it -- we'll come home.  If you
		don't go?  Well, that's a much bigger
		deal.  I go to London right after that.
		So, it'd be very big deal if you stay
		here.  The plane's boarding.  You're
		good at deadline.  Here's your ticket.

				JANE
			(taking ticket)
		It's amazing.  You commit this
		incredible breach of ethics and
		you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try
		and get this.  When you edited that...

				TOM
			(deliberately)
		I'm leaving now.  Gate 43.

	He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane
	stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack
	of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.

	INT. TERMINAL - DAY

	On Tom moving past the metal detector.  He too is frustrated
	-- pissed off at her.

	INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA

	Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.

	INT. METAL DETECTOR

	As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer.  She stands
	there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to
	stem the tears.  As others look on, she takes a huge key ring
	from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through
	without a buzzer and moves on.

	INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY

	Tom waiting while in the b.g.  "People Eater" busses ferry
	passengers to the plane.

	As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.

				TICKET AGENT
			(to Tom)
		This is the last one.

	Others start to board.  He sees Jane moving towards him.
	He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.

				JANE
		That's not going to be the way
		we say good-bye.  Even though I
		think what you did was rotten --
		it's not all impersonal.  You mean
		something to me.

				TOM
			(interrupting)
		You keep coming after me and
		looking down on me.  It's starting
		to make me batty.

	She looks at him.

				TOM (cont'd)
		I can't help it that they like me.
		And I like that they like me.  And
		I think there's a lot of this job that
		I do well.  What do you think it takes
		to do this job -- the way they have
		it now?

				JANE
		I don't wan to discuss work.

				TOM
		Well, let's do a special report on
		that...I mean that's news.

				JANE
		I knew what you meant.

				TOM
		What I don't know, I can learn and
		what I know, nobody can teach.
		Excuse me for saying it about myself,
		but I think it's true.
			(old habit)
		What do you think?
			(catching himself)
		Never mind what you think.

	They look at each other.

				JANE
		You're lucky I came after you so
		you got that off your...

				TOM
		Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.

				JANE
		It's okay.

				TICKET AGENT
		Sir?

	The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.

				JANE
		So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?

				TOM
			(wary but hopeful)
		You want to come?

				JANE
			(totally open)
		It's just that one of the few things
		I'm not confused about is what I
		was saying downstairs, that...

				TOM
			(giving up -- sadly,
			 finally)
		Then you should stay here.

				JANE
			(softly)
		It's better when you let me say it.

	He hugs her.  Now that it's over, they can each openly care
	for each other.  While in the embrace:

				TOM
		Take it easy.

				JANE
		Why did I have to do this to
		myself?  Watch you take off.
			(then)
		Call me if you need anything.

	He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:

				TOM
		Oh, honey.

	He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his
	paper bags of bathing suits.  The bus pulls away.

	ON JANE

	Watching him go.

	JANE'S P.O.V.

	Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very
	much as he is when on television.

	INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY

	Jane gets quickly into cab.

				CABBIE
		Good morning.

				JANE
		Good morning.
			(after collecting herself)
		Dupont Circle, please.

	The cab pulls away.

				JANE
		Don't take the beltway, because at this
		time of day there's gonna be a lot...
			(stops herself, then)
		...Go any way you want.

	She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and 
	quietly adding what she knows to be true:

				JANE
		But New York Avenue's faster.

							FADE OUT:

	FADE IN:

	EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY

	Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met.  The
	words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.

	A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the
	Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M.  Tom Grunick
	will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism
	for the '90s."

	INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

	Much the same audience, though two members of the audience
	may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen
	from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old.
	Tom is in mid-speech.

				TOM
		... when they told me Bill had decided
		to retire and offered me the Evening
		News, I thought it was the same kind
		of joke we used to pull back at the
		station -- turning off somebody's
		prompter in the middle of a show.

	Some good-natured laughter.

				TOM (cont'd)
		And then when they heard my reaction --
		they thought I was kidding.  I told them
		I'd be their anchor but I didn't want
		to be the Managing Editor -- that there
		were people better qualified than I to 
		control the content and if there 
		weren't we were all in trouble.

	The audience really enjoys this:

	SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER

	MOVING SHOT...

	The anchor teams -- leaning forward.  They love this man,
	a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap.  Imagine
	the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man
	not unlike yourself.

				TOM
		And now to something more
		important... I'd like to introduce
		my bride.
			(gestures to a woman in
			 the front row)
		Lila?

	A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.

	ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...

	Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.

	INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER

	Tom and Lila shaking hand.  Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.

	ON TOM

	As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.

				TOM
		Holy shit, Aaron.

	He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is
	uncomfortable with the attention.

				TOM
		Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.

				LILA
			(high British accent)
		Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's
		50 or so role models.

				AARON
		Hi.

				TOM
		Well, this kid couldn't possibly
		belong to anyone else.  What's
		your name?

				BOY
		Clifford...

				AARON
			(indicating Tom)
		Do you know who this is, Cliff?

				BOY
		The big joke?

	Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.

				AARON
		I'm just bringing him over to give
		Jane a look at him --

				TOM
		I thought she'd be here.  I'll
		go with you.

				AARON
		Okay.

				TOM
			(to Lila)
		I'll see you back at the hotel.

				LILA
			(cool)
		All right.

	He starts off.  She pulls him back for an urgent communication.

				LILA
		Tom, the speech was magnificent.

				AARON
		Oh, I didn't say anything about
		your speech.

				TOM
		I appreciate it.

	INT. WALKWAY - DAY

	Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along.  Tom plays with Cliff
	as they move.  The boy is delighted.  Jane is in a park -- a
	blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she
	has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.

	She HEARS her name being called.

	ON JANE

	Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom.  As 
	they reach her.

				JANE
			(to herself)
		Well, why not?
			(as they arrive)
		Hey, what is this?  My life's
		rushing in front of my eyes.

				TOM
		A picnic?

				JANE
		I thought for ol' Cliff here --
		Look at you?  You're more adorable
		than your pictures.  Look what I
		got for you.

	She hands him a toy.

				AARON
		What do you say, Cliff?

	The boy kisses Jane's hand.

				AARON
		He excels at gratitude.

				TOM
			(to Jane)
		Are you any closer to a decision?

				JANE
		I think so...They've been talking
		to me about being Tom's Managing
		Editor.

				AARON
		Really?

				JANE
			(to Tom)
		I'm going to take it.

				TOM
		What a great surprise.  I didn't
		think we had a chance.  I heard
		you wanted to stay in Washington.

				JANE
		Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll
		fly up a lot.

				TOM
		Well, we should talk.  You going to
		have time for  dinner?  I'd like
		you to meet Lila.

				JANE
		I'm sorry because I was looking
		forward to that, but I' m going
		back in a few hours.

				TOM
		Okay...It's so good to see you.

	She gives him a quick kiss.  He shakes hands with Aaron.

				TOM
			(to Aaron)
		It's nice to see you.

				AARON
		Congratulations on history's longest
		winning streak.

				TOM
		If you ever get restless in Portland,
		let me know.

				AARON
		Why?

	Tom shuffles uncomfortably.

	ON JANE

	Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the
	powerful.

				TOM
			(to Jane as he leaves)
		Bye...boss.

	Tom walks away.  He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up
	to see his son running after Tom.

				AARON
			(calling)
		Hey!  Cliff!  Cliff!

	Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.

				TOM
			(to Clifford)
		Go back to your daddy.

	The boy starts back.

				AARON
		Come on, Cliff.  Come on.

	As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.

				AARON
			(to Jane)
		So who's the guy?

				JANE
		Well, we met about three months ago.
		He works at the surgeon general office.
		He loves boating.  So, he's been 
		getting me into water skiing.

	Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure.
	Jane deliberately moves past this moment.

				JANE
		I like it!  So, doll, what about you
		lately?

				AARON
		Well -- my wife got this new job...

	He continues to talk.  As the two former colleagues catch up,
	their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and
	the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...

							FADE OUT.

1   EXT. DIRT ROAD - SUNRISE                                      1

    Dawn with her rose-red fingers rises over a dusty country
    road. A car chugs over the horizon.

                        NARRATOR
              As far as con man stories go,
              I think I've heard them all.
              Of grifters, ropers, faro fixers,
              tales drawn long and tall.
              But if one bears a bookmark in
              the confidence man's tome,
              twould be that of Penelope,
              and of the brothers Bloom.


2   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING                                  2

    The car deposits two shabby boys (10 & 13) in front of a
    country house.

    Both in black.   Each with a suitcase.

              At ten and thirteen Bloom and
              Stephen (the younger and the old)


3   INT. KITCHEN (FLASHBACK)                                      3

    The two brothers and an oafish FOSTER FATHER sit eating
    breakfast.

                        NARRATOR
              had been through several foster
              families.

    The FOSTER FATHER slaps Bloom upside the head. Stephen
    LAUNCHES across the table, tackling the dad and beating the
    crap out of him.

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              Thirty eight, all told.


4   INT. CHILD WELFARE OFFICE - DAY                               4

    CLOSE ON - A CHILD WELFARE FILE COVER

    "Bloom" stamped on it. It opens, and dozens of reports flip
    by. Under the "REASON FOR RETURN OF MINORS" field we catch
    different entries: "BEHAVIOR INAPPROPRIATE", "UNMANAGEABLE",
    "MOLESTED CAT", "SOLD OUR FURNITURE", "CAUSED FLOODING".



                                                               2

                 Mischief moved them on in life, and
                 moving kept them close.


5   EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE PORCH                                     5

    The brothers on the porch, suitcases in hand.

                           NARRATOR
                 For Bloom had Stephen, Stephen
                 Bloom, and both had more than most.

    The front door opens, and a pair of FOSTER PARENTS eye the
    brothers suspiciously.


6   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - LATER THAT DAY                      6

    A wide dusty Main Street, which the two brothers survey.

                           NARRATOR
                 Another home, another main street.
                 Stephen looked around,
                 then summed the burgh up thusly:

                           STEPHEN
                 Bloom, we've hit a one hat town.

                           NARRATOR
                 One theater. One car wash. One
                 cafe. One park. One cat. Which,
                 through some mishap, had one leg.

    The cat sits on a roller skate, rowing itself down the street
    with its one leg.

                           STEPHEN
                 Sweet Jesus. Look at that.


7   EXT. SCHOOL - DAY                                            7

    A group of children flee the school joyfully.

                           NARRATOR
                 One school, which meant one tight-
                 knit group of local well-off kids.

                                                                 3
  




8    EXT. CANDY SHOP                                                 8

     The children run out of the candy store, all slurping Rocket
     Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 Their pocket-change bought rocket
                 pops,


9    INT. CANDY SHOP                                                 9

     The brothers at the counter. Bloom watches the children go,
     while Stephen counts out pennies.

                           NARRATOR
                 The brothers,

     Stephen slaps the change down angrily and points with a
     scowl.

                           STEPHEN
                 Pixie Stix.


10   EXT. PARK                                                   10

     The children play, resplendent with their Rocket Pops.

                           NARRATOR
                 They were the `they'. All well
                 loved, rooted, happy as you please.

     Bloom and Stephen sit off to the side of the park, none too
     happy nursing their Pixie Stix.

                           NARRATOR (cont'd)
                 Always there. In every town.

     Stephen glares, flicks the Stix away like a cigarette.

                           STEPHEN
                 The playground bourgeoisies.

     He storms off.    Bloom lingers, staring silently at the
     children.

                                                                  4
   




11   EXT. FOREST                                                  11

     The brothers amble down a wooded path.     Bloom stops, staring
     into the trees.

     Through the dense thicket of foliage... the children playing.
     And one gleaming eye framed perfectly through a small open
     patch in the leaves.

     Bloom pushes the leaves aside. A girl. Golden curls.
     Summer dress. Standing in the distance on a wide lawn.

     Bloom gazes.    Stephen places his hand on Bloom's back.


12   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS                                       12

     Bloom stumbles from the trees (very much as if he's been
     shoved) and regains his footing and freezes, not shielded at
     all now from the playing kids and the girl.

                         NARRATOR
               Could he simply

                         STEPHEN (O.S.)
               Talk to her!

                         NARRATOR
               Just drop his fears and go? Leave
               his brother in the woods, and join
               the children?

     The girl makes eye contact, twisting a daisy chain between
     her tiny fingers. Bloom's adam apple convulses.

     He turns tail and runs back into the woods.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
               No.


13   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         13

     Brothers in bed. Bloom gazes window-ward. Stephen gazes Bloom-
     wise, shuffling a pack of cards.

                         BLOOM
               What's doing?

                            STEPHEN
               What?



                                                                   5

                            BLOOM
                  You shuffle when you're thinking
                  something through. So whatcha
                  thinking?

                            STEPHEN
                  Not a thing.

                            NARRATOR
                  This wasn't really true.
                  Cause in the root of Stephen's
                  psyche, something now began.
                  A seed of grand epiphany. A hook.
                  A tale.


14   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                14

                            STEPHEN
                  A plan.

     Stephen spreads out a hand-drawn flowchart on a stump, and
     talks Bloom through it.

                            NARRATOR
                  A fiction made for profit, in which
                  both boys played a part.
                  A simple con in fifteen steps.

                            STEPHEN
                  And this is where we start.

     Stephen runs his finger backwards down the connected boxes,
     each neatly numbered, stopping at #1.... "Bloom Talks To
     Girl"


15   EXT. PARK - DAY                                                 15

     Children and the gold haired Girl playing.      The wall of
     foliage where the forest begins shimmers.

                            NARRATOR
                  And then, as if a curtain had been
                  pulled back from the sky...
                  Some barrier within the younger
                  Bloom was broken.

     Bloom bursts through the trees and strides across the wide
     lawn, confident, glowing, stopping face to golden face with
     the girl.


   

                                                                  6

                            BLOOM
                  Hi.

     They talk.    They run.   They laugh.   They play.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Bloom performed his role in
                  Stephen's story to a T.

     BOX #2 on the flowchart - "Bloom wins the kids' trust"


16   EXT. TOWN SQUARE                                             16

     Bloom does indeed, sitting and laughing with a circle of
     kids, suddenly a natural born charmer.

                            NARRATOR
                  And being who he wasn't, could be
                  as he wished to be.

     The Golden Girl smiles at him.

     From the shadows of an adjacent alley, Stephen watches,
     pleased. He slinks away.

     BOX #3 - "Stephen finds a cave" dissolves to Stephen scouting
     out a cave deep in the woods.


18   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              18

     In the park, Bloom runs with the kids, laughing.

     BOX #5 - "Stephen buys supplies" dissolves to: Stephen in a
     hardware store, pointing. A flashlight, snow boots and
     several large coolers are purchased.


20   EXT. PARK - DAY                                              20

     Back in the park, Bloom says goodnight to the kids and walks
     homeward in the warm twilight.

     BOX #8 - "Stephen scouts church" dissolves to: Stephen's
     eyes poke up from behind a pew in a church. He manages to
     look devious as he snags a SUNDAY SCHOOL SCHEDULE.


22   INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT                                         22

     Bloom enters, hears running water from the bathroom. He
     glimpses down at the flowchart on the bed, scanning down to:

     Box #10 - "Bloom comes home to find Stephen filling the
     coolers"

     Stephen backs out of the bathroom trolling a heavy cooler.

                         STEPHEN
               Oh - kay. How's it going on the
               playground front?

                         BLOOM
               It's great.

                         STEPHEN
               So, on to step eleven, then.   The
               Tale. You tell them -

                            BLOOM
               Wait...

     Bloom's lip quivers, obviously conflicted.

                         NARRATOR
               Must the numbers rattle on?    Must
               the fiction end?

                         BLOOM
               I think I need more time to win
               their-

                          STEPHEN
               Bloom. They're not your friends.
               They're part of this, and this aint
               real. Remember, it's a con.
               And when it's done, we've just got
               us. And we'll be moving on.
                   (beat)

                            BLOOM
                  hermit in the woods. A one eyed,
                  steel toothed vagabond...


24   INT. ATTIC                                                24

     Back to Bloom and Stephen in the attic

                            BLOOM
                  ...with blood red eyes?

                             STEPHEN
                      (nods)
                  That's good. He stopped you coming

                  ...and told me of a cave.

                            GIRL
                  What kind of cave?

                            BLOOM
                  A cave of wonders.

                              BOY
                  Pffft ha.

                  At noon on every Sunday, there
                  appears a ball of light, which
                  flutters like a butterfly...

                            GIRL
                  A will-o-whisp?

                  So where's this cave?

                            GIRL
                  Yeah, where?


28   INT. ATTIC                                                28

                  Ah-hah. The hermit didn't say.
                  He got this greedy glinting look,
                  the filthy red-eyed leech... and
                  said he'd tell for thirty bucks.

     Something in Bloom's face falls.


29   EXT. PARK                                                 29

     The girl's bright, trusting face looking at him. A moment of
     silence. Then, triumphant, an excited boy leaps to his feet.

                            EXCITED BOY
                  Well that's just two bucks each!

     The kids all rejoice, and fist-fulls of dollars are thrust at
     Bloom. He looks almost crestfallen as his eye catches the
     girl's joyful gaze.

                            NARRATOR
                  So Sunday came...

     Children in their bright Sunday clothes run through the dark
     woods, led by Bloom.

                  ...and straight from church, into
                  the woods Bloom led.


31   INT. CAVE                                                    31

     In the dim light of a cave, Stephen overturns the coolers of
     water and retreats into shadow. A flood soaks into the dirt
     floor, as outside the mouth of the cave the group of panting
     children come into sight.

                            NARRATOR
                  They stopped. Their hearts leapt.
                  There it was.


32   EXT. CAVE                                                    32

     The children look at the craggy mouth of a forboding cave.

                            GIRL
                  Just like the hermit said!

     Deep in the cave's dark maw, a spark of light.

     The children gasp collectively.    The Girl grabs Bloom's arm.

     Bloom stares, transfixed as any of them.

     The spark becomes a glowing, fluttering point of light, which
     hangs in the mouth of the cave for a tantalizing moment, then
     recedes deeper into the gloom.

     With a cry the children, Bloom included, dash into the cave.


33   INT. CAVE                                                    33

     The light glows just around the next corner... the children
     run after it, slipping in the mud, laughing, turning the
     corner...

     And the light glows just around the next corner. They
     scramble, they slip and slide, they can't catch the light,
     but they're all having the time of their lives.

     Bloom included.    Holding the girl's hand, laughing, eyes full
     of wonder.






                                                                11

                            NARRATOR
                  For just one moment, Bloom forgot
                  himself and ran too fast.

     He puts on a burst of speed, gets ahead of the crowd.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  He'd catch the light and find the
                  treasure...

     Turning a corner, he (alone) sees the rather tawdry image of
     Stephen, flashlight in hand, shooing him back as he turns the
     next corner.

     Bloom stops running.

                            NARRATOR (cont'd)
                  But the moment passed.

     The other kids and the girl pass him, but Bloom stands dead
     still, a strange expression on his face.

     The girl turns back towards him, still running, and holds out
     her hand for him to follow.

     But he doesn't.    He stays behind, and is soon left alone.


34   EXT. PLAYGROUND                                               34

                            NARRATOR
                  They didn't catch the will-o-wisp,
                  but didn't really care.

     The muddied children walk home, laughing, while Bloom leans
     against a lamppost. Stephen appears behind him, counting
     their money.

                            STEPHEN
                  It seems to me that in the end, the
                  perfect con is where
                  each one involved gets just the
                  thing they wanted.

                            BLOOM
                  Yeah I guess so.

                             NARRATOR
                  Our fledgling thieves were
                  satisfied.

                                                                12
  




35   EXT. FOSTER HOUSE - DAY                                      35

     A front door opens, revealing a porch-full of 30 angry
     parents holding 15 muddied kids by their ears.

                          NARRATOR
                The children's parents, less so.

     The Foster Parents exchange a glance.

     QUICK SHOTS -

     Stephen is smacked.

     The wad of money is snatched from a grubby small hand by an
     angry big one.

     A telephone slams down.

     On a form, the field "Reason for return:" is filled with
     "Larceny."


36   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                           36

     Two suitcases on a bed are snapped closed and pulled away.
     The bed sits solid and vacant in the dusty afternoon
     sunlight.

                          NARRATOR
                A bitter ending? Maybe. But
                there's sweetness in the mix.

     Beneath the bed, forgotten, a piece of paper.    On it, the con
     flow-chart. Numbered boxes.

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                The brothers Bloom had found their
                calling.

     One of the boxes... number six...

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                As shown in number six.

     BOX #6:   "Cut % O'Henry's"

                          NARRATOR (cont'd)
                `Cut' meant to negotiate, `percent'
                percentage deal.

                                                              13





37   EXT. SMALL TOWN SQUARE - DAY                                 37

     Through a storefront window - rows of the children's muddy
     Sunday clothes hang, each tagged.

                         NARRATOR
               `O'Henry's' was the town's one dry
               clean shop.

     And striding out of the store beneath the `O'Henry's
     Cleaners' sign is Stephen, fifty dollars in hand, sucking a
     Rocket Pop. The OWNER leans out of the door, looking a
     little nervous. Stephen throws him back a salute.


38   EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY                                        38

     Bloom sits against a wall, suitcases beside him. Boxes of
     Rocket Pops, and one in each fist. Stephen plops down beside
     him.

                         STEPHEN
               So how's it feel?

     Bloom's eye catches the children, and the girl, playing in
     the distance.

                         NARRATOR
               In truth, young Bloom won't know
               for twenty years just how he felt.

     HONK! A `Child Welfare' car waiting out on the street.    The
     brothers pick themselves up.

                         NARRATOR (cont'd)
               And so, we'll skip ahead now in our
               story.

     Stephen tosses his Rocket Pop.

                         STEPHEN
               Let `em melt.

     The con man team of the brothers Bloom, suitcases in hand,
     strides down the alleyway.

     Stephen in front.






                                                               14

     Bloom a few steps behind, stealing one last glance back at
     the children playing in the sun.

40   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT                                         40

     Flames spread over a wall of bookshelves.

     TITLE CARD:    BERLIN, 25 YEARS LATER

     A YOUNG MAN in a nice suit and bowler hat steps in front of
     the flaming books.

                            YOUNG MAN
                  He gets the scarab, you get the
                  money, I get the girl... so in the
                  end, everyone gets everything he
                  wants.

     Three gunshots, two bloody holes in the nice suit and the
     young man folds to the ground.

     A sweaty man named CHARLESTON (40s) lowers his gun, while
     behind him the rest of the library roars in flames.

                            VOICE (O.S.)
                  Wha - Charleston, what - oh my god
                  are you... oh god he's dead,
                  Victor's dead... you've killed us!
                  We had it he was right it was all
                  in the bag and now we're dead, why?
                  Why, you stupid son of a bitch?

     The owner of the voice, a MAN a bit younger than Charleston
     in a derby cap, snatches the gun away and slaps Charleston
     hard.






                                                               15

                             CHARLESTON
                  Cause the Turk was right. After
                  seeing her, after that night on the
                  airstrip, after Cairo everything
                  changed, and he couldn't see the
                  play through that one milky eye,
                  but the Turk was right about one
                  thing, that there's nothing
                  beautiful about money. She's
                  beautiful.

                            MCGUIRE
                  This isn't happening...

                            CHARLESTON
                  He'll never have her now. She's
                  free. And I'll never see her in
                  scarlet again, her chestnut hair,
                  but it's worth the money and my job
                  and his life and the rest of my
                  life that she's free.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Charleston. I can't be here...

                            CHARLESTON
                  You're not here. Neither of us
                  are. It's Mowcher's gun.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Mowcher is at the bottom of the
                  Spree with a cowl in his neck!

     Charleston gets to his feet.

                            CHARLESTON
                  They won't find him for a week, and
                  the Albino will chalk it up to
                  Davey, he won't talk. We're clean.

                            MCGUIRE
                  Listen to you - four months ago you
                  were an investment banker! Now
                  you're nothing. The Scarab's lost.
                  The money's gone. It'll rot in the
                  Peruvian earth. It's gone.

     Charleston limps to the flaming doorway.






                                                              16

40   CONTINUED: (2)                                            40


                         CHARLESTON
               The man named Charleston you met
               nine months and a thousand years
               ago at the hotel bar in Jodhpur is
               dead. If we see each other again
               it'll be as strangers. As for the
               money... let it rot.

     He exits, leaving McGuire stooped beside the crumpled form of
     Victor. A long beat. The distant roar of an engine, tires
     squealing.

     Then through the smoky doorway steps a beautiful ASIAN WOMAN,
     early 20s. She gives a nearly imperceptible nod.

                         MCGUIRE
               Wow.

     He pats Victor, who sits up, spitting blood. McGuire looks
     to Victor and the woman for a reaction. Gets none.

                         MCGUIRE (cont'd)
               Wow is the word you're both looking
               for. Wow.

     The Asian woman nods slightly.

                         VICTOR
                   (un-wowishly)
               You're a genius, Stephen.

     For McGuire is, of course, Stephen.

                         STEPHEN
               We're a genius, Bloom.

     Just as Victor is, indeed, Bloom.   He spits.

                         BLOOM
               Tastes like tin foil.

                         STEPHEN
               So does real blood. Buy you a
               drink.

     Stephen escorts the Asian woman out, while Bloom wipes his
     lip.

                                                              17





41   EXT. HOUSE - PRE-DAWN                                       41

     A stately house in the middle of nowhere, on fire. Stephen
     holds the door of a car open, while Bloom steps from the
     flaming house.

                         STEPHEN
               "Four months and a thousand years
               ago." That's Kipling, isn't it?
               He stole that from Kipling.

                           BLOOM
               No.


42   EXT. BERLIN - PRE-DAWN                                      42

     Hazy light over the sprawling city.


43   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                            43

     A low, cozy basement level bar. A dozen people crowd it, all
     expectant in a surprise-party type way.

     A TURKISH GENTLEMAN in a white linen suit and eye patch
     raises his drink when Bloom, Stephen and the woman enter.

                         THE TURK
               Make way, make room for the
               brothers Bloom!

     The bar bursts into cheers.


44   INT. DEUTCH MARK - LATER                                    44

     A DWARF dances on the bar. Stephen plays cards with the
     Turk, an ALBINO and a small crowd of character types.

                         THE TURK
               Nine months, six countries, three
               faked deaths, for one mark. You're
               a beautiful antique, my friend.

     They clink glasses.

                           ALL
               Proust.





                                                                    18

                            THE TURK
                  One thing baffles me. The entire
                  con would have fallen apart if
                  Charleston had walked away. How did
                  you know he'd pull the trigger?

     Stephen riffle shuffles a pack of cards.

                            STEPHEN
                  Just think of any card.    Got one?

     Stephen cuts the deck randomly - 2 of spades.

                               THE TURK
                  No.

     Stephen shrugs.

                            STEPHEN
                  But if I do it enough, eventually
                  it'll work on someone. And then
                  it'll be the best card trick in the
                  world.

     Wink. The dwarf slips, plummets from the bar. Stephen kicks
     a chair across the room, into which he lands with a crunch.

                               STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Ante up.

                            THE TURK
                  It's true you never work with the
                  same crew twice?

                            STEPHEN
                  That's true.

                               THE TURK
                  Well shit.     Except for the uh, for
                  her?

                            STEPHEN
                  La Chinoise?

                               THE TURK
                  Yeah.

     Back at the bar - the Asian woman.       The CHINK.   Being hit on
     by a weasly ROMANIAN.

                            ROMANIAN
                  Yeah, I'm pretty big into anime.

  

                                                               19

     She almost imperceptibly rolls her eyes.

                         STEPHEN
               Our fifth Beatle. She knows the
               ins and the outs, and so far as I
               can tell, speaks three words of
               English.

     She taps on the bar.

                            THE CHINK
               Jameson.

                            BARTENDER
               Ice?

     She says `no' with a look.

                         THE ALBINO
               So she's with you and Bloom till
               the end.

                         STEPHEN
               Just till the wind changes.

     Stephen makes a gun with his finger and shoots at the Chink.

     She flicks a champaign flute to make a `DING!' and mimes the
     bullet bouncing off her.

                         THE TURK
               Where is Bloom?

     In the corner of the bar, in a private booth with drawn
     velvet curtains, Bloom sits alone playing solitaire. Stuck
     with a queen of hearts he can't play.

     A beautiful woman in scarlet with auburn hair pokes her face
     through the curtains.

                         ROSE
               There you are. Hiding?

                            BLOOM
               Yeah.

                         ROSE
               I've been learning.      Stephen likes
               to talk about you.

                         BLOOM
               Did he tell you the cave story?



                                                              20

                         ROSE
               Is it true?

                         BLOOM
               What else did he tell you?

                         ROSE
               I'm not going to tell it as good as
               Stephen. You two kicked around
               till your early teens, then stowed
               away on a merchant marine freighter
               and ended up in St. Petersburg,
               where you spent five years under
               the tutelage of a shadowy old
               swindler named the Diamond Dog.
               And he was your Fagin and Stephen
               was his Artful Dodger, but it ended
               suddenly and badly.

                         BLOOM
               Stephen took his eye out with an
               antique rapier.

                         ROSE
               Why did he do that?

                         BLOOM
               And then the Brothers Bloom lit out
               on their own to make their fortune
               as gentleman thieves. Sounds
               romantic.

                          ROSE
               It does.

     She pushes the cards aside and slides clumsily onto the
     table, her face inches from Bloom's, eyes closed, expecting a
     kiss.

     Bloom's eyes stay open.

                         BLOOM
               You want to know how Stephen did
               it? With Charleston?

                         ROSE
               It's not the first thing on my
               mind.

                                                              21





45   INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          45

     A replay of Bloom in front of the flaming bookshelf.

                         BLOOM (O.S.)
               He positioned me in the same spot
               where, seven years ago,
               Charleston's wife stood and told
               him she was leaving.

     The room transforms, becomes daylit, not on fire, seven years
     ago, a WIFE standing in Bloom's place.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He chose my outfit to mirror her
               suit.

     Sure enough, the colors and shape of Bloom's suit matches the
     Wife's outfit.

                         BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
               He even phonetically matched my
               final words to hers.

                         WIFE
               This is the end. Charelston, you've
               always been a dunce.

     Everything snaps back to Bloom in the flaming room.

                         BLOOM (IN FLASHBACK)
               So in the end, everyone gets
               everything he wants.

     BANG.


46   INT. DEUTCH MARK                                          46

                         BLOOM
               That's what he does, he writes his
               cons the way dead Russians write
               novels, with thematic arcs and
               imbedded symbolism and shit. And
               he wrote me as a vulnerable anti-
               hero. And that's why you think you
               want to kiss me. It's a con.

     He leaves Rose lying on the table and sweeps through the bar
     towards the exit, passing Stephen.




                                                                   22

                  I need air.

                            STEPHEN
                  Who doesn't?
                      (plays a card)
                  That's the big 2.


47   EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY MORNING                               47

     Bloom stumbles up stone steps to street level.      A THOUSAND
     YEAR OLD MAN sweeps up across the square.

     Bloom sits wearily on the curb, bowler hat in hand, shirt
     bright red with fake blood, face long as hell.

     Putting the broom aside a moment, the old man walks painfully
     across the street to Bloom. Standing nearly toe to toe with
     him, the man pulls a huge joyful smile across his grizzled
     face.

     He then smears his hand over his mug, pulling the smile off
     his face and rubbing it on Bloom's mouth. When he takes his
     hand away, Bloom plays along and has the same big joyful
     smile. The old man winks at him and walks back to his broom.

     As soon as the old man is away, Bloom drops the smile.

     Stephen paces out into the street.

                            STEPHEN
                  We missed the sunrise.    That
                  would've been nice.

     They walk across the street to the Tiergarten.


48   EXT. TIERGARTEN - EARLY MORNING                                  48

     Berlin's Central Park and zoo, dead and brown. The brothers
     stroll through the woods, Stephen a few steps ahead, Bloom
     trailing behind, lost in thought.

     Camel heads poke over a wall with `Kamelhaus' painted on it.
     Stephen throws open the wall's gate.

                            STEPHEN
                      (to camels)
                  Back to the swamps!

     The camels are unimpressed.       Bloom slouches into a bench.

 

                                                               23

     Stephen shows the deck of cards to Bloom, who nods. Stephen
     cuts the deck, shows him a card. Bloom shakes his head, no.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  At least you're honest.

     Bloom stares into space.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Alright, let's do this. Let's just
                  get it done. So first you say `I'm
                  quitting, Stephen. I'm out.' Then
                  I say...

                            BLOOM
                  `Do we have to go through this
                  again.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Then you make a show of putting on
                  your jacket and say `no I mean it
                  this time Stephen, this time I'm
                  really out.'

                            BLOOM
                  Then you say `let's have a drink,
                  and in the morning Bloom you'll
                  have come to your senses'

     Stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.

                            STEPHEN
                      (re: Bloom's bright red
                       blood stain)
                  That's a major design flaw in fake
                  blood, by the way.

                            BLOOM
                  `and we'll be moving on.'

                            STEPHEN
                  Real blood turns brown after a half
                  hour.

                            BLOOM
                  Listen to me, Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  This scotch costs more than your
                  suit.

               Listen to me.

                         STEPHEN
               And the flask stopped a bullet from
               a black powder rifle at Appomattox.

                         BLOOM
               Listen.

     Bloom bats the flask away. A camel catches it, tips its
     camel neck back and gulps it down.

                         STEPHEN
               That's my new favorite camel.

                         BLOOM
               I hate you. I hate this life, I
               hate it, I hate that you won't
               fucking listen to me for one
               goddamn second. Just listen.

     Stephen listens.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I can't wake up next to another
               stranger, who thinks they know me,
               or even wants to know me, cause I
               don't know - who - I'm thirty five
               years old, and I, I'm useless, I'm
               crippled, I don't, I've only ever
               lived life through these roles that
               aren't me, that are written for me
               by you.

                         STEPHEN
               Tell me what you want.

                         BLOOM
               Why? So you can write me a role in
               a story where I get it? You're not
               listening to me. I want a real...
               thing, I wanna do things how I
               don't know are gonna work out, a,
               I, want, a...

                       wrote that line for him)
                  Aauuugghh god!

     The camel belches.    Bloom makes a show of putting on his
     jacket.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm going away. Somewhere you or
                  even the Chink won't be able to
                  track me down, so don't try. No
                  more stories.

     Bloom tosses Stephen the bowler, and storms off.    He gets
     about ten feet, then hesitates.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I love you. Bye.

     Then goes.

     The camel nudges Stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch.
     Stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.

                               STEPHEN
                  Sorry bud.     I'm dry.

     Stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning
     mist, lost in thought.

     His hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.

     FADE OUT

     FADE IN:


49   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                49

     Beautiful green hills surround the walled medieval city of
     Ferentino.

     TITLE CARD:    Ferentino, Italy - 3 months later.

     A tiny red car inches its way across the countryside. It
     winds its way up and deeper into the city on the hill.

                                                                26
  




50   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                50

     The tiny stone porch outside a private apartment.   The red
     car's bumper pulls up, parks.

     On a small wood table, empty booze bottles and a loose pack
     of cards. Fingertips spread the cards, then the fingertips'
     owner heads for the apartment door.


51   INT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                                51

     Stephen steps in cautiously, surveys the apartment.

     A goddamn mess. Empty bottles and glasses, very little
     light. Stephen opens the curtains, light streams in the
     window. A groan of displeasure comes from the gloom.

     Bloom stirs, passed out in a hammock. Unkept beard, a few
     extra pounds. Crushed cigar hanging on his lip.

     A rotund GRANDMOTHER waddles in, cleaning up bottles and
     berating Bloom in a constant stream of angry Italian.

                         STEPHEN
               She's right, you know.

                         BLOOM
               Why are you here, Stephen?

                         STEPHEN
               Put on your face, let's eat.


52   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - LATER                              52

     Stephen guides a dressed Bloom out the door. The grandmother
     follows them, still barking angry Italian at Bloom. At the
     last moment she says a few kind words, kisses him on the
     cheek and sends them off.


53   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - DAY                                     53

     A few tables on a stone walkway overlooking the countryside.
     The red car parked nearby. Stephen eats, Bloom stares.

                         BLOOM
               How'd you find me?

                  How'd the Chink find me?

     Stephen's eyes:       "Are you joking?"

                            STEPHEN
                  How've you been?

                               BLOOM
                  Great.

                            STEPHEN
                  I've done a lot of thinking the
                  past three months. You don't want
                  out. You think you do but you
                  don't. Here, c'mere. I want to
                  show you something.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm quits, Stephen.

     Stephen stands, strolls off.        Bloom wearily follows.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Where are we going?

                            STEPHEN
                  New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                      (sighs)
                  Well lemme get my jacket.

                                                             CUT TO:


54   EXT. AN AIRPLANE ROARS RIGHT TO LEFT                              54

                                                             CUT TO:


55   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - AFTERNOON                                55

     A long private road through a tunnel of trees leads to a
     ludicrous mansion. Our trio watch it from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  Looks like an etching from a Bronte
                  novel.

  

                                                               28

     Stephen flips open a first edition Jane Eyre. The
     illustration inside is in fact an exact match, right down to
     a plaster deer in the front yard.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Huh. Look at that. Well thanks.
                  I'm gonna head back to Italy.

                            STEPHEN
                  Big money. Inheritance. Dad died
                  early, Mom died two years ago after
                  ten years fighting an illness that
                  I can't pronounce.

                              BLOOM
                  How much?

     The Chink writes a number in the snow with a stick. Just
     when we think she's done, she adds several more zeros.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Jesus.

                              STEPHEN
                  Look out.

     Stephen pulls Bloom into the trees as a cherry red
     Lamborghini roars down the private road, does an unruly donut
     and crunches painfully into a tree, kicking up a cloud of
     dust and smoke.

     Thumping bass from the audio system turns off, and from the
     dust cloud emerges PENELOPE, early 30s, beautiful but in a
     non-Lamborghini way.

     Bloom watches her through the trees, none too happy.


56   EXT. THICKET - LATER                                        56

     Off to the side of the house. They lean on the hood of their
     rental car, an old school Cadillac.

     In the background, a tow truck arrives with a brand new
     Lamborghini, and leaves towing the old one.

                            BLOOM
                  What am I doing here, Stephen? I
                  have one rule, and you've never
                  even tested it.



 

                                                                   29

                            STEPHEN
                  Stick with me.

                            BLOOM
                  No women. One rule. You know we
                  don't do women, I don't, and it's
                  not a morality thing or- a thing-
                  it's, whatever it is it doesn't
                  matter what it is, that's just our
                  rule. So what are we,
                      (RE: the rental car)
                  Did you rent a `78 Caddy?

     Stephen nods to the Chink.       Bloom nods appreciatively.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Controversial choice. So no, is
                  what I'm saying. I'm quits anyway.
                  I'll be in Italy. Drinking.

     The front door of the mansion slams, and they watch Penelope
     drag a harp around into the back yard.

                            STEPHEN
                  Penelope Stamp. Thirty three.
                  Lived at home her whole life.

     Bloom's eyes never leave Penelope.

                            BLOOM
                  An eccentric shut-in rich bitch.
                  You're not helping your case.

     The Chink silently hands Bloom a retractable spyglass, he
     watches Penelope drift atop a hill and sit on a stump.

                            STEPHEN
                  She's bored, a seed in the snow.
                  We're going to put her through a
                  grand adventure, bring her to life.

                            BLOOM
                  So this is the big plan. Lure me
                  back into things with some
                  beautiful intriguing elusive girl,
                  stir up old memories with the
                  prospect of redemption and rebirth.
                  Seriously Stephen. Amateur night.

     Bloom watches her play Clash songs on the harp.



   

                                                              30

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               I'm not saying yes. But what's the
               con?

     Stephen spreads a folded piece of paper on a tree stump, with
     a flowchart on it. Numbered boxes.

     Bloom doesn't take his spyglass off Penelope.

                         STEPHEN
               It's actually pretty simple. We're
               brothers, antique dealers, perusing
               the Americas for antiquities en
               route to someplace exciting via
               luxury steamer, say Greece. You
               tie into her and work your magic...

     Penelope plays on.


57   INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                                    57

     Very late. Bloom and Stephen in armchairs, collars loosened,
     drinks drunk. The Chink's Chuck Taylors stick up over the
     back of a chair.

     Bloom holds the con flowchart.

                         STEPHEN
               ...and so that's how it ends, in
               Mexico, a burst of violence then a
               moment of truth on the beach. What
               do you think?

     Bloom idly looks over the chart.

                         BLOOM
               You've got something up your
               sleeve. This is about me, right?
               Somehow.

                         STEPHEN
               This might not be something you
               know, but they've all been about
               you. Maybe that's why they've none
               of them been perfect, I've never
               been able to give you what you
               really want.






                                                                31

                            BLOOM
                  I want to be outta all this. So by
                  definition, this is not going to
                  give me what I want.

     Stephen answers by letting an ace fall from his sleeve.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                  This will be the last one.    You'll
                  let me go.

     The Chink's inert sneakers come to life and she's on her
     feet, silently going to Stephen's side.

                            STEPHEN
                  I will never approach you to do
                  another con again.
                      (to the Chink)
                  Let's make it a red Schwinn.

     Bloom stares at #1 on the flowchart - "BLOOM MEETS PENELOPE."


58   EXT. HILLTOP - MORNING                                      58

     A grumpy Bloom perched on the red Schwinn, an ill fitting
     Styrofoam helmet on his head.

     Stephen sits in a lawn chair watching the highway below.

     The Chink sets up a lawn umbrella, a chair for herself, and a
     cooler with Coronas.

                            BLOOM
                  There are less painful ways to cut
                  into a mark.

                            STEPHEN
                  Wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk wahk.
                  Score to beat is 7.9. Keep your
                  head in the game, the Chinese judge
                  is tough.

                            BLOOM
                  This is a banana seat, man!

     He directs this to the Chink, who blinks with innocent
     incomprehension and opens two Coronas.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Don't give me that blank look, you
                  know what a fuckin banana seat is.

 

                                                                   32

     Stephen spots something and blows a whistle.       With a grunt,
     Bloom launches the Schwinn forward.

     Gaining speed, bumping over weeds and gopher holes, down the
     steep steep hill.

     At the bottom of the hill, a two lane highway.      Cruising down
     the highway, a cherry red Lamborghini.

     Whose front right fender Bloom expertly smashes into.

                                                            CUT TO:


59   EXT. HIGHWAY / SKY - DAY                                         59

     Silent and blue. Time slows to a crawl as Bloom sails
     through the air, arcing over the Italian luxury car's hood
     and past a horrified Penelope, face frozen mid scream behind
     the wheel.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  There's actually a knack to this.
                  You want to avoid dying or breaking
                  anything that won't grow back, but
                  you don't want to roll out of it
                  and come up roses. If you're
                  trying to fast track into a mark's
                  sympathies, there's nothing quite
                  as efficient as having your first
                  conversation be from a hospital bed
                  they put you in. I usually like to
                  try for a dislocated shoulder.

     Several things happen at once.

     Bloom hits the pavement shoulder-first, hard.      The bent bike
     follows suit.

     Up on the hill, Stephen and the Chink raise score cards.         8.9
     and 5.6.

     The Lamborghini screeches to a stop.

     Everything is still.

     Then the car jolts forward. Then stops. Then again, jolts
     and stops. Rolls forward a few feet, lazily drifting, then
     jolts and stops.

     Bloom painfully stands, as confused by the car's behavior as
     us.

 

                                                                33

     Stephen and the Chink lower their cards, equally confused.

     One last long beat of silence, then the car jolts forward,
     veers drunkenly to the left, tips into a ditch and chunks to
     a stop. The horn blares.

     Bloom looks up to the hilltop for guidance.

     Stephen stares blankly.    The Chink raises a new score card -
     7.8.


60   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                   60

     Penelope sleeps, bruised and battered. Bloom sits bedside
     uncomfortably, arm in a wimpy sling. She stirs. Bloom leans
     forward.

     Slurred with sleep and drugs, she painfully barely breathes

                            PENELOPE
                  Are you alright?


61   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                61

     Bloom consults with Stephen and the Chink, both in scrubs.

                            STEPHEN
                  The Chink had it - I'm telling him,
                  I know, thank you - in her report,
                  I missed it. This is actually kind
                  of great, I'll tell you why.

     The Chink lights a cigarette.

                            BLOOM
                  You missed it?

                            STEPHEN
                  Dostoevsky was an epileptic.

                            BLOOM
                  I know.

                            STEPHEN
                  His seizures were preceded by an
                  enlightened euphoria, a sort of
                  opening of his spiritual eye.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  I think the fact that she saw your
                  face the instant before a seizure
                  is a pretty goddamn good foot to
                  start things out on, right?

     Bloom stares blankly.        The Chink burps into her stethoscope.


62   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      62

     Bloom slumps in a chair, watching Penelope sleep.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  The next step is to figure out a
                  way to insinuate yourself into
                  their personal life.

     Bloom drifts off, then wakes with a start.

     It is MORNING.     Penelope is shaking him.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think they took my car.     Could
                  you drive me home?

                                BLOOM
                  Uh.   Yeah.

     She walks away, the back of her gown wide open, then turns.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm Penelope Stamp.

                                BLOOM
                  Bloom.


63   INT. CADILLAC - MORNING                                         63

     Bloom drives, Penelope gazes stiffly out the window.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Engagement. Find a connection with
                  your mark through conversation.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I'm sorry about your Lamborghini.

                  S' ok.

     Silence. He notices her playing with the side mirror knob,
     angling it to stare at him while looking out the window.

     More silence.

                  This car is like riding in a huge
                  marshmallow.

     And still more silence.

                  Having now deftly set your hook in
                  the mark's psyche, this would be
                  the perfect time to tug the line,


64   EXT. LUDICROUS MANSION - MORNING                                  64

     They pull up in the car.          A tow truck is dropping off a new
     Lamborghini.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  Get invited in for coffee, and tell
                  them the full tale.

     Bloom looks about to launch into something, when Penelope
     drops a stack of cash bound in a green rubber band on his
     dashboard.

                            PENELOPE
                  For the bike, and the whole, thing.
                  This was a big shit sandwich. Ok.
                  Bye.

     The car door slams and she's gone.         Bloom sits a moment.

                            BLOOM (V.O.)
                  However, there are advantages to
                  playing it cool. Letting it lie
                  for a day or two, then casually re-
                  establish contact.

     Bloom starts driving off, and adjusts the passenger side
     mirror so it points back to the road. As he does he sees
     Penelope in it, sprinting after his car.

     He stops.    A moment later she appears at his window, heaving.

65   INT. PENELOPE'S KITCHEN - DAY                                65

     Bloom and Penelope sit in a luxurious stone-based kitchen,
     neither touching their coffee. Bloom talks.

     This is how Penelope listens: she starts with her eyes on
     Bloom, then very quickly drifts away into her own thoughts,
     then recognizes she's doing it and makes eye contact again
     and gives an overbaked "oh yes go on" smile/nod, then does it
     all again. Three or four times.

                            BLOOM
                  ...didn't really have anyone except
                  each other growing up, and our
                  father was in the antique business,
                  he had a shop in Charleston. So we
                  stuck together, my brother Stephen
                  and me, we and just took over the
                  shop when dad died. Then we
                  realized one day, we saw the
                  dealers who were finding and
                  selling us the antiques coming from
                  exotic countries all over the
                  world, and there was a, almost a
                  scent they had, when they'd come in
                  the dusty shop we worked nine to
                  five in since we were nineteen, the
                  air would, like before a rain, the
                  ions would line up, and you could
                  just smell midnight trains to Paris
                  and steamer ships and Calcutta
                  bazaars, and we made the decision,
                  we just did it, that we want to
                  have that sort of life. So we did,
                  and we've been travelling and
                  treasure hunting the world ever
                  since, and could you, I'm sorry,
                  stop doing - that, you're, I'm, ok.
                  Alright, look.

                            PENELOPE
                  I'm really bad at talking to
                  people.

                  No!   I want to talk to you.   Fuck.

     She storms out.

     Victorian, expensive. Penelope leans against the window,
     looking out. Sulking. Bloom enters.

                            BLOOM
                  So what kind of stuff do you do?

                             PENELOPE
                  Nothing.   Maybe you should go.

                            BLOOM
                  Alright. I'm just gonna finish my
                  coffee first.

     Very slowly, he sips it.     Each sip becomes a noisier and
     noisier slurp.

                            PENELOPE
                  I collect hobbies. I see someone
                  doing something I like, and I get
                  books and learn how to do it.

                             BLOOM
                  Hm.   Anything interesting?

                            PENELOPE
                  Not really.

     HOBBY MONTAGE

     In which Penelope demonstrates the following with exacting
     seriousness and skill for Bloom:

     Playing the piano.      The classical guitar.   The fiddle.   The
     banjo.

     Putting the finishing touches on a ship in a bottle.

     Executing a perfect ollie on a skateboard.

     Juggling various items.       Riding a unicycle.   Juggling while
     riding a unicycle.

     Playing ping-pong against a wall with ungodly speed.

     Karate chopping through too much wood.

     Breakdancing.

     Playing the accordion.

     Rapping to a drum machine.

     Creating a perfect origami dragon.

     END HOBBY MONTAGE

     On Bloom's shell-shock face.

                            BLOOM
                  Is that it?

                             PENELOPE
                  No.   I know a lot of stuff.

                            BLOOM
                  You just learned this stuff, here
                  by yourself?

                               PENELOPE
                  Kinda sad.

                            BLOOM
                  No. So you just thought, `so I
                  want to learn this and this,' and
                  you just did it? How do you plan
                  to use all these skills?

                            PENELOPE
                  I dunno. I'm not a planner. I
                  just do stuff. Here, look at this
                  watermelon. It's a camera. You
                  can make a pinhole camera out of
                  anything hollowish and dark.

                            BLOOM
                  It's gotta warp the image though,
                  right?

               No, yeah it does. That's what -
               the Taj Majal taken by a fat
               tourist with diarrhea and a point-
               and-shoot camera can be the
               flattest, dullest, "here's us at
               the Taj Majal," "Oh lovely lets go
               stick our thumbs up our asses"
               picture. But you can look at the
               most menial everyday thing, and
               depending on how your pinhole
               camera eats the light, it's warped
               and peculiar and imperfect. It's
               not reproduction, it's
               storytelling.

                         BLOOM
               It's a lie that tells the truth.

                         PENELOPE
               I dunno about truth. A photograph
               is a secret about a secret. The
               more it tells you, the less you
               know.

                         BLOOM
               What's changed between now and
               twenty minutes ago? Cause this is
               kinda like a conversation.

                           PENELOPE
               Huh.    Well shit.


67   EXT. BACKYARD - DAY                                       67

     Bloom and Penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house
     and ending up at the driveway.

                         BLOOM
               Well, I should, uh, it's late. So.
               I meet a lot of people in my job I
               have to professionally act
               interested in. It's a good feeling
               to be genuinely interested in
               someone.

                            BLOOM
                  Well next time I'm in town. We're
                  taking a steamer at noon tomorrow
                  off the docks, to the continent for
                  a few months.

     During this, Bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small
     of Penelope's back. The edge of his thumb comes to rest on a
     small slit of exposed skin.

     Penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush
     crosses her still face.

     When Bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  Paris and Greece, I think. I've
                  gotta get a hat. Thanks for the
                  pinhole camera demonstration. And
                  for the good conversation. Goodbye

     He drives off.    She stands in the doorway, watching him go.

     A jaunty steamer ship docked and ready. Bloom watches the
     access road, Stephen makes notes, the Chink whittles.

                  I need another day with her.

                  I need another day to get her on
                  the boat, she isn't hooked. That
                  bit I skipped where we were talking
                  in the backyard, it was ten minutes
                  on the optics of lensless
                  photography, we didn't really talk.

                  It isn't the talking that hooked
                  her.

     Bloom turns from the road.

                            BLOOM
                  I think you're wrong.

     A screech of distant tires and a crash.        Bloom doesn't look.

                            BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  Though every time I say that, you
                  end up being comically right.
                  That's her, isn't it? Yeah.

     Penelope pulls a clumsy steamer trunk that never could have
     fit in her Lamborghini, which is bent around a pylon.

     Bloom meets her.

     She holds out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.

                            PENELOPE
                  You left this money in my kitchen.

     He doesn't take it.

                  Well I'd never been to Greece. Or
                  Europe. Or outside New Jersey.

                            BLOOM
                  It just seems like a big leap.
                  From where you were at yesterday to
                  being a world traveler.

                            PENELOPE
                  It looked like fun.   I wanted to do

                  A new hobby.

     Up ahead, Bloom spots a large man in a fur collared cape

     Penelope to them.

                            BLOOM
                  Penelope, this is my brother
                  Stephen.

                            STEPHEN
                  Pleased to make your acquaintance.
                  Bloom's told me about you, you're
                  the epileptic photographer?

                             PENELOPE
                  Sort of.

                            STEPHEN
                  This is my personal secretary and
                  masseuse, Mrs. Yuengling.

     A nearly imperceptible glare from the Chink.

                            PENELOPE
                  Yuengling like the beer?




                                                              43

                             STEPHEN
                  Heh. No. So what are your plans
                  in Greece?

                            PENELOPE
                  I don't plan.

                            STEPHEN
                  Good for you.

     The Chink hits a damn near impossible shuffleboard shot, then
     gives Stephen a pointed deferential giggle-bow.


72   INT. STATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    72

     The brothers dress for dinner.

                            BLOOM
                  You named the Chink `Yuengling?'

                            STEPHEN
                  I was writing in a bar. And she
                  doesn't drink, how does she know a
                  Philly beer?

                             BLOOM
                  She knows a lot of stuff.
                      (beat)
                  Was that who I thought it was on
                  the East deck this morning?

                            STEPHEN
                  Yes it was. Did he spot you?

     An ominous glance.

                             BLOOM
                  Not yet.


73   EXT. DECK - NIGHT                                          73

     Several small tables scattered about the moonlit deck, Bloom
     and Penelope sit with flutes of champagne. Penelope, in an
     elegant but understated dress, shuffles a pack of cards.

                            BLOOM
                  You look very nice.

     She laughs as if at a joke she doesn't think is funny.




                                                                 44
   
73   CONTINUED:                                                   73


                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  What was your childhood like?

                            PENELOPE
                  I make cameras out of watermelons.

                            BLOOM
                  Lonely.

                            PENELOPE
                  Lucky guess.

     Penelope's hands move faster.     She knows how to shuffle
     cards.

                            BLOOM
                  How was it lonely?

                            PENELOPE
                  Fishing for an entertaining
                  childhood anecdote that
                  encapsulates my adult issues?

                            BLOOM
                  Well it's funny how everyone's
                  usually got one.

     As Penelope tells her story she gets fancier with her
     shuffles.

                            PENELOPE
                  When I turned six I started getting
                  allergies, hayfever, rashes, really
                  bad. So my mom took me into the
                  doctor, and he did that test where
                  they use needles to prick a grid on
                  your back with all the different
                  toxins, to see which ones you're
                  allergic to. The next day I came
                  in, the doctor lifted up my shirt,
                  and my back looked like a patch of
                  oily, moldy, blackish green double-
                  puff marshmallows. I was allergic
                  to everything. So they sealed the
                  house with plastic and a special
                  ventilation system, and I spent my
                  entire childhood and adolescence
                  indoors. Mostly alone. Lonely.

     She pulls the Queens out of the deck and lays them face up on
     the table.


  

                                                              45

73   CONTINUED: (2)                                            73


                         BLOOM
               Wow.

                         PENELOPE
               It wasn't `til I was nineteen they
               discovered what I was actually
               allergic to was the aluminum alloy
               the hypodermic needle was made out
               of. Then I was going to leave, but
               my mom got sick. So I stayed. And
               she stayed sick, a long time.

                         BLOOM
               Do you feel cheated?

     Penelope does an amazing card trick using the four queens.

                         PENELOPE
               The trick to not feeling cheated is
               to learn how to cheat. So I
               decided this wasn't a story about a
               miserable girl trapped in a house
               that smelled like medical supplies
               wasting her life on a dying person
               she sometimes hated. It was about
               a girl who could find infinite
               beauty in anything, any little
               thing. And do anything she decided
               to do. And love the person she was
               trapped with. So I told myself
               that story until it became true.
               Now did doing that let me escape a
               wasted life, or did it just blind
               me so I wouldn't want to escape it?
               I don't know. But either way, I
               was the one telling my own story.
               So I don't feel cheated.

     She finishes the trick.

     A single pair of hands clapping turns their heads. At the
     far end of the deck, alone at a table, the large man in the
     fur collared cape, who for reasons unlikely to become clear
     at the moment will be called THE CURATOR.

                         THE CURATOR
               And a magician is just an actor
               playing the part of a magician.   My
               compliments.

     Bloom takes Penelope gently by the elbow and guides her up
     and away.

                                                                 46
   




74   EXT. BOW - NIGHT                                             74

     They stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.

                         PENELOPE
               Who is that man? You avoided him
               earlier on the deck.

                         BLOOM
               I don't know, but he's carrying a
               knife up his sleeve and wearing a
               cape. Do me a favor and steer
               clear of him.

     A waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.

                         BLOOM (CONT'D) (cont'd)
               I don't suppose in all your hobby
               acquiring you ever learned how to
               dance?

                         PENELOPE
               I went through a phase when I was
               mildly obsessed with the Bolero.

                         BLOOM
               Give me a minute.

     He leaves her alone. Clouds obscure the moon, shadows
     deepen. She shivers.

     A match strikes.   She jumps.

     The moon re-emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck.
     The Curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.

                         THE CURATOR
               Mademoiselle.

                           PENELOPE
               Monsieur.

                         THE CURATOR
                   (in French, subtitled)
               I didn't mean to startle you.

                         PENELOPE
                   (in French, subtitled)
               Yes you did.



 

                                                               47

                            THE CURATOR
                      (in French, subtitled)
                  Apologies, but the deck was dark,
                  and I had to approach.
                      (English)
                  It's been such a time since I've
                  encountered the Brothers Bloom.

                            PENELOPE
                  You're in antiques?

                            THE CURATOR
                      (Cheshire grin)
                  Antiques. I wonder, my dear, if
                  you know the true nature of the men
                  you travel with?

     The band strikes up a Bolero. The Curator flicks his wrist,
     and a long thin blade falls into his hand.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  A little fear might suit you, I
                  think.

     He raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush,
     which he delicately employs.

                            THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                  Bon soir, ma cherie.

     With that the Curator backs into the shadows, and is gone.
     Moments later Bloom trots up to her, oblivious.

                            BLOOM
                  It isn't a Spanish band, but
                  they'll do their best.

     He hands her a single blood red rose. She puts it in her
     teeth, and they dance. If there is a tinge of tension in the
     air, the Bolero suits it.

     The moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in
     the dark.


75   INT. STATE ROOM - MORNING                                    75

     Bloom wakes with a start. Morning light pours in through his
     porthole. He opens it, looks out to sea.






                                                              48

     His dinner jacket draped over a chair. The rose in its
     lapel. He fishes it out. Runs his fingers over the teeth
     marks on the stem.

     Then raises an eyebrow at a lump in the breast pocket, and
     pulls out the stack of bills in the green rubber band.




76   EXT. DECK - MORNING                                          76

     The Chink and Penelope lie on their stomachs on the deck, a
     beer can pinhole camera between them.

     Penelope gives a lesson on how it works.

     The Chink appreciates her.


77   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK - LATER                                  77

     Bloom escorts Penelope to breakfast.

                            PENELOPE
                  How'd you find her?

                            BLOOM
                  The Chi-nese, uh, Yeungling?   She
                  found us.


78   INT. KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING (FLASHBACK)                     78

     Bloom cooks breakfast in his bathrobe.

                            BLOOM (O.S.)
                  A few years back, when we hit the
                  top of our art dealing game, she
                  just appeared.

     A door opens and slams. Bloom turns. The Chink sits at his
     place at the table, suitcase beside her, smoking a cigarette.

                            BLOOM (O.S.) (cont'd)
                  She's stuck with us. We figure
                  when she gets bored she'll vanish
                  with the same lack of noise.

     Like feeding a strange animal, Bloom pours her coffee.   She
     drinks it without looking at him.

                                                              49





79   EXT. BREAKFAST DECK                                          79

                         PENELOPE
               I like her.

                           BLOOM
               Good.

     They smile when they see Stephen and the Chink at a table.

     Their smiles drop when they see the Curator sitting with
     them. Bloom glares at the Curator, but speaks to Stephen.

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               What's he doing here?

                         STEPHEN
               I invited him, sit down. This
               ship's too small to dance around
               each other for a week, we might as
               well have it out now. Bloom. Sit.
               Penelope, do you know our friend?

                         PENELOPE
               Only as the creepy Frenchman.

                         THE CURATOR
               Book-learned. You know languages
               but not accents, my dear. I am

               Pleased to make your acquaintance.
               What do you do?

                         THE CURATOR
               I'm a curator, presently for the
               National Museum in Prague. And
               yourself?

                         PENELOPE
               I'm an epileptic photographer.

               Good for you. Boys? What do you
               do?

                  We did.   Eat your waffles.

                            THE CURATOR
                  But Mademoiselle appears...
                  confused. Perhaps she is unawares?

                            BLOOM
                  Eat your waffles, fat man.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Unaware that the Brothers Bloom are
                  in fact the two most highly
                  respected art smugglers in the
                  western world?

                            STEPHEN
                  Were. We've been on the straight
                  for three years. So that's that.

                            THE CURATOR
                  Well, if that is that, then that is
                  indeed that. As you say.

     Penelope snaps her fingers.     Everyone looks up.

                            PENELOPE
                  Your name's Melville?

                            THE CURATOR
                  Maxmillion Melville, Esquire.

                         PENELOPE
               Sorry, no, cause I noticed but I
               couldn't place it, this ship is the
               Fidele, which was the ship in
               Melville's novel "The Confidence
               Man." So that's weird.

     Everyone glances at Stephen, a little uncomfortable.

                         STEPHEN
               Huh.


80   INT. DECK - NIGHT                                         80

     Bloom paces, Stephen shuffles cards.

                         BLOOM
               I know you like to throw those
               clever little details in, but
               you've gotta watch that shit with
               her Stephen. She had a lot of time
               alone in that house, and she used
               it. She did the best Double Dutch
               Queens I've ever seen up on the
               deck last night.

                         STEPHEN
               Double Dutch Queens uses gaffed
               cards.

                         BLOOM
               She had them in her purse and cut
               them in while I was folding my
               napkin.

                         STEPHEN
               Jesus.

                         BLOOM
               That's what I'm saying. She's
               different, she knows, sometimes it
               feels like she knows everything.
               Doesn't that worry you?

                         STEPHEN
               No. But something about her is
               worrying you plenty.

                         BLOOM
               She feels like one of your
               characters.



                                                                   52

                  The day I con you is the day I die,
                  Bloom.

                             BLOOM
                  I know that.
                      (beat)
                  How did you get the Belgian, on our
                  budget?

                            STEPHEN
                  He's beautiful, right?

                            BLOOM
                  I didn't expect him to actually be
                  Belgian.

                            STEPHEN
                  I'm not sure he is.   I'm to bed.

     Stephen stands to go, then pauses.

                            STEPHEN (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                  I've always protected you, right?
                  The only real danger in this whole
                  play is that you'll actually fall
                  in love with her. Look at me.
                  Don't fall in love with her.


81   EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS                                     81

     The Chink sits smoking her whittled pipe, watching Bloom
     alone on the deck. Stephen passes her, and she stops him
     with a look.

                             STEPHEN
                  Shut up.   I know what I'm doing.

     She hands him a thin piece of paper.       He looks it over.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  This came through just now?

     The paper is a telegram with the Fidele's imprint, received
     from St. Petersburg. Stephen reads it.




    

                                                                   53

                  Dog.

     He crumples the paper, looks down at Bloom.

                            STEPHEN (cont'd)
                  Wire him back for me. "Dear Dog

     Bloom and Penelope lie on the deck, watching dolphins.

     She says this word like she's eating chocolate:

                            PENELOPE
                  Smugglers. It's like an adventure
                  story. Whose idea was it to go
                  straight?

                            BLOOM
                  Mine. Stephen always loved the
                  life. Then he was almost killed on
                  a run to Jakarta, two thugs with
                  heads like canned hams worked him
                  beyond all reason.


84   EXT. JAKARTA PIER - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)                          84

     Stephen is set upon by two thugs.    He rushes them.

                            STEPHEN
                  Have at thee, you ham headed
                  bastards!

                         BLOOM
               And I called it, that was it.

                           PENELOPE
               Scary.

                         BLOOM
               For me. Stephen enjoyed it. He
               loved the idea that we were
               internationally infamous art
               smugglers, but I think deep down,
               same as me, he felt like we were
               putting on a persona, faking it.

                         PENELOPE
               Telling a story.

                         BLOOM
               He'd love to die on a job.
               Cornered at midnight on a run to
               Jakarta. That's his dream, to tell
               his story so well it fulfills
               itself. It somehow would make it
               finally real for him.

                         PENELOPE
               That's kinda the thing we all want,
               right?

     He looks at her in the sun.

                         BLOOM
               Trying to get something real by
               telling yourself stories is a trap.
               Trust me on that one.

     Kalamata, if it matters.

     The Fidele docked in bright blue water. Our intrepid heroes
     stand aside a dusty road, surrounded by their luggage.

     The Curator approaches, tips his hat to them.

     With a wink, he is gone.     A beat.   Penelope stands apart.

                            BLOOM
                  My French is a little rusty, but I
                  believe he just told you `my offer
                  stands.'

                  Whatever's in his pipe, it made me
                  thick.

     He brings her face close to hers, smoke twisting, and speaks
     unheard words low and fast.

     ancient wall, into...

                  Yeah. Medieval art bores the crap
                  out of me so I don't know it that
                  well. So that's what he does, he
                  makes pieces in his collections
                  disappear, then sells them off via
                  a trusted middleman.

                  Probably his Spanish guy, right?
                      (asks Penelope)

                  Not bad.

                            PENELOPE

                  The Curator? That's a relative

                            BLOOM
                  I'm sorry you had to deal with that
                  guy.

                  Let's do it. Let's, just, I want
                  to try this. Let's be smugglers.
                  I think it'd be fun. We should do
                  this.

                  million dollars.

                            PENELOPE
                  I do, I've got, that's whatever.   I
                  mean a real reason.

                            BLOOM
                  This is real, it's dangerous, it
                  could go very bad.

                            PENELOPE
                  I think a little real danger might
                  suit me. I'm gonna do it.

               So if you want to join my smugglers

     She walks off towards the taxi.

                         BLOOM
               This is not an adventure story.

                         PENELOPE
               What are you talking about?    It
               totally is.


94   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           94

     A train roars through the night towards Prague.


95   INT. STEPHEN'S SLEEPING CAR - NIGHT                          95

     Stephen reclines, hat on his face.    Bloom paces.

                         STEPHEN
               Take it easy. She's having fun,
               that's the point of this.

                         BLOOM
               She's making a flag for our
               "smugglers gang," man. She made me
               learn a secret smugglers handshake.
               Unhealthy. This afternoon, when
               she was writing, in the observation
               car? A letter? A journal? No.
               She is getting way too into this.

     Bloom fishes a crumpled piece of paper from his pocket and
     thrusts it in front of Stephen's face.

     On it are written dozens of variations in stylized fonts of
     "Penelope the smuggler."

                         BLOOM (cont'd)
               She's been singing the Smuggler
               Song since Athens.

                         STEPHEN
               What Smugglers Song?




 

                                                                59

                  You know, the one from whatsit, the
                  Disney thing, that Smuggler Song,
                  the `We're a band of smugglers hey,
                  la la la la la, we smuggle by night
                  and drink by day, smugglers ho, ho

                  isn't... there isn't a Smuggler
                  Song, is there? Ok. She made up a
                  Smuggler Song. With hand motions.

                            STEPHEN
                  The whole point of this was to
                  sweep her off her feet. Let her
                  enjoy it.

                            BLOOM
                  While it lasts.

                            STEPHEN
                  Nothing lasts.

     Exit Bloom.    Stephen sighs and drops his hat back on his
     face.


96   INT. BLOOM'S SLEEPING CAR                                    96

     Bloom reads. Footsteps pound by outside. Penelope and the
     Chink run past his door. A moment later a uniformed
     ATTENDANT runs past.

     A beat, then the footsteps come back, and the girls duck into
     Bloom's cabin, slamming the door. Sacks in their teeth.

     Off Bloom's quizzical look:

                               PENELOPE
                  Smuggling.     From the snack car.

     They pull bags of chips and tiny liquor bottles from their
     sacks.

     Bloom glares at the Chink, who tries to avoid his gaze.


97   INT. SNACK CAR                                               97

     Bloom pays the SNACK CAR ATTENDANT from a stack of Euros,
     while the Chink gives him counts on her fingers.

                  Jameson.

                            BLOOM
                  I'm not paying for that.

     She holds up two fingers, the Attendant pours two.

                             ATTENDANT
                  Ice?

     She says no with a look, they drink.

                            BLOOM
                  She made up the Smuggler Song.

     The Chink nods.      Bloom pays for the Jameson.

                            BLOOM (cont'd)
                  I thought it was a Disney thing.


98   INT. PENELOPE'S SLEEPING CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT              98

     The lights are off. Penelope reclines on the bed, surrounded
     by empty tiny gin bottles. Drunk.

     Bloom sits on the floor, both framed in a big window looking
     out on a breathtaking moonlit landscape rolling hypnotically
     by.

                            PENELOPE
                  Gin is fuckin fruity. Have you
                  taken this train before?

                             BLOOM
                  Yeah.

                            PENELOPE
                  So this is all like fuckin
                  `whatever' to you.

                            BLOOM
                  I usually drink with the Chink in
                  the snack car, play cards.

                            PENELOPE
                  With the who?

                  Mrs. Yeungling. That's her
                  smuggler nickname.

                            PENELOPE
                  That's offensive.

                            BLOOM
                  I think if it were offensive to
                  her, she'd let us know.

                            PENELOPE
                  Do I get a smuggler nickname?

     Bloom quietly slips the stack of cash in the green rubber
     band into Penelope's luggage.

                            BLOOM
                  No.

                  I think you're constipated.   In
                  your fuckin soul.

     Bloom makes several attempts to form a response to this
     before giving up.

                            BLOOM
                  What?

                            PENELOPE

                  petrified poop up your ass, I'm

                  you know what? I'm a fuckin
                  smuggler. If that's your thing,
                  fuckin tell it like you own it.

                  front of your feet, man, fuckin
                  jump into it and dance the shit out

                  much. Enjoy the fuckin ride.
                  Fuck.

     A roll of thunder and spectacular flash of lightning ignites
     the landscape, and rain starts to patter. Penelope stiffens.

      Another crash. Lying on her stomach, Penelope slowly starts
      feeling something which makes her undulate. Bloom stares,
      confused.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Whoa ha. Oh ho ho. Ohhhhhh whoooo
                ha ha ha ha.

      Beneath her, the train wheels rhythmically clack and vibrate
      against the tracks. Another flash of lightening, the rain
      falls harder.

      Penelope writhes.   Bloom silently shrinks back in terror.

      The door to her car latches, and Bloom is gone.

      Bloom sits drinking and playing cards with the Chink.    He
      spaces out, she snaps her fingers to wake him up.

      BLAST takes out a chunk of the landing beside his head.

      They all dive onto the floor, piling on top of each other.

      The Curator stands in the smoky apartment hallway, sloppily
      draped in a ratty bathrobe, bottle in one hand and shotgun in
      the other. He squints at them.

      A schematic of the castle laid on the kitchen table. The
      Curator looks even worse in the light, red rimmed eyes, heavy
      skin on his face.

                             THE CURATOR
                   The book is already stolen. The
                   stealing is in the bureaucracy, in
                   the filing, red tape. As far as
                   the museum is concerned, the book
                   does not exist. I am the curator,
                   I walk in, pinch the copy girl's
                   baboosh, put the book in a
                   briefcase and walk out. Tomorrow,

                             THE CURATOR
                   Today is not a good day.

                             STEPHEN
                   Tomorrow. Now what about this
                   Argentinian.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (blank, then realizes)
                   Ah, the Argentine? Senor Luise
                   Belguta Rioso. I get his file.


108   INT. CURATORS APARTMENT BEDROOM - LATER                     108

      Penelope and Bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an
      array of beautiful paintings on the wall.

                             PENELOPE
                   Gin is slow death, man.

      Stephen and the Chink poke their heads in, leaving.   The
      Curator strolls in.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'll see you back at the hotel.
                       (glances at the Curator)
                   Soon.

      They go, leaving Bloom and Penelope, who squints at an
      unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval
      forest clearing. It sits at the foot of an unmade bed.



 

                                                                    66

                             THE CURATOR
                   From a private collection on the
                   island of Ikaria. That one.

                             BLOOM
                   Who painted it?

                             THE CURATOR
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   Why is it the last thing you see
                   every night, and the first thing
                   you see every morning?

                             THE CURATOR
                   That's a story. You have a minute?

      He closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the
      painting. Setting the stage.

                             THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                   My daughter travelled with me when
                   she was very young, and I'd show
                   her the places and the art, all the
                   most joyous and terrifying things
                   in the world.

      Memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the
      sun.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   I wanted that the world was alive
                   in the most fantastic way for her.
                   To built her a pair of wings. Make
                   these things real. But maybe more
                   than any other objet d'art, she
                   loved to hear she'd ask to hear the
                   story of the stone golem. From a
                   painting in a small private
                   collection on the island of Ikaria.

      He motions to the painting, and we move into it. As he tells
      the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still
      images, which we move across like a picture book.

                             THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                   Well Rachel, like most monsters the
                   Golem was once a human. A boy,
                   about your age.

                          THE CURATOR (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                And one day the boy was walking
                home, and he quarrelled, he fought,
                with a good friend of his. They
                got very angry and his friend
                pushed him a certain way and the
                boy fell and struck his head and
                died. The boy's friend was very
                sad but also very frightened. So
                instead of telling the boy's
                parents, he did something awful.
                He pulled the body into a quarry, a
                pit of broken rocks, and hid the
                boy beneath a pile of large stones.
                Well. Years went by, and the boy's
                friend became a young man, and one
                day while drinking in town (which
                in his guilt he did quite a lot of)
                he heard that a well was being
                built near the forest... with the
                stones from the quarry. He ran to
                the quarry to find it nearly
                empty... no stones, no body. He
                ran to the well where the masons
                were finishing their work. `Did
                they find anything strange in the
                quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe
                hoping they'd arrest him for the
                awful crime on the spot. But no,
                they said, motioning to the well.
                Nothing strange. Just stones.
                They left him alone there at the
                well, and he stood looking into it
                as the sun fell behind the
                mountains and twilight set the
                world in a deep, still silence.

      The last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing.

      Its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence
      that follows.

      Then, with a piercing ROAR, a living monster of stone lunges
      out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by
      the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar
      pulls him back down into the depths of the well.

      Silence again. We pull out of the painting, back to the
      Curator, sitting very still.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                My daughter died nineteen years ago
                today. She was six. She went out
                to play one afternoon and vanished.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                The next morning we found her, in a
                stone well on a neighboring
                property. I climbed down to her,
                but slipped and broke my leg, and
                while we waited for the rescue team
                to pull us out she died in my arms.
                If you've had a child... my whole
                everything just focused down to one
                thing, to hold her and make her
                feel safe. But no matter what I
                said to her, I couldn't stop her
                shaking, crying. Her last moments
                on this earth were filled with
                terror. Of a stone golem.

      He stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It was the first painting I
                `acquired.' I keep it maybe hoping
                some night the golem will come for
                me.


109   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER                   109

      Bloom trots out, ahead of Penelope.

                          THE CURATOR
                Mademoiselle.

      Bloom keeps going, anxious to leave, but Penelope lingers on
      the staircase. The Curator comes out.

                          THE CURATOR (cont'd)
                It is you I do business with, yes?

                           PENELOPE
                Right.   Oh, right.

      She gives him the envelope with the certified check. He
      shakes her hand, then deftly adjusts his grip so that just
      for a moment he holds her hand as you would hold a child's.

      He lets go, and smiles apologetically.

                             THE CURATOR
                Au revoir.

                                                                 69
   




110   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAY                                  110

      Penelope and Bloom stroll home in silence through crowded,
      vibrant cobblestone streets.

                          PENELOPE
                You aren't constipated. You're
                scared. What are you scared of?

      They walk on, suddenly somehow holding hands.

      As they approach the hotel, Bloom deftly breaks their hand
      holding off. Penelope notices why.


111   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        111

      Stephen, up in the window watching them approach.   He recedes
      into the room.


112   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                                112

      The sun sets against the castle, taking us into night.


113   INT. PRAGUE HOTEL BAR - NIGHT                              113

      Bloom drinks alone, sketching Penelope's face with a pencil.
      A smell breaks his concentration.

                          BLOOM
                Diamond Dog, carrying a cup and a
                cane.

      Standing behind him, a soft old man in an ashy suit and
      eyepatch. The DIAMOND DOG.

                           DIAMOND DOG
                Bloom. How long has it been?
                     (sits, orders)
                Tea.
                     (to Bloom)
                Can you believe that? Tea? Been a
                long while.

                          BLOOM
                If I call Stephen down he'll kill
                you.





                                                                  70
    
113   CONTINUED:                                                  113


                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Well then please don't call Stephen
                   down. Look at you, you're
                   terrified. C'mon now, look. Take
                   a look. I'm an old man with no
                   depth perception. You don't have
                   to be scared of me.

      The Dog plays with a heavy gold lighter, making sparks.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   It's been a funny thing, watching
                   you boys take what I taught you and
                   eclipse me. I'm so proud to be a
                   footnote in the lives of the
                   Brothers Bloom. And you hate me.
                   The curse of all bad fathers - that
                   my presence on this earth after I
                   die will not live on the lips of
                   admiring men, but will sink into
                   the murky backwaters of my
                   children's psyches.

                             BLOOM
                   Is this profundity?   Cause you can
                   skip it.

                              DIAMOND DOG
                   Ha!   Ha ha. Piss and vinegar.

      The Dog scoots next to Bloom.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   When I first took you boys in,
                   showed you the ropes, haunting St.
                   Pete's, piss and vinegar. I still
                   crave that youthful joy. Even
                   today.

      The Dog's hand touches Bloom's leg.     There is something
      horrible about this.

      Beneath the bar, Bloom grips the sharp pencil like a knife.

                             BLOOM
                   Don't touch me.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   You probably won't believe I loved
                   you boys very much.



   

                                                               71

                          BLOOM
                You're going to take your hand away
                or I'm going to break your arm,
                there's nothing between.

      He does, but Bloom's fingers don't loosen on the pencil.

                          DIAMOND DOG
                But love, you know. We know, folks
                like us, you can always blink and
                realize that it's a fiction, and
                like Peter walking on water or
                Wiley Coyote running off a cliff,
                if you look down in doubt you'll
                fall. That's the price of our
                lives, the wax in our wings. One
                day Stephen's going to fall. It
                may be glorious, but he's going to
                fall hard and he won't be there to
                tell you what to do and protect
                you. When he's gone, remember me.

      The Dog has moved in very close to Bloom, his breath hot on
      his face, and his hand comes to rest fully on Bloom's leg.

      Bloom's hand with the pencil quivers, about to strike-

      When Bloom is pulled from the bar stool by a heavy hand.
      Stephen, his eyes burning through the Dog.

                          DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                Hello Stephen.

      Stephen smashes a bottle from the bar and slashes it across
      the Dog's hand.

      Waiters and porters tackle him, the Dog howls, holding his
      bleeding hand. Bloom stands numb, and puts the pencil in his
      pocket.


114   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL - NIGHT                                  114

      Bloom watches the Dog get into a waiting black Mercedes. For
      an instant the car's interior light shows an 11 year old boy
      behind the tinted glass, as the Dog slides in and puts his
      arm around him.

      The Mercedes drives off.

                                                                72
  




115   EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - NIGHT                               115

      Right in front of the hotel, on the water. Bloom sips coffee
      from a china cup, spinning a paper in his hands. Stephen
      joins him, with a matching cup.

                          STEPHEN
                I'm sorry I wasn't there.

                          BLOOM
                You can't always be there.

                          STEPHEN
                No, I guess can't.

      A beat.

                          BLOOM
                That was a real tonal shift.    The
                Curator's tale.

      On one side of the paper is the sketch of Penelope, on the
      other is the con flowchart. "#12 - The Curator's Tale."
      "#14 - Castle Break-In."

                          STEPHEN
                I'm a big fan of tonal shifts. I
                didn't write it for him, though.

                          BLOOM
                He made it up on the spot?

                          STEPHEN
                I don't know.


116   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                           116

      Bloom flops into bed.   He turns and looks at the wall.

      Right on the other side of it...


117   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                   117

      Penelope lies in bed, looking at the wall also.   She closes
      her eyes.

                                                                  73
    




118   INT. BLOOM'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                             118

      Bloom's breathing slows.   He closes his eyes.

      A beat. Then light snoring breaks the silence, coming
      through the wall. Penelope snoring.

      Bloom smiles slightly.   What a cute snore.

      The snoring deepens slightly.

      The clock on the wall advances from 1:30am to 5:50am, and
      through the window the horizon glows with the approach of
      dawn.

      Bloom lies wide awake on his back, red rimmed eyes wide open,
      the guttural snoring ringing in his ears.


119   INT. APARTMENT STAIRCASE - MORNING                          119

      Our four at the Curator's door. Bloom knocks, and they all
      step judiciously back. No response.

                           STEPHEN
                Max?

                          BLOOM
                We're a little early...


120   INT. THE CURATOR'S APARMENT - MORNING                       120

      Still and silent in the breaking light of morning.

      And totally empty.   Picked clean down to the bare walls.

      The only thing left in the apartment is the painting of the
      well... broken on the floor.

      Our intrepid four stand in various states of thoughtfulness.
      Penelope stares at the painting, Bloom at the window.

                          PENELOPE
                The Golem came for him. In my
                dream. Crawled out of the painting
                and killed him in a horrible way.






                                                                74
  
120   CONTINUED:                                                120


                             BLOOM
                   Well at least he had the decency to
                   just skip out on us, not do
                   something tacky like fake his own
                   death.

      Poking around the room, Bloom opens a closet. The Curator
      stands pressed against the back wall in his pajamas.

                             THE CURATOR
                       (sotto)
                   You're a little early.

      Bloom quickly closes it.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't get it. If he was
                   hightailing it he could have waited
                   eight hours till we traded the
                   million for the book, and had some
                   traveling money. Well. Back to
                   antiquing. Nothing gained, nothing
                   lost.
                       (to Penelope)
                   And you got to see Prague, which is
                   nice.

      Penelope's eyes widen with realization.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.

                             BLOOM
                   You should stay in the city for
                   awhile, they have these amazing
                   puppet show opera things-

      But Stephen raises a hand to shut him up.

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh?


121   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - DAY                                     121

      Several empty glasses of wine, one full one in Penelope's
      hand. All heads are slumped.

                             PENELOPE
                   Oh.





                                                                    75
      
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121


                             BLOOM
                   It's my fault. I can't believe I
                   left you alone with him.

      The Chink hands Stephen a piece of paper.       He glances at it.

                             STEPHEN
                   The check was cashed yesterday
                   afternoon, he'd have deposited it
                   in a Swiss account. I'm sorry Pen.

                             PENELOPE
                   What a waste.

      Bloom puts his hand on her arm, sympathetic.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor man. What a waste.

      Bloom's expression turns quizzical.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   That poor Argentina man. He'll
                   never see the book now, it'll just
                   rot in the catacombs. What a
                   waste.

      When Penelope lifts her suddenly brightened eyes in a moment
      of divine inspiration, Bloom meets her gaze with fear.


122   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE, PRAGUE - DAY                             122

      Bloom paces, Penelope looks up at the castle with binoculars.
      The Chink and Stephen stand by.

                             BLOOM
                   No. No no. Can't you see what
                   happened here, there is no book,
                   we've been swindled -

                             PENELOPE
                   But maybe there is, maybe it's
                   real, we don't know!

                             BLOOM
                   It's not real, it's a con.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's my money, I'm going to find
                   out for sure. He gave us every
                   piece of information we need.

  

                                                                  76

      She spreads the castle floor plan out on a bench.

      Bloom turns to Stephen and the Chink with a "this is crazy
      right?" expression and gesture. They give him nothing back.

                             STEPHEN
                   We'd need to clear the
                   administrative offices.   Some sort
                   of disruption.

      The Chink strokes her chin in mock-thoughtfulness.

                             PENELOPE
                       (to Bloom)
                   C'mon. Help me break into this
                   castle. It'll be fun.


123   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                            123

      A Barbie Doll set up in the middle of the field explodes in a
      theatrical plume of fire.

      Several others follow suit.

      The Chink pops up from behind a mound of dirt in her aviator
      goggles, cigarette dangling from her lip. She leans on a
      detonator plunger.

      Bloom, Stephen and Penelope crouch nearby, watching her work.

                             STEPHEN
                   She's an artist with nitroglycerin.
                   It's kind of her thing.

                              PENELOPE
                   I feel like I want to know more
                   about her.



                    BLOOM                            STEPHEN
      Yeah.                             Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   Check the tat.

      On the back of the Chink's neck, a few finely scripted lines
      of Chinese.






                                                                77
  
123   CONTINUED:                                                123


                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   An inky wisp of personal
                   information. We transcribed it,
                   brought it into a Chinese
                   restaurant.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's it say?

                             BLOOM
                   The literal translation is
                   something about water cranes, but
                   essentially it means "When you're
                   done with something, blow it up."


124   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - EVENING               124

      The Chink lies on the floor with Penelope, showing her how to
      build a tiny remotely detonated bomb. She slices a tiny bit
      off a brick of dynamite, sets it in a petri dish with a
      detonator, and puts the whole thing in a handbag.

      Penelope appreciates her.

      Bloom and Stephen hunker over the castle floorplan.

                             STEPHEN
                   There's a smoke detector in these
                   empty rooms in the east tower. So
                   we plant and set off a tiny -
                       (to the Chink)
                   TINY tiny, tiny charge.

      The Chink clicks a seemingly innocent ballpoint pen. With a
      BEEP, a tiny poof of fire plumes from the handbag setting it
      on fire, and the smoke rises to the ceiling.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Fire drill ensues, offices empty,
                   and you'll have exactly four and a
                   half minutes to get through the
                   access hatch, into the catacombs,
                   get the book and get out before the
                   fire department arrives.

      Penelope and the Chink do their elaborate handshake, and she
      gives Stephen and Bloom a finger snap thumbs up.

                                                                  78
    




125   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER                             125

      Bloom and Penelope, up late at the table.     Going over the
      floorplan one more time.

                          BLOOM
                So straight down the corridor,
                again, tell me where.

                          PENELOPE
                Second left, third right, access
                hatch behind the copier, I need to
                sleeeeeeep...

                          BLOOM
                The abort code if we need to abort
                is "corned beef." For some reason.

                          PENELOPE
                Bloom, I need to sleep.

      He folds up the plans, she wraps up the brick of dynamite and
      bomb components and spots a black leather backpack beside an
      open handbag on the table.

                          PENELOPE (cont'd)
                Is this Yeungling's backpack?

                            BLOOM
                Yeah.

      She gently puts the brick of stabilized nitroglycerin inside
      the front zipper compartment, and sets the tiny petri-dish
      bomb beside the handbag.

                          PENELOPE
                You know what I feel?

                            BLOOM
                Horny?

                          PENELOPE
                Scared. All my big talk.       But this
                isn't a story, it's real.      Fuckin
                scary.

      She kisses him.    He kisses her back.






                                                                 79

      The pure whole hearted sensuality with which they attack each
      other and the deluge of almost child-like need let loose in
      this one simple act quickly reaches a point where as a viewer
      we no longer feel comfortable intruding with our gaze.

      Fifteen seconds after this point, we FADE OUT.


126   EXT. PRAGUE - DAWN                                         126

      The sun arcs into the sky above the castle.


127   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN                   127

      Bloom half wakes.

      Across the landscape of the bed, Penelope sleeps.   Sunlight
      on her body and her sleeping face.

      Distant KNOCKING.     From the next room over.

      Bloom's eyes snap open.    He scampers.


128   EXT. PRAGUE HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - DAWN CONTINUOUS           128

      In his boxers, holding trousers and shirt in his teeth, Bloom
      swings over the ledge from Penelope's window into his.


129   INT. BLOOM'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - DAWN CONTINUOUS           129

      He opens the door for Stephen, who regards him narrowly.

                             STEPHEN
                   Ready?


130   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                130

      The Chink picks up the backpack, handbag and petri dish bomb.


131   INT. PENELOPE'S PRAGUE HOTEL ROOM - MORNING                131

      Penelope folds a plastic bag and puts it under her jacket.


132   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                         132

      A little alcove with a good view of the castle.

      Stephen trains his gaze on one set of windows high in the
      Eastern tower. Bloom paces.


133   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                        133

      An empty storage room, half under construction. The Chink
      walks in, wearing the backpack and carrying the handbag. She
      goes straight for a spot just under a smoke detector.


134   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                   134

      Stephen, Bloom and Penelope are joined by the Chink.

                              STEPHEN
                   Ok.

      He looks through his binoculars again.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright?

                              PENELOPE
                   Ok.

      They share a brief moment with their eyes, and Penelope trots
      off. The Chink caught it. She looks at Bloom slyly.

                             BLOOM
                   For the record, I'm still against
                   this. Why send her in alone?

      The Chink finds a way to casually smell Bloom's fingers.

                             STEPHEN
                   Because going in alone is a very
                   important thing to do. She's
                   walking into a zero security
                   tourism office during a fire drill
                   and taking a five hundred dollar
                   manuscript replica from a utility
                   crawlspace. Worst case scenario, a
                   file clerk asks if she's lost.
                   Which isn't even going to happen.
                       (to the Chink)
                   She's in position.

      He spots Penelope casually waiting beside an unmarked door.

      Bloom notices the Chink looking at him with a knowing grin.
      She mimes sealing her lips and tossing the key.



                                                                       81

      She then takes the ballpoint pen detonator... out of the
      handbag dangling at her hip.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Cause nobody's going to know we
                   were ever here.

      Bloom spots the handbag.         Something's not right.

                               BLOOM
                   Uh-

      The Chink clicks the pen.


135   INT. EASTERN TOWER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             135

      The black backpack, sitting under the smoke alarm, beeps.


136   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - CONTINUOUS                        136

      A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION blows a massive ten foot wide chunk
      out of the side of the Eastern tower, spewing a painfully
      dramatic ball of fire and debris.

      Screams.   Shouts.      Panic.

      Our three look up at the tower, agape.

                               THE CHINK
                   Fuck me.

      Bloom grabs the binoculars from Stephen, looks for Penelope.


137   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                      137

      Panicked tourists stumble away from the descending dust.
      Penelope sees what's happened, but holds her ground.

      The unmarked door opens, and a dozen business people pour
      out.


138   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                               138

                             BLOOM
                   Don't do it don't do it Penelope
                   don't-



     

                                                                  82
    
138   CONTINUED:                                                  138


                             STEPHEN
                   They're locking down the castle,
                   she won't get in.


139   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 139

      She takes a step towards the door.


140   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          140

      Bloom drops the binoculars and sprints.


141   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 141

      A burly SECURITY GUARD trots across the courtyard, herding
      tourists and smoking a cigar.

                             SECURITY GUARD
                   To ze back, no panic, to ze back...

      He blocks the office door, and sets his cigar down for a
      moment. Penelope spots it.


142   EXT. CASTLE ADJACENT STREETS - DAY                          142

      Bloom nears the courtyard, sees Penelope up ahead.

                             BLOOM
                   Pen! Don't - abort!   Corned beef!
                   Corned beef!


143   EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD - DAY                                 143

      Penelope deftly spins the cigar 180 degrees.

      The Guard absently picks it up and puts it back in his mouth,
      fire-side first. He howls, doubles over.

      She dashes into the door.

      Bloom bursts out of the crowd and lunges for the door, but a
      SECOND SECURITY GUARD stops him.

      Dozens more security guards swarm in. Overhead, an army
      helicopter buzzes by. Bloom stares into the doorway,
      helpless and scared.

                                                                 83
   




144   INT. TOURISM OFFICE HALLWAYS - DAY                         144

      Water rains down from the ceiling sprinklers.   Penelope
      weaves through the halls.


145   INT. COPY ROOM - DAY                                       145

      Cramped, ill lit, and with its own sprinkler.

      Penelope dashes in, shoulders the massive cold war era copy
      machine and with a Herculean effort pulls it away from the
      wall.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm in Prague. I burned a man's
                lips off to break into a castle in
                Prague.

      Revealing an access hatch.


146   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            146

      Tiny, earthy.   Penelope shuts the hatch behind her.

      Light from a barred window illuminates a rectangular shape
      lying on a stone slab. Penelope approaches the small BOOK OF
      HOURS reverently.


147   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                  147

      A full view of the castle reveals just about the worst case
      scenario. The entire area swarms with army helicopters and
      tanks, soldiers with rifles, yellow tape, news crews.

      Stephen, Bloom and the Chink sit behind the police line on
      the bridge with the rest of the crowds. Heads in their
      hands.


148   INT. CRAWLSPACE                                            148

      Penelope is broken out of her stupor by heavy footsteps all
      around her, soldiers searching the castle.

      Voices right outside the hatch.   She slides the wimpy little
      bolt shut. It rattles.

      She looks up - a moldy vent in the muddy ceiling.

                                                               84
 




149   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY                                149

      Bloom suddenly stands.

                          BLOOM
                Wait. Wait, we're fine. She's
                fine. If the soldiers find her
                wandering the halls they'll assume
                she's a clerk, they'll just shoo
                her out. So as long as she doesn't
                do anything suspicious, she's fine.


150   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    150

      Penelope wriggles on her belly through a tin ventilation duct
      barely big enough for her. The book, encased in the plastic
      bag, hangs from her teeth.

      Sounds of soldiers searching the offices come from below her.

      Up ahead she sees a point of light. With a gleeful grunt she
      shimmies faster - she's nearly made it!


151   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                         151

      A dozen SOLDIERS and the CHIEF OF POLICE have their eyes (and
      guns) trained on the tin ventilation duct above their heads.

      It is very very obvious not only that a person is crawling
      through it, but exactly where that person is.

      The Chief of Police pointedly coughs to get her attention.


152   INT. VENTILATION DUCT                                    152

      Penelope freezes.   A beat of silence.

      The tin gives way, and she plummets...


153   INT. TOURISM OFFICE - DAY                                153

      ...hitting the ground hard, then springing to her feet and
      through some knee-jerk primal instinct kicking a nearby
      soldier in the head.

      Eleven rifles cock and aim at her.




                                                                    85
      
153   CONTINUED:                                                    153


      And that's how she's caught, frozen in a kung fu stance,
      plastic bag in her teeth.

      She locks eyes with the Chief of Police.      Lets the bag drop
      from her teeth.

      And opens her mouth to speak.


154   EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - AFTERNOON                               154

      The hubbub has died down considerably, soldiers march away
      from the castle in formation. Bloom Stephen and the Chink
      sit watching for some sign.

      Three police cars, sirens blazing, drive down the length of
      the bridge.

                             BLOOM
                   The Chief of Police.

      As the last one passes, Bloom sees the Chief of Police riding
      shotgun, and Penelope sitting with a soldier behind caged
      mesh in the back seat.

      His face falls.

      Then Penelope spots him, points and says something.

      Very suddenly, the police car stops.

      The Chief of Police gets out.       Nods at our intrepid three.

      And opens the door for Penelope. As she climbs out he
      motions for the passing soldiers to stand at attention and
      salute her.

      He kisses her hand.

                             CHIEF OF POLICE
                       (in Czech)
                   It has been a privilege, madame, to
                   behold even briefly such a strong,
                   beautiful flower.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Czech)
                   Thank you sir, I will not soon
                   forget your kindness.

      She blushes and smiles, then does an unhurried victory strut
      back to Bloom, Stephen and the Chink.

  

                                                                    86
      
154   CONTINUED:                                                    154


      The police cars drive off.

      Penelope pulls the book out from under her jacket and sets it
      on a bench. A moment of victorious silence.

      Clapping her hands, she does a little shuffle dance of joy.

                              PENELOPE (cont'd)
                       (sings)
                   We're a band of smugglers hey,
                   la la la la la,
                   we smuggle by night, drink by day,
                   smugglers ho, ho ho...
                   Everybody!


155   EXT. SIDEWALK BAR - LATE AFTERNOON                              155

      Bloom and Stephen sit among empty wine glasses.

      The Chink approaches, gives Stephen a hand gesture.

                             STEPHEN
                   Let her sleep. Train doesn't leave
                   till eight.

                             BLOOM
                   That was real.

                             STEPHEN
                   Yeah, I know.

                             BLOOM
                   Fuckin scary.


156   EXT. PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                                      156

      Bloom walks pensively through a green park. Cat Stevens'
      "Miles from Nowhere" plays from a nearby radio.

      His eye catches something.       A shiny red apple on a fruit
      seller's cart.

      He approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing
      the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance.

      Holy shit.    He is going to steal that apple.

      Deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the Vendor
      turns away. Bloom has done it. His pale face tightens.


  

                                                                   87
     
156   CONTINUED:                                                   156


      And turns.

      And sees a five year old boy.      Giving him a stare of infinite
      judgement.

      Bloom turns on his heel and RUNS HELL FOR LEATHER.

      The vendor shouts. The little boy chases him, pointing and
      screaming. Dogs bark. People stare. And Bloom sprints,
      apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.


157   INT. PRAGUE POLICE STATION - EVENING                         157

      Stephen bails Bloom out.

                               STEPHEN
                   An apple?

                             BLOOM
                   Yeah, but it was part of an
                   epiphany.


158   EXT. HUNGARIAN COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT                           158

      The train thunders South, towards Greece.


159   INT. TRAIN SLEEPER CAR - NIGHT                               159

      Stephen pokes his head into Penelope's car, says goodnight.

      As soon as he's gone, a foot dangles down outside the window
      and taps it. Penelope pulls it open, Bloom shimmies in with
      two mini bottles of gin.

      He kisses her.


160   INT. SHIP STATE ROOM - MORNING                               160

      Bloom holds a sleeping Penelope, watching the sun stream
      through the window and slipping the green rubber band cash
      into her suitcase.

      A low horn blows, and Bloom's face darkens.


161   EXT. THE ATLANTIC OCEAN - DAY                                161

      The good ship Fidele breaks the waves, blowing its horn.

 

                                                                 88
   
161   CONTINUED:                                                 161


      Stephen stands on the deck.      Bloom joins him.

                             STEPHEN
                   Mexico.

      He strolls off, leaving Bloom watching the horizon gloomily.


162   EXT. DECK - DAY                                            162

      Our intrepid four sit around a small table (except for the
      Chink, who lies on a deck chair in a bikini and Chuck
      Taylors, sunning herself.)

                             STEPHEN
                   Oh-kay. We're rendezvousing with
                   Senor Rioso's guys here, on an
                   isolated beach just south of the
                   Mexican port town Tampico. A
                   simple handoff. Penelope and
                   Yeungling will stay with the car,
                   Bloom and I will do the handing.

                             PENELOPE
                   You guys seem a little tense.

                             STEPHEN
                   Well I'm not thrilled they set this
                   in Mexico. There could be
                   legitimate reasons, but Mexico's -
                   and I don't want to simplistically
                   vilify an entire country, but
                   Mexico's a horrible place. So
                   we'll be careful.


163   EXT. MEXICO BEACH - LATE AFTERNOON                         163

      The Chink fires an automatic pistol eight times into the dead
      center of a target pinned to a palm tree. She re-loads.


164   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS                    164

      The beach sprawling below them, Penelope and Bloom meander.

      The hotel itself feels very old, red ruinous stone.

                             PENELOPE
                   Is this going to be more dangerous
                   than I think, tomorrow?


 

                                                               89
 
164   CONTINUED:                                               164


                             BLOOM
                   Yeah. You should sleep at the
                   hotel tonight, I'll stay with
                   Stephen at the beach house. You'll
                   need sleep.

      On the distant beach, following the faint rapport of gunfire,
      a palm tree falls over.

                             PENELOPE
                   I'm really happy right now.   Are
                   you?

                             BLOOM
                   Right now I am.

      She kisses him and runs off along the cliff side, singing the
      smuggler song.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Penelope...

      But she's too far away now, and the ocean is too loud. She
      can't hear him, and he can't hear her, and in another moment
      she has vanishes into the green brush and white flowers.

      Behind Bloom's pained face, the sun dips towards the beach.


165   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                  165

      Stephen packs for tomorrow, Bloom stares out the black
      window, drinking. Flower in his lapel.

      Stephen picks up the con flowchart.

                             STEPHEN
                   The last box in our last con. Let
                   them begin the beguine. How's it
                   feel?

                             BLOOM
                   She's something special, Stephen.

                              STEPHEN
                   Uh huh.

                              BLOOM
                   Can I...

      He stares at his drink.


 

                                                                    90

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Can I just have a little more time?
                   Just a few days. I want to keep
                   her, like this, I don't want this
                   to just end. Don't make me do
                   this.

                             STEPHEN
                   Be angry at me, you son of a bitch.
                   Don't be pathetic. Make you?
                   Jesus. I told you not to fall for
                   her-

                             BLOOM
                   I'm not gonna do this.

      Stephen comes very close to Bloom's face, looks him straight
      in the eye. Finds his answer.

                             STEPHEN
                   I don't believe you.

      He goes back to packing.


166   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            166

      Bloom stands, the beach behind him, the glowing lights of the
      hotel before him. Growing determination.


167   EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                    167

      Bloom knocks on a door.       Penelope answers, in her bathrobe.

                                PENELOPE
                   Hey.

                             BLOOM
                   I know what I've gotta do. I've
                   gotta talk to you. Are you wearing
                   shoes?

                                PENELOPE
                   What's up?

      He pulls her out of the room.


168   INT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                            168

      Bloom pulls Penelope by the hand, but she stops.

  

                                                                91

                   Bloom.   What?

      Deep breath.

                             BLOOM
                   My brother and I are con men. All
                   things considered, we might be the
                   most respected con man team working
                   today. And everything since you
                   hit me with your Lamborghini, all
                   of this, it's all fake. It's all a
                   con.


169   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                          169

      The waves break angrily on the beach. In the distance,
      Stephen finishes his drink on the beach house porch, goes
      inside and turns out the light.


170   EXT. TAMPICO HOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHT                          170

                             BLOOM
                   No, we were going to blow you off
                   tomorrow using the cackle bladder,
                   it's a, term, we have actors
                   playing the Argentina guy's men,
                   when we showed up the deal would go
                   bad, they would open fire on us,
                   Stephen and I would pretend to be
                   shot using blood packets, squibs.
                   That's - cackle bladder, in the old
                   days they put fake blood in chicken
                   bladders, so... So you'd escape
                   with the Chink, she'd send you off
                   with a little travelling money and
                   that would be that.

                              PENELOPE
                   Wow.

                             BLOOM
                   But that's not how this one's going
                   to end. I love you now, and I want
                   to get you out of this. I'm going
                   to do what I have to do to get you
                   out of this, away from all this for
                   good. Are you ready?

                                                                   92
     




171   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                           171

      Bloom leads Penelope down the beach by the hand.

                           BLOOM
                 Stephen's gone into town to prep
                 the Argentina actors. Your money's
                 at his place.

                           PENELOPE
                 Money? I don't want the money,
                 let's just leave.

      For a moment he's tempted.      The dark beach house looms ahead.

                              BLOOM
                 C'mon.


172   INT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                     172

      Dark. Bloom leads Penelope in, stumbles in the dark,
      switches on a lamp. Click, click - it doesn't come on.

                           STEPHEN (O.S.)
                 You have to switch it on at the
                 base.

      A beat.   Bloom does.

      Stephen sits in an easy chair, not looking happy.     But not
      angry. Much more sad than angry.

                           BLOOM
                 So I've told her our whole play.
                 And I'm here. To take her money
                 back. How's that make you feel?

                           STEPHEN
                 Disappointed.

                           BLOOM
                 This isn't the ending you wanted?

                           STEPHEN
                 It doesn't matter now. This is the
                 way it ends. So let's get it over
                 with.

                           BLOOM
                 Where's the money?

 

                                                                    93

                               STEPHEN
                   I ate it.

                             BLOOM
                   Give me the money, Stephen.

                               STEPHEN
                   No.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't want the money.

                             BLOOM
                   He's not going to keep a single
                   piece of you.

      Stephen stands.

                             STEPHEN
                   I'm sorry you fell in love with
                   her. But she's a mark. And all of
                   this, all of it is a con. Every
                   moment you shared with her, you
                   were just playing the part of a man
                   falling in love. That's what
                   you're afraid of, right? That you
                   don't know the difference? Or
                   maybe that there is no difference.
                   That that's what love is.

                             PENELOPE
                   We're leaving.

                             STEPHEN
                       (to Bloom)
                   No. You're too scared to leave.
                   You're scared to ride off into a
                   sunset that isn't painted
                   tarpaulin, cause real sunsets are
                   beautiful but they turn into dark
                   uncertain nights. If you were
                   ready for that, you wouldn't be
                   here. The money is in my bedroom.
                   Right behind me. But in my story
                   you don't get the money or the
                   sunset or the girl.

      A long beat.       The dark bedroom doorway looms behind Stephen.

                               PENELOPE
                   Bloom.    Let's just go.   Please.


  

                                                                  94

      Bloom LUNGES, cracking Stephen in the jaw.

      Stephen goes down, Bloom leaps past him - but Stephen grabs
      Bloom's leg and brings him down.

      Then they are fighting.    Penelope watches, horrified.

      A frightening, brutal brawl that tears the small beach house
      apart, thirty years worth of a fight.

      Until Stephen throws Bloom to the ground at Penelope's feet.

      Upsetting a small table. The Chink's pistol, lying on the
      holey paper target, falls and strikes the ground.

      And goes off with a deafening rapport.

      Blood spreads just beneath Stephen's collarbone.

      Penelope screams.

      Stephen stays standing for a moment, shocked. A dribble of
      blood out of the corner of his mouth. He half grins.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil.

      And sinks to the ground.

      Bloom's eyes glaze.    He crawls to his brother.   Takes him in
      his arms.

                             BLOOM
                I'm sorry.

      Penelope watches the brothers holding each other. Tears in
      her eyes, but she backs away a step, very conscious of not
      being a part of this moment.

      Bloom looks up at her, almost taking a moment to recognize
      her.

                             PENELOPE
                Bloom...

      He doesn't move from his brother.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                I'm sorry.

      She leaves.




                                                                 95

      For a long moment the Brothers Bloom lie in each other's arms
      in the middle of the broken room.

      Then Bloom stands, goes to the window and watches Penelope
      walking off into the distance down the beach.

      From the darkened bedroom doorway steps the Chink, her face a
      mask.

      Stephen stands.   Lifts his shirt and removes the squib and
      blood packets.

      Bloom steps outside.


173   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT                                    173

      A wood patio with steps leading down to the sand.   Bloom
      watches Penelope, now very distant, almost gone.

      Stephen comes out, pulls out a flask.

                             STEPHEN
                Hey.
                    (nothing)
                I think that was the most honest
                conversation we've ever had.
                    (more nothing)
                You actually connected on a few of
                those punches.

                          BLOOM
                Did you expect me to do it? To
                come here tonight, end it the way
                you wrote it? Or were you really
                disappointed I didn't run off with
                her?

                           STEPHEN
                I was disappointed.    But I wasn't
                surprised.

      Bloom turns and SLUGS him in the jaw.   Stephen falls to the
      sand.

                          BLOOM
                I let you do your monologue, but
                you wanna know why I did it? I did
                it so she'd never want to see me
                again. To get her away from all
                this for good.


 

                                                               96

      Without looking back Bloom walks off down the beach, in the
      opposite direction of Penelope, leaving Stephen bleeding in
      the sand, alone in the dark uncertain night.

                                                       FADE OUT.

      Penelope's home, bucolic on a lazy Spring day.

      At a picnic table at the far edge of the front lawn, Penelope
      sits writing with intense concentration on a piece of paper.

      After awhile she raises her head, regarding what she's
      written thoughtfully. Folds it up, puts it in her pocket.

      Clicks the seemingly innocent ballpoint pen.

      BEEP.

      The mansion EXPLODES, completely.

      She walks away without looking back.

      After a beat, the plaster deer explodes in a ridiculous
      fireball.


175   EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                             175

      Green hills surround the walled medieval city of Ferentino.
      A tiny white car inches its way across the countryside, and
      up into the city.


176   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - DAY                             176

      Bloom walks up the stone alley to his apartment, a bag of
      groceries in hand. He spots the white car parked out front.

      Loud shouting in Italian grows louder, until Penelope and the
      Grandmother burst out the front door. Berating each other
      with Italian curses and hand gestures.

      Penelope sees Bloom, and freezes.

                            PENELOPE
                   Hello.




                                                                97

                                BLOOM
                   Hey.

      The Grandmother keeps up her barrage as she takes the
      groceries from Bloom, but as soon as she's behind Penelope's
      back she gives Bloom a wink, points to her and gives a thumbs-
      up of approval.


177   EXT. FERENTINO STREETS - DAY                              177

      Bloom and Penelope wander the twisty alleyways of the city.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find me?

                                PENELOPE
                   The Chink.

                             BLOOM
                   How did you find the Chink?

                             PENELOPE
                   She gave me her cell when we got to
                   Mexico.

                             BLOOM
                   I didn't even know she had one.

                             PENELOPE
                   I think she's kind of selective in
                   who she gives the number to.


178   EXT. FERENTINO CAFE - LATER                               178

      They sit with wine and bread.

                   Why are you here, Penelope?

                             PENELOPE
                   Why did you decide to stay with
                   your brother instead of coming with
                   me in Mexico?

                             BLOOM
                   Everything Stephen said that night
                   was true.






                                                                   98

                             PENELOPE
                   I've been doing a lot of thinking
                   the past three months. I want you
                   to consider something.

      She takes a piece of paper from her pocket, unfolds it and
      slides it across the table to him.

      On it, written over and over in a dozen different stylized
      fonts, is "PENELOPE THE CON ARTIST."

      Bloom sets the paper down with a snap.

                             BLOOM
                   Go away. Everything Stephen said
                   was true. I was just playing you
                   as a mark. Everything between us,
                   none of it was real.

      She leans in close to him, her hand on his leg.

                             PENELOPE
                   I don't believe you.

      It's obvious even before she kisses him that she's right.

      Bloom dials a pay phone.    He's been crying.    It rings.

                             BLOOM
                   Pick up... c'mon...


180   INT. MONTE CARLO CASINO - CONTINUOUS                          180

      Lush, Edwardian. In a private room, a card table is
      overturned. Stephen lies on the ground in a defensive
      posture, a RAVISHING WOMAN in red lunging at him with a
      curved dagger. A BEARDED MAN with an eyepatch holds her back
      by the wrists, while a MONOCLED MAN in an antique wheelchair
      holds his tear stained face in his hands.

      This whole scene is frozen like a tableau, as Stephen's cell
      phone chirps away.

      Annoyed, the Bearded Man gives him a `go ahead' nod.

      Stephen hastily answers it.



   

                                                                99

                             STEPHEN (ON PHONE)
                   Uh... Nine-ish?

      Bloom fishes out his pocket watch.

                              BLOOM
                   Alright.

      Click. As he's putting his pocket watch back, he finds the
      stack of green rubber band money in his breast pocket.

      Penelope plays cards with the Grandmother.


183   EXT. FERENTINO APARTMENT - NIGHT                           183

      Stephen and Bloom sit on the little landing outside the
      apartment.

                             STEPHEN
                   So she comes back wanting to work
                   with us. Honestly? I think we'd
                   be lucky to have her. If you
                   called me to hear my opinion on the
                   matter. Which I'm getting the
                   feeling you didn't.

                             BLOOM
                   I did what I did in Mexico to get
                   her out of all this. I would rather
                   die than bring her into the con.

                             STEPHEN
                   So maybe you want to tell me what
                   I'm doing in Ferentino.






                                                                 100

                   You knew she'd come back. What did
                   you figure she was good for,
                   another million?

                             STEPHEN
                   One point seven five.

                             BLOOM
                   We will play her again, one last
                   con, but not for money. I'm gonna
                   tell you how this one's gonna end.
                   You built us into this, you're
                   gonna fly us out, end it so she's
                   done with all of us. End it all so
                   it can't start up again.

                             STEPHEN
                   You want me to plan a con whose
                   sole purpose is to blow her off for
                   good?

                             BLOOM
                   I love her. You owe me this. I
                   don't want to turn her into me.

      Penelope sleeps on a cot against the window.

      Bloom enters wearily.    Sits in a chair.   Watches her.

      In the next room over, Stephen sits in the dark.    Shuffling
      cards.

      A lovely tune sung in Mandarin Chinese plays over this,
      segueing us into...

      On a television screen, images of the Shanghai skyline.

      TITLE CARD - Shanghai

      A wall of monitors, which the Chink steps in front of,
      singing the climax of the song. Beautiful and sad.

      As the song ends, she sees through the spotlight Penelope,
      Bloom and Stephen at a table. Penelope waves.


 

                                                               101

      The Chink's face betrays just the slightest hint of
      disappointment.

                   So what's the next job?

                             STEPHEN
                   Before we do the next job, we need
                   to liquidate our assets from the
                   last job.

                             PENELOPE
                   But you've got-

                             STEPHEN
                   Your money from the last job, well
                   that's profit, not capital, the
                   three of us have already split it
                   up. So step one: sell the book of
                   hours.

                             PENELOPE
                   I thought it was fake.

                             STEPHEN
                   With all your random expertise we
                   couldn't risk a flat out fake. It
                   isn't worth two point five million,
                   we could maybe catch four hundred
                   grand for it, but it's real. Who'd
                   we buy it from?

                              BLOOM
                   Minskie.

                             STEPHEN
                   Perfect, we'll sell it right back
                   to him.

      The Chink hands him a piece of paper.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   If he wasn't dead.

                             BLOOM
                   Well there's Demarco or Boyer. Or
                   Roche, if we want to go state-side.



                                                                  102

                   All traceable. With Minskie out
                   we'd have to go deep black market
                   if we wanted to be a hundred
                   percent clear. There's only one
                   place that's deep enough for that.

      Bloom and the Chink know exactly what he's talking about, and
      they don't look happy.

                              PENELOPE
                   Where?

                   Russia. It's like `cancer', I
                   don't even like saying the word.

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink drink in a cramped little
      concrete room adjacent to the bar's kitchen.

                             STEPHEN
                   We're obviously not going to deal
                   with real Russians. They'll be our
                   guys in a phony set up, they'll
                   take our phony book and give her
                   phony cash, a closed loop. Safe
                   and simple.

      Bloom looks to the Chink for an opinion.      Gets a blank face.

                              STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So.   We go to St. Petersburg.

      At the mention of St. Petersburg Bloom looks sharply at
      Stephen, but Stephen presses on.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   She does the hand-off with our fake
                   "Russians." But while we're
                   driving out of town, everything
                   goes bad.

      He lays a simple flowchart, drawn on a napkin - three boxes.
      He points to the first, "Penelope sells book to `Russians'"

                   We discover we were sold a
                   counterfeit book in the first
                   place, which we've now sold to
                   Russian smugglers. We discover
                   this when the Russian mob starts
                   taking us out one by one. Oh shit.

      He points to the second box, "Red Dawn."

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   First they ambush our car,
                   destroying the money. Then they
                   take me out, then the Chink, and
                   finally you Bloom, in a heroic
                   death that allows Penelope to
                   barely escape with her life.
                   Devastated but reborn with the
                   knowledge that you loved her so
                   much you died so she could live,
                   she drives off into a romantic life
                   of adventure and peril, on the run
                   from imaginary Russians.

      He points to the third box, "The End."

      Empty. The Dog leans against the bar with several LACKEYS,
      waiting patiently, making sparks with his gold lighter.
      Sounds of shouting come from the adjoining dining area.

                   understand. Three months ago you
                   were ready to blind the old bastard-

                   We need someone who can pass for
                   the Russian mob to buy our fake
                   book. The Dog's got his big store
                   right here in St. Petersburg.

                             BLOOM
                   Alright, fuckin stop. You want
                   this to finish in St. Petersburg,
                   you want this to end with the Dog
                   for some what thematic something?
                   Fine but don't tell it like a
                   story, let's say it. Twenty three
                   years ago and I can still smell,
                   that blood red apartment of his,
                   the smell of that place. I hate
                   him Stephen but this isn't that,
                   this is I don't trust him.

                   him. Trust me. It's gonna be ok.


193   INT. HOTEL BAR - LATER                                       193

      The red leather suitcase on the bar.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Stephen, still the grand architect
                   with your symbols. Red for
                   temptation, white for salvation.

      The Dog opens it, revealing US hundreds.      Examines it with a
      loupe.

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   Impressive, boys.

                             BLOOM
                   It's trash. There's visible cross
                   hatching in Franklin's eye.

      Sure enough - obvious jagged misprints cut into Ben
      Franklin's eye on the bills.

                             DIAMOND DOG
                   Hm.  I'll be damned.
                       (closes case)
                   Ruskies wouldn't be caught dead
                   handing over a rag bag like this,
                   it should be a steel attache.

                               STEPHEN
                   This'll   do. We'll do the drop off
                   at your   store. Make it scary,
                   think a   movie version of the
                   Russian   mafia, but don't hassle
                   her.

                               DIAMOND DOG
                   Alright.

      The Dog closes the case, and for a moment Bloom's eyes rest
      on his bandaged hand.

      He then takes the case and quickly moves off with his crew.

 

                                                                  106

                             DIAMOND DOG (cont'd)
                   I look forward to meeting the lady.
                   Take care, boys.

      Leaving his gold lighter on the bar.


194   INT. HOTEL CAR PORT - NIGHT                                  194

      The Chink leads Stephen and Bloom around the brown Peugeot.

                             STEPHEN
                   So. Our fake Russian attack. One
                   small charge will simulate a bullet
                   hit, and blow out the back window.

      The Chink points with an extendable pointer to a small nub on
      the rear windshield.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   So that one bang, then we roll off
                   the road. Once we get clear of the
                   car the Chink sets off the final
                   charge, incinerating the car and
                   the money in the trunk. This'll
                   all happen exactly twenty seconds
                   after we cross the main bridge out
                   of town. After the bridge.

      Stephen makes a note in a manila envelope, tucks it in his
      jacket.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.


195   INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER                                   195

      Bloom and the Chink walk back to their rooms.      The Chink is
      expressionless.

                             BLOOM
                   You've been awful quiet.

      She doesn't react.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   I'm doing this for her.

      But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall.

                                                                   107
      




196   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM                                    196

      Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily
      looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway.

                          PENELOPE
                Tomorrow it all starts.

      She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts
      into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her
      for the last time.

      When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready.


197   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE                                 197

      The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city.


198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198

      Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a
      doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars.

      Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch.

                          BLOOM
                She gives the Dog the book, he
                gives her the fake money. This is
                taking too long.

      Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand.


199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199

      On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake.
      Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood.

                          PENELOPE
                He hassled me. Took forever
                looking the book over, haggled the
                price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles.

      Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there.

                           STEPHEN
                Alright.   Let's get the hell out of
                Russia.


  

                                                                 108
    
199   CONTINUED:                                                  199


      Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one
      last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the
      lake.


200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200

      The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun.


201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201

      The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun.

      Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary.

      He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead.

      She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair.
      He breathes, closes his eyes.

      An explosion shatters the front passenger window.

      Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright.

      The bridge is still a quarter mile away.

      In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass,
      screams, tires screeching.


202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202

      A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire
      blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot.

      The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment
      full speed, launching into the air.


203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203

      A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The
      brothers lock eyes for a split second.


204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204

      The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to
      flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an
      abrupt stop against a stout tree.




                                                                   109
      
204   CONTINUED:                                                    204


                             STEPHEN
                   OUT!

      They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope,
      tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car
      becomes a roiling ball of flame.

      Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees
      Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of
      the car.

      A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a
      flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches
      down to him...

      Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness.


205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205

      Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree.
      Penelope hunches over him.

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Are you alright?

                             BLOOM
                   What happened?

                             PENELOPE
                   Yeungling went to get another car.

                             BLOOM
                   Where's Stephen?

                             PENELOPE
                   We don't know. He was gone.

      Bloom stands shakily, goes to the charred car.      Runs his
      fingers over the dozens of bullet holes.

      Goes to where Stephen fell.       Lying in the grass, a manila
      envelope.

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   We're going to find him. If he
                   escaped, he'll contact us. If
                   they've got him, it's for ransom.


  

                                                                110

                   Who's got him?

                             PENELOPE
                   The Russians.

      The Chink pulls up in the green bug, headlights catching
      Bloom's face against the dark forest depths.


206   EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY                                     206

      A desolate gas station parking lot. Bloom sits in the Bug,
      loading his revolver with shaky fingers. Penelope stands
      outside.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, god please what's
                   happening. I don't know what to
                   do. I don't know Stephen please.
                   Please. What's happening. Please.

      A long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot
      outside the window, Bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready.

      But the Chink climbs out of the black sedan.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where does she get all these cars?

      Bloom motions for Penelope to stay back, then goes to meet
      the Chink in the middle of the parking lot.

                             BLOOM
                   If you know what's happening, now
                   would be a really good time to
                   speak up.

      She sets a suitcase down beside her.    Bloom takes this in.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No, please. Not now. I need your
                   help here now, I don't know what to
                   do.

      The slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the
      world. But she's leaving.

      She hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching
      for an instant.



 

                                                                    111

      She gives Penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up
      her case and walks off.

      A truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets
      in.

      Bloom looks down at the slip of paper.        A short phrase, in
      Chinese.

                               BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Thanks.

      The engine turns over, and the Chink's car EXPLODES in a
      dramatic fireball.

      The paper flutters out of Blooms's fingers a moment before he
      and Penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave.

      Bloom and Penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just
      happened.


207   EXT. CHICAGO - DAY                                             207

      A busy street, which a title card identifies as "Chicago,
      Illinois."

      On the corner, an unassuming Chinese restaurant.


208   INT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY                                  208

      A dive.   The chef on the phone.

                             CHEF
                   Ah, ah yes, Mr. Bloom.      Yes, ok.

                               ALL THE COOKS
                   Blooooom!

      He puts the phone down and goes to the fax machine, which is
      spitting out a facsimile of the Chink's slip of paper.


209   INT. ST. PETERSBURG COPY SHOP - EARLY MORNING                  209

      Bloom on a pay phone, scribbling on a piece of paper.




   

                                                               112

                             BLOOM
                   Uh huh. Assholes. Ok. Um, ok.
                   So I've got "We are all assholes in
                   our own theatrical enterprises."
                   You sure?

      This phrase, written on Bloom's paper.

                             CHEF
                   And then it end with "Goodbye shit
                   head."

                                BLOOM
                   Shit head?

                             CHEF
                   But it is different meaning in
                   Mandarin, uh, endearing. "Shit
                   head" if you have affection for
                   shit.


210   EXT. SIDEWALK - MOMENTS LATER                             210

      The Bug parked nearby. Penelope sits on the curb, crying.
      Bloom sits next to her.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it mean?

                             BLOOM
                   I don't know.

                             PENELOPE
                   What did it say?

                             BLOOM
                   "We're all of us marks in our own
                   cons." And she said goodbye.

                             PENELOPE
                   I still can't believe it.

                             BLOOM
                   That the Chink fell for a car bomb?
                   Neither can I.

                             PENELOPE
                       (hopeful)
                   What? Oh, oh god do you think she
                   faked it? So the Russians would
                   think she was dead?



                                                                   113

      Bloom stands, paces away. He leafs limply through the manila
      folder - addresses, pictures, information...

      A paper with the Dog's photo clipped to it.       An address in
      St. Petersburg.

      The napkin Stephen wrote the con flowchart on.      The third box
      - "The End."

                             PENELOPE (cont'd)
                   What do we do now?

      Scrawled on the inside of the manila envelope - "An unwritten
      life." Bloom's face clears. He wipes his eyes.

                             BLOOM
                   Ok.

      Bloom goes to the Bug.

                             PENELOPE
                   Where are you going?

                             BLOOM
                   This wasn't Russians. This was
                   done by an old mentor of ours who
                   wants us off the map. He has an
                   apartment in St. Petersburg. So
                   this is, yeah. I've gotta go back
                   to that apartment to face the Dog
                   and get my brother back. That's
                   how I'm gonna end this.

      Penelope's eyes gleam. She jumps up to the passenger door,
      and Bloom stops her with a weary look.

                             PENELOPE
                   We can skip the whole you-sending-
                   me-nobly-away-and-me-refusing-to-
                   leave-your-side-thing.

                             BLOOM
                   Thank Christ.


211   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - LATE MORNING                     211

      A narrow alley between tall apartments.    Bloom parks, pulls
      his gun and checks it.




  

                                                                     114

                             BLOOM
                   If there are shots you run to the
                   car and drive, with or without me.


212   INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - DAY                                   212

      A badly lit apartment hallway.       Bloom approaches a door,
      Penelope behind him.

      His breathing becomes hard.        His face contorts.   He crumples
      next to the door.

                             PENELOPE
                   What's in there? Tell me who this
                   guy is.

      Bloom's breathing steadies.

                             BLOOM
                   He's just an old man.

      He tries the knob.     It opens.


213   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - D                                213

      Blood red walls.

      Dark, neglected and to all appearances empty.       Bloom creeps
      down the darkened corridor, gun outstretched.       Breathes
      through his nose, chokes.

                              BLOOM
                   Dog!   I came back.

      He kicks open a door, revealing a large living space.         Empty.

      He lowers his gun, switches on the light.

      Penelope enters.     Sniffs the air.

                             PENELOPE
                   Moth balls.

      Bloom almost laughs.

                             BLOOM
                   Is that what that smell is?

      BAM! A closet door smacks open, revealing the business end
      of a double barrel shotgun.

    

                                                                   115

      Bloom spins, gun drawn.      Penelope screams.

      Then a moment of stillness.       The shotgun barrel quivers.

      It's held by the 11 year old boy Bloom saw in the Dog's
      Mercedes in Prague. Malnourished and scared.

      Penelope approaches him slowly.

                             PENELOPE
                       (in Russian)
                   It's okay. Honey, it's alright.

      The shotgun sinks to the ground.      Penelope strokes his hair
      back from his face.

      Bloom lowers the gun, trembling.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him if anyone else is here.

      She does.

                             BOY
                   Nyet.

                             BLOOM
                   Ask him where the Diamond Dog is.

                             PENELOPE
                   Diamond Dog?
                       (in Russian)
                   Where is the Diamond Dog?

                             BOY
                       (in English)
                   The Dog of Diamonds is gone.

      Bloom does a quick search of the rest of the room. As he
      does Penelope asks the boy one more question in Russian, and
      gets a quick answer.

                             BLOOM
                   Get the car started.

                             PENELOPE
                   What about him?

                             BLOOM
                   It's alright.



  

                                                               116

      She believes him, and goes.   Bloom kneels in front of the
      boy.

                          BLOOM (cont'd)
                You don't need to be afraid of him
                anymore. Or angry at him. Or ever
                come back here again. He doesn't
                concern you anymore. Understand?
                It's gonna be ok.

      The boy nods. Bloom hands him the stack of bills wrapped in
      the green rubber band. The boy snatches it and runs off.


214   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG STREET - DAY                             214

      Bloom trots out of the apartment building, and sees two
      things: Penelope working the VW's starter, and a black
      Mercedes speeding down the narrow street towards her.

      He sprints towards her, screaming

                           BLOOM
                Get out!   Get out of the car!!

      She sees the approaching Merc, too late, and ducks down.

      A hand hurls something from the darkened window. It smashes
      through the Bug's passenger side window, showering Penelope
      with glass.

      The Mercedes roars off down the street.

      Bloom reaches the Bug and throws the door open.

      Penelope lies covered in safety glass, holding a Russian
      nesting doll.


215   INT. BUG - LATER                                             215

      The seven progressively smaller dolls lie open on the back
      seat, Bloom holds the two halves of the final tiny doll, and
      Penelope holds a note.

                          PENELOPE
                It's a ransom note. It says they
                have Stephen, it says they want the
                money wired to a specific account,
                they give a bank to do it at and a
                manager to ask for.

                   p.m. In two hours.

                             BLOOM
                   I'll wire the money from my
                   account, and we'll go get Stephen.

                             PENELOPE
                   It's a lot.

                               BLOOM
                   How much?

                             PENELOPE
                   I'll do it, I want to, I've got

                             BLOOM
                   How much are they asking for?

                             PENELOPE
                   One point seven five million.

      A cold pit opens in Bloom's stomach.

                              BLOOM
                   Oh.   Oh oh. No no NO.

      He punches the dashboard.

                             BLOOM (cont'd)
                   No I'll kill him. I'll kill him if
                   that's what this is, if that's all
                   that this is, no NO NO.

                   What are you talking about?

                             BLOOM
                   There's another possibility that I
                   should of, I'm a fucking idiot.
                   This might all be a con. By my
                   brother. To get me - oh god - he
                   wanted me to face the Dog, to end
                   it, and he gets your money. Oh
                   god. I'm going to be sick.

                          PENELOPE

                Son of a bitch.

216   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG BANK - DAY                              216

      Bloom sits in the car, alone. He punches the dashboard
      again, helpless enraged and scared.

      Penelope gets in, looks at the address on the note.

                          PENELOPE
                Ok.


217   EXT. BURNED OUT THEATER - DAY                               217

      Penelope and Bloom sit in the car, parked in front of the
      impressive facade of a closed, burned out old theater.

      The clock on the dashboard reads 1:50.

                           BLOOM
                I'm so scared. Anything I can
                imagine finding in there, I'm
                scared of.

                          PENELOPE
                I'm going to be here when you come
                out.

      She kisses him.

      He puts his hand on the door.    Hesitates.   Then goes.

      Walks up the stairs to the inky maw of the theater door.
      Goes in alone.

                                                               119
  




218   INT. THEATER LOBBY                                            218

      No lights. Moldy dust. A genuinely creepy place.      Bloom
      steps lightly, deeper into the theater.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!


219   INT. THEATER AUDITORIUM                                       219

      A few lights flicker on the walls, fitfully illuminating the
      broken dusty seats and bare ruined stage.

      Bloom walks down the aisle, trying to keep his voice steady.

                           BLOOM
                Stephen!

      A spotlight snaps on from the mezzanine, right in Bloom's
      face. He spins, trapped in its glare.

      A guttural command is shouted in what might be Russian.

      When Bloom doesn't respond, the spot silently advances a few
      feet ahead of him towards the stage.

      Bloom gingerly follows it, up onto the splintered stage and
      finally resting on a split in the tarpaulin backdrop.

      With a wary glance back, Bloom steps through it.


220   INT. THEATER BACKSTAGE                                        220

      Giant fossils of antique stage scenery. Utility lights high
      above, cut by scaffolding, patch everything in dim jagged
      forms of light and black.

                          BLOOM
                    (unsteady)
                Stephen. Game's up. Come on out.
                Let's blow this one hat town.

      Silence. Then a harsh utility lamp snaps on, cruelly
      lighting Stephen's face.

      Shockingly bruised and battered, old and new blood.

      Bloom cries and rushes towards him...




                                                                120

                   No!   No Bloom, freeze.

      He obeys. Stephen is tied to a chair. A dark figure behind
      him holds the lamp with a black gloved hand.

                             BLOOM
                   Stephen, who is it?   Is it the Dog?

                             STEPHEN
                   Did Penelope wire the money?

                              BLOOM
                   Yeah.

                             STEPHEN
                   They're calling to check right now.
                   Don't move. I'm alright.

      The dark figure's cell phone rings, he holds it to his ear
      for a moment then flips it closed.

      Something happens in the blackness, and Stephen shakily
      stands, cut loose.

                             STEPHEN (cont'd)
                   Stay where you are, Bloom. I'm
                   coming to you.

      He takes a couple wobbly steps.

      Behind him, Bloom sees the dark figure raising his gun
      towards Stephen's back, pulling the hammer...

      And the utility lamp switches off.

                              BLOOM
                   No!

      Bloom's revolver pops out of his sleeve and he's firing into
      the blackness.

      Stephen drops flat to the ground.

      The fiery rapport of a big pistol flashes from the blackness,
      strobing the scene like stage lightning.

      Bloom reloads behind the cover of a heavy flat, but Stephen
      lies on his stomach out in the open.

                              BLOOM (cont'd)
                   Stephen!



                                                                 121

                              STEPHEN
                 Stay back!

      But Bloom makes a dash for his brother, out into the open,
      unloading three more rounds into the dark.

      The dark figure returns fire on Bloom, who is sprinting full
      on his feet in a large pool of light. A sitting duck.

      Stephen launches himself up, tackling Bloom backwards.

      Just before they fall behind the safety of the flat, a red
      burst of blood flowers from Stephen's left lower back.

      Bloom sets him down gently, and hears heavy footsteps behind
      him.

      He turns, firing, but only sees a blur of dark coat go by,
      through the torn backdrop.

      Bloom runs out on stage, tearing the tarpaulin, and fires
      after the dark figure limping up the aisle and away into the
      lobby.

      Silence.

      Bloom walks back to Stephen, who lies behind the flat,
      breathing heavy. Blood soaking through his shirt.

                           BLOOM
                 Please tell me this is all gonna be
                 ok. Tell me that's a squib, and
                 that's makeup, and that you just
                 gave me what I always wanted and
                 pulled off the perfect con.

      A long, long moment.

      Stephen coughs, spits.     Then a wry grin spreads across his
      face.

                           STEPHEN
                 You said it, not me.

      He stands, the shakiness gone.

                           STEPHEN (cont'd)
                 Can I get a `wow' for this one?

                           BLOOM
                 You son of a bitch.




                                                               122

      Bloom looks like he might hit him, but his face breaks and he
      embraces him, crying. The Brothers Bloom stay like that for
      a long while, holding each other in the spotlight's glow.

      Finally Stephen pulls away, tears in his eyes.   He wipes
      them, wipes blood from his lip.

                          STEPHEN
                Tastes like tin foil. Alright
                here's what I want you to do. The
                Chink split?

                           BLOOM
                Yeah.   Clean exit.

                            STEPHEN
                How?

                            BLOOM
                Car bomb.

      A hint of relief in Stephen's face.

                          STEPHEN
                Good. Here's what. Take Penelope
                back to Helsinki, take that flight
                to Rio. Lay low like we said.
                Play out the on-the-run-from-
                vengeful-Russians thing, that'll be
                fun for her. Play it like I'm
                dead, actually - that'll add some
                gravity to everything, that'll be
                nice. And I'll see you when I see
                you.

                            BLOOM
                Soon?

                          STEPHEN
                I hope not. Last thing you need is
                me hanging around. Anyway, how
                could I top this?

      Bloom hugs him again.

                          BLOOM
                I love you. Bye.

      He turns to go.

                            STEPHEN
                Hey.    Think of any card.



                                                               123

      Stephen pulls out a pack of cards.

                              BLOOM
                 Alright.

      Stephen cuts, to the Queen of hearts.

                           BLOOM (cont'd)
                 Stephen. That's it.
                     (grins)
                 That's the best card trick I've
                 ever seen. I just wish you had a
                 bigger audience.

                           STEPHEN
                 You're the only audience I've ever
                 needed.

      Wink.   Bloom leaves.

      Stephen watches him go.


221   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - LATE AFTERNOON                      221

      Rumbling towards Finland.

      In the Bug, Bloom sleeps in Penelope's arm while she drives.

      She looks at his hand on hers, his shirt cuff bright red with
      Stephen's "blood." She strokes his shoulder sadly.

      Off Bloom's sleeping face...


222   INT. THEATER STAGE                                        222

      Stephen pulls a chair out onto the stage, sets it right in
      the spotlight's glare.

      Trembling as if it takes all his last strength in the world.

      Sits.   Looks at the Queen of Hearts, moves his fingers over
      it.

      Then slides is up his sleeve.

      Blood trickles down his hand.

                                                                  124
     




223   INT. BUG - SUNSET                                            223

      Bloom wakes with a start.

                            PENELOPE
                  Hey. Hey, it's ok. The bridge is
                  coming up, we're almost at the
                  border. Were you dreaming about
                  Stephen?

      She strokes his hair back from his face.

      He nods, and looks down at his sleeve.

      Stephen's "blood" on his white cuff.

      Now a dark shade of brown.

      Bloom looks at this shirt.      All the blood, it's all brown.

      He looks up at the road, nearly panicked.

      Maybe a quarter mile ahead is the bridge.

                               BLOOM
                  Pull over.     Pull over!!


224   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       224

      She does.

      He bursts out of the car, and run/tumbles down the grassy
      hillside till he finds the car tracks.

      He follows them to the charred remains of the Peugeot.

      Penelope stumbles down after him.

                            PENELOPE
                  What is it? You're scaring me-

                            BLOOM
                  What did you ask the Russian kid,
                  in the Dog's apartment? He said
                  the Dog isn't here, then what did
                  you ask?

      Bloom kicks open the trunk.      Pries open the blistered attache
      case.


 

                                                                125

      Sifts through the charred pile of cinders that was the money
      from the "Russians" till he finds what he was looking for and
      brings it out into the dying light.

                             PENELOPE
                   How long had he been alone.

                             BLOOM
                   And what did he say?

      A scrap of unburned money.    A fragment of Ben Franklin's
      face.

                             PENELOPE
                   Since yesterday morning.

      A single eye gazing up at him, the green grass behind it.

      The eye is perfect.    No cross hatching.

      Bloom sinks to his knees.

                             BLOOM
                   This is real. They hassled you.

                             PENELOPE
                   Bloom-

                             BLOOM
                   The Dog was gone before we got
                   there. They hadn't cleared out of
                   their apartment, they had been
                   cleared out.


225   INT. DIAMOND DOG'S APARTMENT - DAY FLASHBACK                 225

      RUSSIANS in black overcoats burst in, shooting the Dog's men
      with silenced pistols.

      The BOY shuts himself in the closet, terrified.


226   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                       226

                             BLOOM
                   Real Russians. Took his store.
                   They didn't know about his deal
                   with us, but you haggled with them.
                   You really sold the book to real
                   Russians. The Diamond Dog was
                   gone.

                                                              126
 




227   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - FLASHBACK                             227

      The scene beside the lake, our four heroes checking the money
      in the attache case.

                          STEPHEN
                Let's get the hell out of Russia.

      Bloom tosses the gold lighter, it splashes into the lake.    We
      follow it, plunging beneath the surface.

      Deep deep down, among weak tendrils of light, the Diamond Dog
      sinks into watery blackness, a long blade in his neck.


228   EXT. ROADSIDE - SUNSET                                      228

                           BLOOM
                And they came after us.   And
                Stephen...

      Penelope holds him tight.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                          BLOOM
                Stephen saved my life.

                             PENELOPE
                I know.

                             BLOOM
                He's gone.

      Bloom folds into Penelope's arms, but she doesn't let him.
      She holds his crying face up.

                          PENELOPE
                And he did it so you could live.
                Your brother loved you. He loved
                you so much. Look at me. Stephen
                said something once, I got the
                feeling he'd rather be telling it
                to you. He said there's no such
                thing as an unwritten life. Just
                badly written ones. I love you.

                   We're gonna outrun these bastard
                   Russian mafia, and we're gonna hide
                   out in Rio, then we're gonna live
                   like we're telling the best fucking
                   story in the world. Are you ready?

      She holds his face close to hers for a long beat. Then
      smiles and pushes away, launching up the grassy hill.

      Bloom watches her.

      Time slows as she turns back towards him, still running, and
      holds out her hand for him to follow.

                             BLOOM (V.O.)
                   I was thinking of something Stephen
                   said too. "The perfect con is one
                   where everyone involved gets just
                   the thing they wanted." Well.

      He takes the girl's hand, and runs with her towards the point
      of light breaking over the hill.


229   EXT. HIGHWAY - SUNSET                                      229

      Sunset with her wine-red fingers falls over the road ahead.
      The rumbly old VW chugs away from us, towards the horizon.



                                THE END
