          HIBERNATING GROUNDHOGS
          A family of groundhogs is nestled together in their burrow
          sleeping off the end of a long winter.

          EXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING

          The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground,
          and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the
          early morning light.

          INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

          PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall
          gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall,
          talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he
          points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME

          CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape,
          flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad
          lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross
          the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest.

          INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME

          Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but
          from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out
          of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's
          pointing to -- a national weather map.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME

          The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets
          heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the
          confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio.

          We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING

          We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks
          volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers
          from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed
          memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award
          statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk
          on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface.
          As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small
          sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline
          blanket.
          GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his
          head in the door.

           HAWLEY
           Christ, what a pit. Phil"
          The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley.
          It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman.

           PHIL

           (SLEEPY)
           What?

           HAWLEY
           It's February first, Phil. You
           know what tomorrow is?
          Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart,
          rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but
          clearly a guy with a lot of personality.

           PHIL
           (catching on)
           Oh, no! Not again.
          He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him.

           PHIL
           Forget it! I'm not going.

          

          INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS

          Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9
          Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local
          news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as
          WPGH - Pittsburgh.
          Phil ducks into the studio.

          

           -3-

          

          

          INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

          Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather
          corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather
          stats up on a chart.

           PHIL
           Get away from me. I'm working.

           HAWLEY
           So what's the outlook? We gonna
           get that blizzard?
          Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed
          "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next
          to the title.

           PHIL
           No way. All that moisture coming
           up from the Gulf is going to miss
           us completely and take a dump on
           Harrisburg.

           HAWLEY
           (with authority)
           Good, 'cause you're going up to
           Punxsutawney to cover the
           groundhog story tomorrow morning
           and I want you back here in time
           to do the five.

           PHIL
           Jesus, Gil, give me a break, will
           you! I covered the goddamn
           groundhog last year and the year
           before that.

           HAWLEY
           And you'll do it :next year and
           the year after, too. When I
           worked in San Diego, I covered
           the swallows coming back to
           Capistrano for ten years in a
           row.

           PHIL
           You should've killed the guy who
           made you do that.

           HAWLEY
           I wanted to do it.

           PHIL
           Then you should've killed
           yourself. I don't want to get
           stuck with the groundhog for the
           rest of my life.

          

           -4-

          

           HAWLEY
           It's a cute story. He comes out,
           he looks around, he wrinkles up
           his little nose, he sniffs around
           a little, he sees his shadow, he
           d oesn't see his shadow-- it's
           nice. People like it.

           PHIL
           Many people are morons.

           HAWLEY
           Just do it.

           PHIL
           What'11 you give me?
          Hawley looks across the studio and sees RITA HANSON enter, a
          very attractive segment producer in her late twenties.

           HAWLEY
           (to Phil)
           I'll give you Rita.
           (calls her over)
           Rita, could you come here for a
           second? I got a little job for
           you.
          Rita is relatively new to the station, but very competent,
          personable, humorous, self-assured and very pretty-- in short,
          a genuine princess, though Phil is too self-absorbed at this
          point to realize it.

           PHIL

           (TEASING)
           You can't send Rita out on a
           story like this. She's just a
           cub, a pup, still wet behind the
           ears. Look at her. Her ears are
           sopping wet. This needs a
           Woodward or a Bernstein. It's a
           big story. People need to know.

           RITA

           (INTRIGUED)
           What's the story?

           HAWLEY
           The Punxsutawney Groundhog
           Festival.

           RITA
           Gil, if it's all right with you
           I ' d rather follow-up on the
           nurses' strike.

          

           -5-

          

           HAWLEY
           You can do the nurses when you
           get back. Just take the squeaky
           wheel here up to Punxsutawney and
           get him back in one piece. Okay?

           RITA
           Yeah, okay.
          Hawley exits leaving Phil and Rita alone in the studio. She
          knows Phil mainly by his reputation and it isn't good. Still,
          she finds him appealing in an odd way.

           PHIL

           (PLEASANTLY)
           You know, this could be extremely
           interesting.

           RITA
           I've never done a weather story
           before. What's Punxsutawney
           like?

           PHIL
           Oh, it's an enchanted place. A
           magical world. It's the
           Constantinople of the whole
           Western Appalachian-Susquehanna
           Drainage system.

           RITA
           Do you always joke?

           PHIL
           About 70 to 80% of the time.
           Inside I'm actually a very shy
           and sensitive person.

           RITA
           A lot of people around here think
           you're not very sincere.

           PHIL
           Tell me the names of these
           people.

           RITA
           I'll line up a crew and
           transportation. If you don't
           feel like driving, we can all go
           up in the van together.

           PHIL
           I think I'll take my own car.
           I ' m not that fond of my fellow
           man.

          

           -6-

          

          

           RITA

           (EXITING)
           Nice attitude.

           PHIL
           Nice face.
           (calls after her)
           Why don't you ride up with me?

           RITA
           No, thanks.
          STEPHANIE DECASTRO , an attractive, dark-eyed, dark-haired
          correspondent, glares at Phil from across the studio.

          

          INT. PHIL'S OFFICE - LATER

          Phil is in his cluttered cubicle talking on a headset phone
          while he reviews cassettes of his groundhog spots from the past
          two years on a small monitor. As he talks, he stuffs a number
          of personal items in an overnight bag, all the time watching
          himself on the TV monitor.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           They don't really think of me as
           a weatherman around here. More
           of a "personality," but with the
           credibility of a first-class
           broadcast journalist. Once you
           look at my tape I think you'll
           see what they mean.
          Stephanie enters and stands in the doorway looking at Phil for
          a long moment. There is something vaguely off-center about
          this woman, not quite FATAL ATTRACTION but still a little
          scary.

           STEPHANIE

           (BITTERLY)
           I just want to know one thing:
           did I do something wrong or are
           you just tired of me or what? I
           have to know.
          Phil sighs.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           Dan, can I call you back? I've
           just been handed something and I
           better get on it...
           (he picks up some
           papers and rustles
           them for effect)
           ...Okay, thanks.

          

           -7-

          
          He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for
          privacy.

           PHIL

           (KINDLY)
           You didn't do anything wrong,
           Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of
           you. It's just that I don't have
           time for a real relationship
           right now. I told you that the
           first time we went out.

           STEPHANIE
           (getting close)
           Everybody says that at the
           beginning of a relationship.

           PHIL
           (gently pushing her

           AWAY)
           I'm different. I really meant
           it! Things are really starting
           to move for me now. I ' m not
           going to be doing the weather for
           the rest of my life. I was just
           talking to the CBS guy about a
           network job. I want that. This
           is just the beginning for me. I
           can't waste any more time.

           STEPHANIE
           Are you saying our relationship
           was a waste of time?

           PHIL
           Our relationship? We went out a
           total of four times! And only
           twice did anything happen. It
           was fun but I don't see that as
           a big commitment.

           STEPHANIE
           (closing in again)
           I had our charts done. My
           astrologer says we're extremely
           compatible. There may even be
           some past lives involvement here.

           PHIL
           See? So we've already done this.
           Let's move on. Next case.

           STEPHANIE
           You know what's wrong with you,
           Phil? You're selfish. You don't
           have time for anyone but
           yourself.

          

           -8-

          

           PHIL
           That's what I ' m trying to tell
           you. You don't want to be with
           me. You can do better. Look,
           Stephanie, if I ever said or did
           anything to mislead you I'm sorry
           for that, but right now I have to
           do this groundhog thing and I
           don't have a handle on it yet.
          He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and
          puts on his jacket.

           PHIL (CONT.)
           I'll tell you what. I ' m going to
           do some serious thinking while
           I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay?
          He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her
          standing there with a malevolent look on her face.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

          A VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane
          highway through the winter landscape of West Central
          Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter.
          Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and
          techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus
          coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen
          Like it Wet."

           PHIL (V.O.)
           (on his earphone)
           I'm on my way to Punxsutawney...
           (forced to repeat it,
           a little embarrassed)
           Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun?
           I think that all depends on you.

          

          INT. THE LEXUS - CONTINUOUS

          Phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a
          stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both
          hands.

           PHIL
           . . . . I thought maybe you could
           meet me up there tonight and let
           me vulgarize you for about seven
           hours....So I ' m supposed to spend
           the night in Punxsutawney all
           alo ne? Thanks.

          
          Phil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in.

           CUT TO:

          A SIGN
          "Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the
          World Since 1887." Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon
          GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his
          arm.
          The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts
          of town.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - LATER

          The van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are
          cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has
          been gaily festooned with banners and bunting.

          

          EXT . MOTEL - LATER
          The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The
          announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog
          Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99." The
          parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of
          other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and
          everybody gets out.
          Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head.

           PHIL
           (calls out)
           Rita! I can't stay here.
          Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van.

           LARRY

           (MUTTERING)
           Prima donnas.

           RITA
           It's okay. I'll handle it.
          She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another
          call on his earphone.

           RITA
           What's the problem, Phil?

           PHIL
           I hate this place. I stayed here
           two years ago and I was
           miserable. It's like a minimum
           security prison. I'm not staying
           here.

          

           -10-

          

          

           RITA
           You're not staying here.

           PHIL

           (BRIGHTENING)
           I ' m not?

           RITA
           No, Larry and I don't care but I
           thought you might, so I booked
           you at a very nice bed and
           breakfast on Cherry Street.

           Would you like to have dinner
           with Larry and me?

           PHIL
           No thanks, I've seen Larry eat.
           Why don't you ditch Larry and let
           me take you someplace nice?

           RITA
           You mean like a date?

           Okay. I get it. You're a little
           intimidated by me, you're all
           excited about the shoot tomorrow,
           you want everything to go just
           perfect. I understand. You just
           get some sleep. Tomorrow will be

          Phil sits up in bed and looks around the room. The decor is
          typical bed and breakfast, flocked wallpaper, framed prints,
          and an odd assortment of mismatched furniture. His suit is
          hanging neatly on the back of the closet door and his suitcase
          is open on a stand at the foot of the bed, still neatly packed.
          A iradio, DEEJAY and his SIDEKICK come on with hyped-up,

          Phil splashes some water on his face and prepares to shave.

           SIDEKICK (CONT.)
           Oh, here's the report: the
           National Weather Service is
           calling for a big blizzard thing.

          One wall is lined with .bookcases filled with books. A handful
          of guests are seated around the room, eating.
          The matron of the house, MRS. LANCASTER, spots Phil as she
          comes out of the kitchen with a fresh pot of coffee.

           to be like for all the
           festivities.

           PHIL

           overcast, high today in the low
           30's, dropping to the low 20's
           tonight, but I'm predicting that
           all that moisture coming up from
           the Gulf is going to miss us and
           dump some locally heavy snow,
           possibly blizzard conditions with
           travel advisories in the
           Harrisburg area and maybe as far

          joins the flow of pedestrian traffic on the street.

          There are a lot of people on the street for this hour. Traffic

          cars. Everyone seems to be going in the same direction, making
          the annual trek to see the groundhog.
          An OLD BUM is sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a
          storefront. Someone throws him a coin. Phil walks by without

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
           that was you!
          Phil looks at him vaguely.

           When I see an opportunity, I
           charge it, like a bull. Ned the

           tables, but I think it's all just
           a crap shoot anyhoo. Ever heard
           of single .premium life? That
           could be the ticket for you,

           Dinner? Umm, I don't think
           that's going to work for me.
          As they continue walking, Phil steps into what looks like a
          shallow puddle and ends up ankle deep in wet slush. Ned laughs
          like a donkey.

           NED
           Hey, look out for that first

          A big crowd is standing in a park-like clearing off a
          residential street. They are gathered around a large mound of
          dirt enclosed by a rail fence, waiting for the big moment. For
          a cold gray dawn, there is the atmosphere of a festival here.
          An area close to the mound is roped off for news reporters and
          cameras. Rita stands there, a pocket of genuine beauty in this
          sea of potbellied old union guys and blow-dried reporters.

          

           -17-

          

          
          Stomping her feet against the cold, Rita looks at her watch and
          glances around. Larry, the cameraman, just looks bored.

           Here he comes. Phil! Hey, Phil.

          Phil joins them in the press area. Rita pulls him to his mark

           PHIL

           You tossed and turned, didn't
           you?
          Rita holds up a slate for Larry to ID the tape.

          against the fence.

          cutaway coats parade out to the burrow that houses Punxsutawney

          Rita silently counts down from five and cues Phil who instantly
          snaps into announce mode.

           PHIL
           (to camera)
           Once a year, the eyes of the
           nation turn here, to this tiny
           hamlet in Pennsylvania, to watch
           a master at work. The master?
           Punxsutawney Phil, the world's
           most famous weatherman, the
           groundhog, who, as legend has it,
           can predict the coming of an
           early spring.
          Rita turns to Larry. This is impressive-- so far, so good.
          A Groundhog Club Official kneels at the burrow and
          ceremoniously knocks on the small wooden door, then opens it
          and retreats.

           PHIL
           And here's the big moment we've
           all been waiting for. Let's just
           see what Mr. Groundhog has to
           say.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks around, steps out of
          the hole, and runs over to the other side of the mound, about
          as far away from the cameras as he can get.

           PHIL
           Hey! Over here, you little
           weasel!
          Larry zooms in as far as he can but the best he can manage is
          a close-up of the groundhog's back. The groundhog stands there
          a moment, his body casting a long shadow, then he lets out a
          squeak and runs back into the hole.

           PHIL
           Great shot, huh, folks? Well,
           that was certainly worth the
           trip. Now we'll be hearing from
           Mr. Buster Greene, President of
           the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club,
           the so-called Seer of Seers who
           will interpret for us.
          BUSTER GREENE, dressed up in his top hat and cutaway coat,
          walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd.

           He came out, and he saw his
           shadow. Sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          The crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment.

           PHIL
           (sarcastic, to camera)
           Well, that's it. Sorry you
           couldn't be here in person to
           share the electric moment. This
           is one event where televison
           really fails to capture the
           excitement of thousands of people
           gathered to watch a large
           squirrel predict the weather, and
           I for one am deeply grateful to
           have been a part of it.
           Reporting for Channel 9, this is

           A real professional would have
           handled it. You acted like it
           was a personal insult. Who do
           you think you are -- Wolf Blitzer?

           PHIL
           God, you really take this stuff
           seriously, don't you.

           RITA
           Yes, I do. As far as I ' m
           concerned there are no little
           stories, Phil. Only little
           reporters with big egos who think
           they're too good for the job they
           have to do.

           PHIL
           (trying to look hurt)
           You really don't know me very
           well, do you. 'Cause if you did
           you could never say something
           like that about me. I care!
           Call me a cockeyed optimist but
           I happen to think there's more to
           this job than just getting my
           ugly mug on the boob tube every
           night.

           RITA
           Is that so.

           PHIL
           Yes, that is so.
          Rita is so irritated by him she can't even respond.
          Phil looks at her evenly for a long moment.

           PHIL
           So as far as us getting together,
           would you say the glass is half
           empty or half full?
          Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita
          and makes his way over to their table.

           LARRY
           (to Rita)
           You ready? We better get going
           if we ' re going to stay ahead of
           the weather.

           PHIL
           You don't have to rush off, you
           know. That storm is 'going to
           miss us completely.

           RITA
           Nice working with you, Phil. See
           you around.
           Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just
           starting to fall.

           PHIL(V.O)
           (on the earphone)
           I'll call you after I see the
           network guy. I should be back
           there in a couple of
           hours...What?...1 can't hear you--
           you're breaking up...Hello?
           Sabrina?

          

           INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates.
           The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield
           wipers.

           PHIL
           Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit!
           He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and
           notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the
           traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing
           moves.
           He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a
           parking lot.

           PHIL
           No. No!

          

           EXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the
           parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport
           shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin
           up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks
           on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he
           j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY

          "J PATROLMEN.

           Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1
           the road. Big accident up ahead.
           Blizzard movin1 in.

           PHIL
           What blizzard? A couple of
           flakes! An isolated phenomenon
           of nature.

           PATROLMAN
           Are you nuts? We got a major
           storm movin' in.

           PHIL
           No, no. All that moisture is
           going to miss us and hit
           Harrisburg.

           PATROLMAN
           Pal, you got that moisture on
           your head.

           PHIL
           But I have to get to Pittsburgh
           today!

           PATROLMAN
           Mister, the only place anybody's
           goin' on this road is back to
           Punxsutawney.
          Phil glowers at him and shivers.

          INT. GAS STATION - LATER

          Phil is on a pay phone. Snow is falling heavily outside.
          GAS STATION ATTENDANT is shovelling around the pumps.

           PHIL
           So all the long distance lines
           a re down? What about the
           sa tellite? Is it snowing in
           space?...But I have to call
           Pittsburgh...Isn't there some
           special line you keep open for
           emergencies or for
           celebrities?...Well, I'm both
           really. I'm a celebrity in an
           emergency. Can you patch me
           through on that line?

          

           -23-

          
          The door opens and Phil is blasted with frigid Arctic wind and
          blowing snow. The GAS STATION ATTENDANT enters the tiny office
          and in trying to squeeze past Phil accidentally bangs him on
          the head with his snow shovel.

          INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING

          Phil is at the bar in Punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the
          Pennsylvanian. He looks very bored, drinking a beer,
          unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named NANCY.

           PHIL
           You never saw me on TV-- on the
           news?

           NANCY
           I don't think so. What part of
           the news do you do?

           PHIL
           I ' m the White House correspondent
           for NBC news.

           NANCY
           Oh , I ' m so sure .

           PHIL
           Ask me anything?

           NANCY
           Okay, how big is the White House?

           PHIL
           Three bedrooms, two and a half
           baths. Looks much bigger than it
           , is.
          Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor.
          Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes
          into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS
          flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding
          but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux,
          comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST
          MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away.
          Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to
          Nancy .

           PHIL
           Good start. I ' m sure they'll be
           very happy. So what do you say?
           You want to play doggie obedience
           school with me?

          

           -24-

          

           NANCY
           Thanks. I'll pass.
          She gets up to leave.

           PHIL
           Sit! Stay!
          He watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits
          somewhat unsteadily.

          marked page .

          

          INT. CHERRY STREET INN - NIGHT - SAME TIME

          Phil enters his room and drunkenly tosses his overcoat, scarf
          and gloves on the floor in a heap.

          

          INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Stephanie Decastro, Phil ' s disaffected ex-lover, is sitting
          cross-legged on the floor with the book of curses open in front
          of her. Her hair is down, she's wearing a caftan with a Zodiac
          print, there are candles everywhere and other vaguely occult
          decorating touches.

          INSERT
          Phil's business card is dropped into a dish. Then the Tarot
          card of the Hanged Man, a chicken bone, and a feather are
          placed on top of it .

          PHIL
          He stands at the sink, looking at himself in the mirror,
          flexing his muscles .

          STEPHANIE
          Reading from the book> she mutters incantations in a secret
          language, then she sprinkles some powder on the plate, then a
          few drops of oil. Then she makes a few passes over it with her
          hands and, much to her surprise, the contents of the plate
          spontaneously combust.

          PHIL

          
          As he crosses to the bed, he accidentally knocks over the
          suitcase stand, spilling his clothes out onto the floor.

          He contemplates picking them up for a moment, decides to leave
          them there, and flops down on the bed. He lies there looking
          u up at the ceiling until the room starts to spin around, then
          he closes his eyes and quickly drops off to sleep, still fully
          clothed.

          STEPHANIE
          To complete the spell, she picks up a broken wristwatch and
          drops it into the fire.

          Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          Phil sits up in bed, quickly alert, and looks around the room.
          Something is wrong. He's wearing pajamas, his suit is once
          again hanging neatly on the closet door and his suitcase is
          back on its stand at the foot of the bed, again neatly packed.
          The song ends and the same radio deejay and his sidekick come
          on with the same manic energy. Phil stares at the radio and
          listens to them. A look of astonishment comes over his face as
          they banter.

           DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there
           today!

           It's cold out there everyday.
           What is this-- Miami Beach?
          The deejay laughs. Phil "mock" laughs at exactly the same
          time, recognizing the repartee from the previous morning.

           PHIL
           (to himself)
           Nice going guys. That's
           yesterday's tape.
          Phil crosses to the sink and gets a towel off the rack, only
          half-listening to the radio.

           know, blizzard thing --

           SIDEKICK
           That "blizzard thing?"
          Phil turns on the water and splashes some on his face as if
          trying to wake himself up, vaguely disturbed by the repetition
          of the broadcast.

           Oh, here's the report: the
           National Weather Service is
           calling for a big blizzard
           thing."

           DEEJAY
           Yes they are, but there's another
           reason today is very special --

           SIDEKICK
           Especially cold --

           DEEJAY
           Especially cold, okay, but the
           big question on everybody's lips --
          Phil supplies the next line in unison with the radio.

           SIDEKICK AND PHIL
           Chapped lips --

           DEEJAY
           -- on their chapped lips, right --

           out and see his shadow?

           SIDEKICK
           Punxsutawney Phil.
          Some vague doubt causes Phil to go to the window.

          breakfast room, the same Chubby Man passes.

           CHUBBY MAN

          his eyes.

           PHIL
           Don't mess with me, pork chop.
           What day is this?

           CHUBBY MAN

           (TERRIFIED)
           Febr uary second--Groundhog Day!
          Phil can see he's telling the truth and relaxes his grip on the
          poor man.

           PHIL
           Okay. Sorry. I'm having a bad
           day.
          Phil walks on, leaving the chubby man baffled and insulted.

          Phil enters the old library of the house and finds everything
          exactly as it was the day before. Mrs. Lancaster spots Phil as
          she comes out of the kitchen with the fresh pot of coffee.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Did you sleep well, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           (completely confused)
           D i d I? I don't know--

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Would you like some coffee?

           PHIL
           Yes, thank you. I ' m feeling a
           little strange.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           ( as she pours)
           I wonder what the weather's going
           to be like for all the
           festivities.

           PHIL
           Did you ever have deja vu, Mrs.
           Lancaster?

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Is that the Italian dessert with
           the brandy and the chocolate
           mousse?

           PHIL
           No, that's spaghetti. Never
           mind.
          He heads for the door, still in a daze.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Oh, will you be checking out
           today, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL

           (VAGUELY)
           I don't know. I don't think so.

          EXT. BOARDING HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

          Phil gulps down the steaming coffee, still trying to wake up
          from what he assumes is a dream, and descends the front steps
          of the house. He accosts a PASSERBY.

           PHIL
           Ma'am? Excuse me. Where's
           everybody going?

           PASSERBY
           To Gobbler's Knob. It's
           Groundhog Day!
          The coffee cup drops from Phil's hand as he stands there open-
          mouthed. Then he slaps his own face and shakes his head as if
          trying to clear it and starts off down the street.

          

          EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - CONTINUOUS

          Phil rushes down the street, again failing to notice the OLD
          BUM sitting on the sidewalk leaning against a storefront.

           NED RYERSON (O.C.)
           Hey, Phil!
          Ned Ryerson approaches with the same obnoxious attitude.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
           that was you!
          Phil just stares at him and keeps walking.

           NED
           My oh my! Phil Connors. Don't
           say you don't remember me, 'cause
           I sure as heck-fire remember you.

           PHIL
           To tell you the truth, Neddy, I ' m
           not feeling real well. Could you
           excuse me?

           NED
           Now it's funny you should mention
           your health 'cause you'll never
           guess what I do.

           desperate to get away
           from this guy)
           Do you sell insurance, Ned?

           NED
           Bing again! You're sharp as a
           tack today. Do you have life
           insurance, Phil? 'Cause if you
           do, I bet you could use more --
           who couldn't?" -- but I got a
           feeling you don't have any. Am
           I right?

           PHIL
           (really annoyed now)
           Did I say "fuck off, " Ned? I
           can't talk to you right now.
          He backs away from Ned and steps right into the same deep,
          slushy puddle he stepped in the day before.

           NED

           (BRAYING)
           Hey, look .out for that first v
           step. It's a doozyi
          Phil looks down at his wet shoes and cuffs and stumbles off
          toward Gobbler's Knob.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT . GOBBLER ' S KNOB - DAWN
          The crowd is gathered as before for the big moment.
          In the press area, Rita is having the same dialogue with Larry,
          when she spots Phil heading into the crowd.

           RITA
           Here he comes. Phill Hey, Phil!
           Over here!
          Phil waves to her and heads straight for an obscure corner of
          the Knob, gesturing for her to follow.
          Larry shakes his head as Rita charges through the crowd toward
          Phil. She catches up to him just as he is scratching a mark in
          the snow with his foot. She notices immediately that he is
          uncharacteristically dishevelled, his tie askew, his hair
          mussed.

           RITA
           Where ' ve you been?

           PHIL
           (nervous, sweat ing)
           I've got to talk to you. I think
           I'm losing my mind.

           . RITA
           I know you're losing it. What
           are you doing over here? The
           camera's over there.

           PHIL
           Slap me, Rita.

           RITA
           What is this?

           PHIL

           (INSISTENT)
           Just slap me-- hard.
          She gives up and taps him lightly on the cheek.

           PHIL
           I said hardl

          . . .. ... .RITA .
           I can't!

           PHIL
           Do it!
          Rita shrugs and slaps him very hard.

           PHIL
           (his cheek smarting)
           Better. Almost too hard, Rita.

           RITA
           Are you drunk?

           PHIL
           No, drunk is more fun. Can I be
           serious with you for a minute?

           RITA
           I don't know. Can you?

           PHIL
           Yes. I ' m being serious. I' m
           having a problem-- no, I may be
           having a problem.

           RITA
           What are you trying to say?

          

           -32-

          

           PHIL
           I'm trying to say that if I was
           having a problem, just
           hypothetical ly, I ' d like to know
           that you're someone I could count
           on in a crisis.

           RITA

           (WORRIED)
           What did you do last night?
          The crowd begins to hush.

           LARRY
           We better get started. We're
           going to miss it.

           PHIL
           Were not going to miss it.
           (indicating the other

           REPORTERS)
           They're going to miss it.

           RITA

           (EMPHATIC)
           Phil. We've been out here for an
           hour. We're cold and tired.
           Let's just get this and get out
           of here.

           PHIL
           Okay, put it here.

           RITA
           What?

           PHIL
           Put the camera here .
          Rita takes a forlorn glance towards the press area, where all
          of the other cameras are set up .

           RITA
           Phil , there is no tomorrow on
           this one. It's Groundhog Day.

           PHIL
           We were in the wrong spot
           yesterday .

           RITA

           W ha t? Yesterday? What are you
           talking about?

           PHIL
           Just trust me. Put the camera
           here .

          

           -33-

          

          
          Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and
          gives up.

           RITA
           Larry!
          She charges off toward the cameras.
          In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to
          their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any
          second now." Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to
          Phil.
          Larry hurriedly sets up the camera.

           LARRY
           You want me to roll tape?

           RITA
           (to Phil)
           Are you going to get on your
           mark?

           PHIL
           No hurry.
          Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to
          their cameras and pointing towards the mound.

           LARRY

           (DESPERATELY)
           Everyone else is rolling!
          Rita looks helplessly at Phil.

           RITA
           I'm begging you, all right?
           Gould we please just do this?
          Phil glances down at his watch.

           PHIL
           Okay, let's do it.
          He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder.

           PHIL
           Roll tape.

           LARRY

           (MUMBLING)
           Prima donnas.
          Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself
          against the fence.

           LARRY
           Rolling.

          

           -34-

          
          Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this
          time it's a bit tentative.

           PHIL
           (to camera)
           We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again--
           and you know what that means.
           Everybody's here on Gobbler's
           Knob waiting in the cold for the
           appearance of the most famous
           groundhog in the world,
           Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to
           tell us just how much more of
           this we can expect.
          The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door,
          then opens it and retreats.
          Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental
          prediction, recalling the previous day.

           PHIL
           My forecast is we're going to see
           the groundhog peek its head out
           of its hole, look around a little
           bit, then he's going to come out,
           scamper over to this general
           area, look at the crowd for a
           second, make a little burping
           noise and run back into the
           ground.

           RITA
           (whispers to Larry)
           That's it. I'm going to kill
           him.
          Phil looks at his watch.

           PHIL
           O k ay ? And here we go--
          Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in.
          The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right,
          steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool,
          directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body
          casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the
          camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole.
          Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the
          brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil.
          Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog
          burrow.

          

           -35-

          

           RITA

           (HISSES)
           Phil!
          Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the
          mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before.

           BUSTER
           He came out, and he saw his
           shadow. Sorry, ladies and
           gentlemen, but it looks like it's
           going to be a long winter.
          Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in
          disappointment.
          Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in
          a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita.

           RITA
           (at a loss)
           For Channel 9 News, this is Rita
           Hanson in Punxsutawney.
          She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her
          finger across her throat.

          INT; PHIL'S ROOM
          Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call.

           PHIL
           (on the phone)
           I know there's a blizzard, but I
           have to get a call through to my
           doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a
           medical emergency. . . .No, don't
           give me the Punxsutawney Fire
           Department. When do you think
           the long distance lines will be
           working again?. . . But what if we
           don't have a tomorrow? We didn't
           have one today, my friend...
           Hello...Hello?
          He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to
          ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls
          the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes
          a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the
          pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and
          retreats back under the covers.

          CLOSE UP - CLOCK
          The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The
          radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I
          Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN

          Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the
          nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by
          the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing
          hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap.

           DEEJAY
           Okay, campers, rise and shine,
           and don't forget your booties
           because it's COOOLD out there
           today!

           SIDEKICK
           It's cold out there everyday.
           What is this-- Miami Beach?
          Phil rushes out of the room.

           CUT TO:

          

          EXT. CHERRY STREET - LATER

          Phil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon
          buckets of paint, and a couple of big bags from a hardware
          store.

          

          INT. BED AND BREAKFAST - CONTINUOUS

          Phil enters and passes Mrs. Lancaster in the breakfast room.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Painting something, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           I ' m conducting an experiment.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - LATER

          Phil enters and dumps the bags on the bed. Out fall a couple
          of big paintbrushes, a small sledgehammer, a handsaw, a
          crowbar, plastic goggles and assorted other tools. He puts on
          the goggles, grabs a hammer and some nails and starts nailing
          the door shut.

           -37-

          

          EXT. CORRIDOR - LATER

          Mrs. Lancaster and several other guests are gathered in the
          hall outside Phil's room, listening at the door and looking
          very worried. Loud music is playing inside the room.
          From inside the room, they hear the sound of loud hammering,
          wood splintering and glass breaking.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Phil, has demolished just about all the furniture and woodwork
          in the room. He rips off the last of the wooden moldings with
          the crowbar, then crosses to the mirror over the demolished
          sink.
          Phil stands there, staring at his image in the mirror, trying
          to figure out what's happening to him. He starts breathing
          heavier, as if gathering courage, then, just when we think he's
          going to cut off his ear or something, he raises an electric
          barber clipper and shaves a bald stripe up the middle of his
          head. He studies his new look for a moment then smashes the
          mirror with his sledgehammer.
          Then he opens the cans of paint, dips the two big brushes into
          the cans and starts slapping bright red paint onto the walls,
          madly, feverishly, splashing himself and everything else in the
          room with it.
          As a final touch he grabs the bed pillows and rips them open,
          then shakes them all around the room creating a storm of
          feathers.
          Finally, Phil falls exhausted on the bed. From outside we can
          hear outraged hotel employees pounding on the door.
          We pan over to the clock radio, the only undamaged object in
          the room. Feathers drift down past the face of the clock which
          reads 5:59 AM. The time changes to 6:00, the radio clicks on
          and "I Got You, Babe" starts playing as we pan back to Phil
          sleeping on the bed.
          He opens his eyes, jumps out of bed and looks around. No
          paint, no feathers, no damage. Everything is as clean and tidy
          as the day he checked in.
          He races over to the unbroken mirror and looks at himself. His
          hair is completely restored, as if it had never been shaved.
          The song ends and the deejays come on. Phil says every word
          right along with them, shocked into a state of complete
          wonderment.

          

           -38-

          

           PHIL AND DEEJAY

          completely professional despite the circumstances.

           PHIL
           (with forced good

           HUMOR)
           . . . S o according to Mr. Groundhog
           I guess we can expect six more
           weeks of winter. It's not very
           scientific, but it sure is fun.
           Hey, wait a second. If he's
           right, I could be out of a job!
           (mock laugh)
           For Channel 9 News, this is Phil
           Connors in Punxsutawney .
          He holds until Larry stops tape, then approaches Rita.

           How was that?

           RITA

           (PLEASED)
           It was good. A little smarmy for
           my taste, but I guess that's what
           sells.

           PHIL
           Could I talk to you about a
           matter that is not work related?

           RITA
           You never talk about work.

           No, it's okay. This morning it
           was all right again. That's what

          accident. As an ambulance arrives, Phil and Rita enter the
          cozy looking diner on the corner.

           do exactly the same thing every

           Big time. Rita, I know it's nuts
           but I keep reliving the same day
           o ve r and over-- Groundhog Day--
           today. This is the third time.

           RITA
           (completely skeptical)
           Uh-huh. I'm waiting for the
           punchline.

           PHIL
           No, really. It's like today
           never happened. I shaved my head
           last night, today its all grown
           back. I could probably cut off
           my limbs, one by one, and - pop!
           They'd grow back. Just like a
           starfish. I probably don't even
           have to floss?

           RITA
           I'm wracking my brain, but I
           can't even begin to imagine why
           you'd make up something like
           this.

           PHIL
           'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm
           asking for your help.
          Rita looks at him for a long moment.

           Okay, I'll bite. What do you
           want me to do?

           the next 24 hours with me and
           don't leave my side for a second.

          Phil slips off his glove as Ned Ryerson lumbers toward him.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors!

           PHIL
           Ned! Ned Ryerson! Ned the Head!
          Before Ned can say another word, Phil SLUGS HIM. Ned goes
          down, Phil puts his glove back on and keeps walking.
          Phil deftly avoids the slushy pothole he stepped in before. A
          PEDESTRIAN walking behind him steps right into it.

          Phil is passing through the crowd on his way to the press area
          when he notices NANCY, the girl he met at the hotel bar, and
          stops to talk to her.

           PHIL
           You here to see the groundhog?
          She gives him a look. It's obvious she's never seen him
          before.

           NANCY
           Can you think of another reason
           anybody'd be out here at dawn on
           a freezing day?

           PHIL
           What's your name?

           NANCY
           Nancy Taylor. And you are--

           I'm not really sure. We'll have

          Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an
          incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage,
          pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc.
          Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs
          himself with pastry.

           RITA
           Is this some new fad diet? Don't
           you worry about cholesterol?
          Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate
          eclair.

           PHIL
           I don't worry about anything
           anymore.

           RITA
           What makes you so special?
           Everybody worries about
           something.

           PHIL
           That's exactly what makes me so
           special.
          He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head.

           CIGARETTES)
           Okay if I smoke?
          Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette.

           RITA
           You really do have a death wish,
           don't you?

           PHIL
           Just the opposite, Rita. I have
           a life wish. I'm just trying to
           enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the
           little things. Don't you ever
           just want to cut loose and go
           wild?

           RITA
           I wouldn't even know what it
           means to go wild.

           PHIL
           Yeah, well, that's where I come
           in. Going wild is one of my
           specialties. Last night I got
           completely loaded and drove head-
           on into a police car.

           RITA

           (DISBELIEVING)
           Oh, really? You look pretty good
           this morning.

           PHIL
           That's my point. I know you
           won't believe me, but we could do
           anything we want today and it
           wouldn't matter one bit.
           Absolutely no consequences.
           Complete and total freedom.

           RITA
           And how. . , do we manage that?

           PHIL
           You leave that to me. Why don't
           you send Larry back and hang out
           with me for the rest of the day?
           You never make it through that
           blizzard anyway.
          Larry enters the diner and spots them.

           Oh , Rita .
          The woman suddenly freezes. There is a moment of silence, then
          she snaps on the light. It's Nancy, not Rita. Phil is as
          surprised as she is by his slip of the tongue.

           NANCY

           Who's Rita?

           PHIL

           (CAUGHT)
           No one. It's just something I
           say when I make love. You know --
           "Orita", "Orighta"-- it's like
           "Oh, baby" or something.

          Phil is standing at the bookcase, wearing only pajamas,
          absently munching on a Danish as he reads from one of the
          books.
          Mrs. Lancaster approaches him.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Isn't it a wonderful collection?

           PHIL
           (not looking up)
           Yes, it is. You don't usually
           find this many trashy novels in
           one place.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           You can take a book up to your
           room if you like.

           PHIL
           No, thank you. I've actually
           read them all. I was just
           rereading some of the dirty
           parts.
          He finishes and puts the book back on the shelf.

           How long will you be staying with
           us, Mr. Connors?

           PHIL
           Indefinitely. I've already been
           here for 211 days.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           (humoring him)
           Really? That's quite a long
           time, isn't it. I hope you're
           finding things to do in our
           little town.

           PHIL

           (CASUALLY)
           Yes, well, I'm getting a little
           tired of casual sex so today I
           thought I'd rob a bank and buy
           myself a really expensive car.

          women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off

          shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes
          against the door.

           Psychic. So did you have a nice
           evening?

           RITA

           (GUARDED)
           I just had a sandwich, watched
           some TV and went to bed.

           PHIL
           I got my whole body tattooed and
           part ied all night with some
           nymphomaniac biker chicks.

           RITA

           (SKEPTICAL)
           Sounds wholesome. Were those the
           new 24-hour disappearing tattoos
           or can I see them?

           PHIL
           No, they're gone. Rita, if you
           only had one day to live, what
           would you do with it?

           dying of?

           PHIL
           No, I mean like what if the
           entire world was about to
           explode?

           the weekend?
          She starts walking toward the center of town. Phil sticks
          right with her.

           PHIL
           No, I just want to know you
           better. What do you like, what
           do you want, what do you think
           about, what kind of men are you
           interested in, what do you do for
           fun?

           Is this real or are you just
           going to make me feel like a
           fool?

           I'm just trying to talk to you
           like a normal person. Isn't this
           how normal people talk?

           Close.

           I guess I want what everybody
           wants-- you know, career, love,
           marriage, children. So far I
           don't have any of it.

           I have a job. Doing stories on
           the Punxsutawney groundhog is not
           my ultimate goal. No offense.

           How about the other stuff? You
           seeing anybody?

           This is getting too personal. I
           don't think I ' m ready to discuss
           these things with you. What
           about you? What do you want?

           Why not?

           RITA
           Phil, you know, you have so much
           talent and ability. If you'd

          She stares hard at him.

           RITA
           I don't know. It's sort of like
           the way I feel about UFO's. I'd
           have to see it to believe it.

           Why don't you stay for a while?
           The road's going to be closed
           anyway. Do you really want to be
           stuck in the van with Larry for

          fashioned, wholesome.
          A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to
          see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The
          kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing
          snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little
          gang of friends.
          A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a
          snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no

           (shaking her head)
           Oh, no. I can't believe I fell
           for it. This whole day was just
           one long set-up. And I ate
           fudge. Yucchh! I hate fudge.

           No, it was real. I love you.

          turn it off. He lies there for a moment, then hefts himself
          heavily out of bed, not eager to repeat the day yet another
          time. With the radio off, Phil does the deejays' morning
          routine himself, seemingly for the millionth time.

           No, I guess not. I thought you
           were someone else.
          Phil wanders over to where Rita and Larry are setting up the
          camera. Rita comes over to him.

          Phil walks past the front desk looking very haggard and
          dangerous, and enters the children's section. No one is
          present except the CHILDREN'S LIBRARIAN, a young woman,
          reshelving books in the stacks. He looks around quickly and
          sees a window in the wall and over it a large sign which reads:
          "Punxsutawney Phil - The Great Prognosticates"
          Phil heads right for it.
          The groundhog scurries around his little temperature-controlled
          habitat, oblivious to the approaching danger.
          As Phil approaches the groundhog display, he reaches into his
          overcoat and pulls out a pump shotgun with a short pistol grip.
          The children's librarian sees the gun and freezes.
          Phil pumps a shell into the chamber as he walks right up to the
          case.

          The groundhog looks right into his sights.
          Philsqueezes the trigger. LOUD GUNSHOT.
          The glass window is still intact, not a scratch on it. The
          groundhog looks up playfully.
          Phil fires off four more rounds but, again, no results. Phil
          can't believe it. He charges the glass and pounds it with the
          rifle butt. He can't even chip it. Suddenly he is seized from
          behind by TWO STRONG MEN who take the rifle from him and
          wrestle him to floor.
          The librarian comes running up and looks at the groundhog.

          madness.
          Suddenly, Phil whips out a big kitchen knife from under his

          The cars chase the pickup to the top of the mountain.

           BUSTER
           Okay! I know this road. There's
           no way off ' cept the way we come
           up.

          The pickup is losing its lead over the pursuers as it nears the
          sharp mountain cliff.

          

          INT. THE PICKUP - SAME TIME

          Phil looks in his rearview mirror at the cars chasing him. He
          glances down at the groundhog. He takes a breath.

           PHIL
           Okay, pal. It's showtime.
          Phil hits the gas.

          

          INT. THE NEWS VAN - SAME TIME

          Larry is taping as Rita comes around the curve just in time to
          see the pickup truck speeding toward the cliff. Rita hits the
          brakes and watches in horror.

           PHIL! NO!

          

          

          EXT. LOGGER'S LEAP - CONTINUOUS

          The pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over
          the edge of the cliff.
          The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it
          begins its SLOW MOTION descent, falling ever so gracefully
          until it impacts on the granite rock face far below.
          BIG EXPLOSION. BIG FIREBALL. FLAMING WRECKAGE. Then a small
          click, followed by "I Got You, Babe."

          He slowly opens his eyes and blinks. He looks around and
          realizes he's back in his room at the bed and breakfast.

           PHIL
           Ah, nuts!

          Ned and a client are huddled over his desk, looking at some
          papers. A BODY DROPS quickly past the window behind them.
          It's Phil.
          They rush to the window and look down at the sidewalk three
          stories below. Phil is sprawled there like a broken puppet,
          lifeless.

          Rita and Larry are walking down the street when a GREYHOUND BUS
          pulls out of the bus station and accelerates down Main Street.
          Suddenly, Phil, dressed in pajamas and overcoat, leaps out in
          front of the speeding bus. Rita witnesses the whole incident.

          D RIVERS' POV
          He sees Phil through the windshield but doesn't even have time
          to hit the brakes before he runs right over Phil.

          the corridor behind her, Phil walks by, dressed in a robe,
          carrying an electric toaster and a towel, heading for the
          bathroom.
          A few moments pass.
          We hear the zap of an electrocution, the lights and TV flicker

          Suddenly, the doors burst open and Phil comes running out of
          the bank screaming, dressed in camouflage fatigues and armed to
          the teeth with an assault rifle in one hand, an Uzi in the
          other and a couple of handguns stuck in his belt. He doesn't
          get three feet before he is shot down in an incredible hail of
          gunfire.
          Rita stands beside the camera gaping in horror while Larry
          records the grisly massacre.

          Rita stands by weeping while Phil's body is covered with a

          In the shadowy darkness under the sheet, a CLICK is heard and
          Phil's eyes pop open. "I Got You, Babe" plays.

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           I ' m sorry. What was that again?

           PHIL
           I'm a god.

           RITA
           You're God?

           PHIL
           No, I'm A god. Not THE God-- at
           least I don't think I am.

           RITA
           That's reassuring. For a mintute
           there I thought you might be
           crazy.

           PHIL
           No, it's true. It's the only
           possible explanation. I'm a
           supernatural being.

           RITA
           Because you survived a car wreck?

          The waiter comes to the table.

           WAITER
           Are you ready to order?

           PHIL
           (to Rita, ignoring the

           WAITER)
           Not just the car wreck! I didn't
           just blow up yesterday, you know.
           I've been run over, drowned,
           crushed, stabbed, shot,
           electrocuted, poisoned, frozen,
           burn ed, and asphyxiated--

           RITA
           Really?
          The waiter looks at him like he's nuts.

           PHIL
           --but I always wake up the next
           day without a scratch, without
           even a headache. I'm telling

           WAITER
           The special today is blueberry
           waffles.

           Why are you telling me this?

           WAITER

           (SHRUGS)
           Because some people like

           No t you-- him.

           PHIL
           Because I want you to believe in
           me.

           RITA
           You're not a god, Phil. Take my
           word for it. This is twelve
           years of Catholic school talking.

           WAITER
           I could come back if you're not
           ready.

           RITA
           Because it's not possible.

           I'll come back.
          The /waiter turns to leave.

           PHIL
           Hey, Billy!
          The waiter turns back.

           PHIL
           This is Bill. He's been a waiter
           for three years because he left
           Penn State and had to find work.
           He likes the town, he paints toy
           soldiers, and he's gay.

          Phil grabs an astonished Rita and pulls her over to the next
          table.

           RITA
           What are you doing?

           PHIL
           This is Doris Kleiser and her
           fiance Fred.

           DORIS
           Do I know you?

           PHIL
           They're supposed to get married
           tonight but Doris is having
           second thoughts.

           FRED
           What!
          Doris touces her engagement ring, dumbfounded. Rita is a
          little embarrassed.

           RITA
           Lovely ring.

          Rita flashes a quick smile.

           wants to drive around town
           smashing into policemen.

           RALPH
           Well, who don't?

           RITA
           This is some kind of trick.

           PHIL
           Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the
           real God cheats, too. Maybe God
           isn't omnipotent-- he's just had
           a lot of practice.

           RITA
           How about that guy?

           PHIL
           Tom. Worked in the coal mine
           ·til they shut it down.

           Nancy. Went to Lincoln High
           School in Pittsburgh. Takes
           herself out to lunch once a week.
          Rita is getting very bewildered. From their reactions she can
          see that Phil is right about each and every one of them.

           RITA
           How do you know these people!

           PHIL
           I told you the truth. In five
           seconds there's going to be a
           grease fire in the kitchen.
           Five, four--

           RITA
           This is nuts.

           --three, two, one.
          Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the
          service window. Everyone in the diner is now staring at them

           RITA
           (trying to puzzle it

           OUT)
           Okay, enough. Let's just sit
           down and think for a second.
           (they sit)
           What do you know about me, Phil?
           Do you know me, too?
          Phil takes a long pause.

           PHIL
           I know all about you, Rita. I
           know you like producing, but hope
           for better than Channel 9,
           Pittsburgh.

           RITA
           Everyone knows that.

           PHIL
           You like boats but not the ocean.
           There's a lake you go to in the
           summer with your family, up in
           the mountains, with an old wooden
           dock and a boathouse with boards
           missing in the roof, and a place
           you used to crawl underneath to
           be alone, and at night you'd look
           up and see the stars. You're a
           sucker for Rocky Road, Marlon
           Brando, and French poetry.
           You're wonderfully generous;
           you're kind to strangers, and
           children; and when you stand in
           the snow, you look like an angel.

          

           RITA
           How are you doing this?

           PHIL
           I told you! I wake up every day
           right here, right in
           Punxsutawney, and it's always
           February second and I can't turn
           it off. If you still don't

           Listen! In ten seconds Larry is
           going to walk through that door
           and take you away from me.

           RITA
           Larry?

           PHIL
           But you can't let him. Please
           believe me. You've got to
           believe me.

           RITA
           I don't --
          Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around and spots
          Rita.

           PHIL
           Look.
          As Rita turns around to see Larry, Phil grabs a pen and pad
          from a passing waitress and quickly writes something down as
          Larry makes his way to their table. Phil finishes writing.

           LARRY
           (to Rita)
           You ready? We better get going
           if we're going to stay ahead of
           the weather.
          Phil hands the paper to Rita. She reads it.

           RITA

           (READING)
           " . . . stay ahead of the weather. "
          Larry looks at the paper.

           You weren't interested.

           I used to try to stay up all

           could stay conscious I could
           figure out what was going on, or
           at least hang onto something from
           the day before. But I gave up on
           that a long time ago.

           It sounds so-- lonely.

           It's not that bad. You get used

          Rita comes to a decision.

           RITA
           Maybe I should spend the rest of
           the day with you-- as an
           objective witness. Just to see
           what happens. Okay?

           PHIL
           Yeah, sure. That'd be okay.

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A hat is lying on Phil's bed. A playing card flies past. A
          second playing card sails right into the hat. Another playing
          card sails past, missing. Another playing card sails right in
          Phil and Rita are tossing cards. Rita is missing. Phil is
          hitting.

           PHIL
           It's not in the wrist so much as
           the fingers. Be the hat.

           RITA
           It would take me a year to get
           good at this.

           PHIL
           Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five
           hours a day.

           RITA
           Is this what you do with
           eternity?

          

           -93-

          

          

           PHIL
           Now you know. It's like waiting
           for a bus that never comes . You
           should see me play pool -- and
           bowling, juggling, hacky sack.
           I can ride a unicycle.
          There ' s a knock on the door .

           PHIL
           I'll get it!
          Phil jumps for the door and opens it. The PIZZA GUY is there.

           PHIL
           Hi, Marty. $11.75 including the
           delivery charge, right?

           PIZZA GUY
           U h hh h --
          Phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door.

           RITA
           (opening the pizza box)
           MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My
           favorite .

           PHIL
           Of course. I told you, I know
           everything .

           RITA
           (taking a bite of

           PIZZA)
           I don ' t think I ' d want to know
           everything that ' s going to
           happen. I like to be surprised.

           PHIL
           That's not the worst part.

           RITA
           What's the worst part?

           PHIL
           The worst part is starting over
           everyday. Tomorrow you won't
           remember any of this. You'll go
           back to treating me like a
           complete jerk --

           RITA
           No --

           PHIL
           It's not your fault. I am a
           jerk.

          

           -94-

          

          

           RITA
           No, you're not.

           PHIL
           Okay, I ' m not. It really doesn't
           make a lot of difference. I've
           killed myself so many times, I
           don't even exist anymore. I'm
           just completely empty.

           RITA
           Or completely clean.

           PHIL
           If you're going to be this
           positive all the time I may have
           to rough you up a little.

           RITA
           Wait! Have we done this before?

           PHIL
           Which part?

           RITA
           You getting me up here, the card
           gam e, the pizza--

           PHIL
           No, this is the first time.

           RITA

           (EXCITED)
           Well?

           PHIL
           Well, what?

           RITA
           Well how does it feel to be doing
           something completely new?
          Phil looks at her with tremendous affection and gratitude.

           PHIL
           Good. Really good.
          He takes a slice of pizza and starts eating with gusto.

           DISSOLVE TO:

          THE PIZZA BOX - LATER
          There's only one slice left.
          Phil and Rita are sitting together on the bed, close but not
          touching. Soft music is playing on the radio.

          

           -95-

          

          

           RITA
           Sometimes I wish I had a thousand
           lifetimes. One to be a great
           journalist. One to, I don't
           know, go back to school, study
           art, or auto mechanics. One just
           to take care of all the busywork,
           you know, pay the bills, get my
           car tuned up. One to be the wild
           woman of Borneo. One to be
           Mother Theresa. Maybe it's not
           a curse, Phil. It all just
           depends on how you look at it.
          Phil stares at her for a long time letting this sink in. Then
          he belches really loud. Rita stares at him, then burps
          surprisingly loud herself.

           RITA
           I want you to know, it's been a
           really nice day for me.

           PHIL
           Me, too.

           RITA
           Maybe, if it's not too boring for
           you, we could do it again.

           PHIL
           I hope so.
          The clock reads 11:59. Rita grabs Phil's hand. He puts his
          arm around her.
          They look into each others' eyes. Rita gives Phil a reassuring
          smile. She squeezes his hand. Their eyes turn to the clock.
          11:;59 turns to 12:00.
          Rita looks up at Phil as if expecting some magical event.

           RITA
           You're still here!

           PHIL
           I know.

           RITA
           I thought you were supposed to
           disappear-- or I was or
           something.

           PHIL
           Not 'til six.

           RITA
           You rat!

          

           -96-

          

          
          She is mad in a playful way.

           PHIL
           I never said midnight--

           RITA
           You knew I was waiting for
           midnight!

           PHIL
           But I never said it.

           RITA
           Oh, I can't believe you!
           (she slugs him with a

           PILLOW)
           I didn't know this was going to
           take all night!

           PHIL
           Does that mean you're going?

           RITA
           No.
          Phil takes Rita's hand. She doesn't resist.

           DISSOLVE TO:

          LATER
          Rita is now sitting right next to Phil on the bed, her head
          resting on his shoulder. She nods off then catches herself.

           RITA
           I'm sorry.

           PHIL
           It's okay to go to sleep you
           know. I promise I won't touch
           you-- much.

           RITA
           No, it's all right. I'm not
           tired. What were you saying?
          Her eyes start to close again.

           PHIL
           I was saying that the cow was
           eventually returned to it's
           rightful owner.

           RITA
           (drifting off)
           Really?

          

           -97-

          

          

           PHIL
           That's right.
          He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers
          her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. Then he
          carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to
          her.

           PHIL
           What I was going to say was, I
           think you're the kindest,
           sweetest, prettiest, most
           wonderful girl I ever met in my
           life.
          She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep.

           PHIL
           Shhhh. That's good.
           (satisfied she's still

           ASLEEP)
           I could never tell you this, but
           from the first minute I looked at
           you I wanted to just hold you
           close and be with you forever.
           iEverytime I -saw you around the
           station, I thought my heart was
           going to explode. I used to
           dream about us being together.
           In my dream you loved me as much
           as I loved you and we didn't have
           to say anything but I knew you
           understood everything.
          She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep
          sleep.

           PHIL
           I know a guy like me could never
           deserve to have someone like you,
           but if I did, I swear I would
           love you for the rest of my life.
          Rita opens her eyes.

           RITA

           (HALF-ASLEEP)
           Did you say something?

           PHIL
           Good-night, Rita.
          He kisses her gently on the forehead.

           RITA
           Good-night, Phil.

          The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing.
          Phil wakes up alone in bed. He lies there for a moment then
          leaps out of bed like a man reborn and heads straight for the
          shower.

           Rita?
          She looks at him without a trace of the rapport they shared the
          night before.

           RITA
           Oh, hi, Phil.

           PHIL
           Thought you might like some--
          He hands her the coffee.

           Thanks!

           Careful, it's hot. Larry?
          He hands Larry a cup.

           Yeah, great.

           RITA
           We're just setting up.

           PHIL
           You know, I bumped into Buster
           Greene, he kind of runs this
           thing, and he tipped me off that
           we might get a better shot over
           there.

          She reaches for an equipment case.

           PHIL
           I'll get that.
          Phil helps Larry carry the camera gear.

           PHIL
           In fact, the groundhog's
           legendary ability to predict the
           weather may be more than just the
           German folklore of the region.
           Higher temperatures trigger
           hormonal changes in the
           testosterone levels of male
           groundhogs, which may in fact
           wake them from hibernation and
           send them out to battle with
           other males ;for mating rights.
           So, the truth is they're not
           looking for their shadows,
           they're looking for groundhog
           chicks.

           Groundhog Day, February second,
           also known as Candlemas Day or
           the Feast of the Purification of
           the Virgin Mary, the day Mary
           first came to the temple for
           ritual blessings following the
           birth of the infant Jesus, and
           celebrated since the Middle Ages
           by the sacramental lighting of
           candles. Hence the old Scottish
           couplet which long predates the
           .American groundhog tradition: "If
           Candlemas dawns bright and clear,
           there'll be two winters in the

           RITA
           I don't know. From my freshman
           Philosophy course, I guess.
          They both laugh. Then she looks at him for a long moment and
          grins.

           PHIL
           What?

           RITA
           Nothing. I just can't believe
           you're such a fine sculptor.
          Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.

           PHIL
           I gotta go.

           RITA
           Where do you have to go in
           Punxsutawney?

           PHIL
           I got piano and then drums.

           RITA
           Here?

           PHIL

          Larry who is waiting on the other side.
          Across the street, Rita takes a wistful glance toward Phil,
          then gets in the news van and drives off.
          Phil gets out of the car and starts walking, but finds himself
          face to face with Ned Ryerson.

           NED
           Phil! Phil Connors! I thought
           that was you!

           PHIL
           Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don't

           much.

          Phil gives Ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an
          uncomfortably long time, actually giving Ned a hickey on the
          neck. Ned goes into homophobic shock.

           NED
           Uh, I gotta get going. Nice to
           see you, Phil.

          he passes, stops, walks back and enters the alley. The OLD BUM
          that Phil never noticed before is lying there, huddled against
          a wall. Phil goes to help him.

           PHIL
           Hey, mister. Hey. Come on,
           let's get you somewhere warm.
          The old bum turns to look at Phil, then closes his eyes.

          MARIE, a little nine-year-old girl, approaches the intersection
          shielding her brand new puppy under her winter coat. She isn't
          paying attention to traffic and fails to notice a big truck
          bearing down on her.
          As she steps off the curb, Phil arrives and, with split-second
          timing, nonchalantly but firmly grabs her coat to hold her
          back, just as the big truck rushes past in the street, narrowly
          missing her.

           Hey! Did you forget to look both

          A bolus of food flies across the room. The victim coughs and
          sputters, then starts breathing again.

           How did you know?

          

           -114-

          

           FRED
           We're like going to be in
           Pittsburgh anyway.

           PHIL
           I don't know. I just thought
           about you two, tried to picture
           what you ' d want more than
           anything in the world and it came
           to me. Bing! Wrestlemania.

           FRED
           Thanks, Mr. Connors. You're a
           real pal.

           DORIS
           This is the best!
          Doris gives Phil a kiss. She and Fred move on.

           RITA
           I don ' t understand . You rush
           from one person to the next in a
           town you only visit once a year,
           you know everything before it
           happens , and you -- - I don ' t know ,
           you seem to be Punxsutawney ' s
           leading citizen.
          The band finishes a set. The guests stop dancing and head for
          the refreshments. Phil and Rita are left alone for the moment

           PHIL
           What do you want to know?

           RITA
           Who are you?

           PHIL
           I really don't know.

           RITA
           No, there's something going on
           with you.

           PHIL
           Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney
           on February second -- every day.
           It's supernatural. I don't even
           try to explain it anymore. So,
           I live each day as if it's the
           only day I've got.
          Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only
          good, true things.

           RITA
           That's pretty amazing. "

          

           -115-

          

           PHIL
           You want to know what's really
           amazing? I've been waiting for
           you every day for ten thousand
           years. I dream of you every
           night of my life. You've been my
           constant weapon against total
           despair, and just knowing you
           exist has kept me alive. How's
           that?
          Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing
          anybody has ever said to anybody.
          Mary the piano teacher notices Phil.

           MARY
           Phil!
           (to her friend)
           This is the guy.

           PHIL
           Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one
           of Punxsey's finest musicians.

           ·MARY
           Give me a break. You should
           talk. Why don't you play
           something?

           PHIL
           N o , I--

           MARY
           Please.

           FRED
           Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it.
          Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs.
          Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins
          to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls
          silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears.
          Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil
          transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp.
          Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in,
          everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance.
          An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up
          a storm.

           LEO
           That's a great guy you've got
           there. Doctor Connors fixed my
           back, you know.

           RITA
           Do ctor Connors?

          
          Rit a looks over at Phil, joyously playing the piano.

          

           CUT TO:

          

          

          EXT . STREET - NIGHT

          
          It is snowing lightly. Phil and Rita are walking slowly, arm
          in arm, close. They stop and embrace. Phil looks at Rita.
          She looks like an angel.

          

           PHIL
           Wait! Don't move!

          
          Phil scoops up some snow and begins packing it down, furiously,
          joyously, then rolling it into a large ball.

          

           RITA
           Making a snow man? I'll help.

          

           PHIL
           No, stay there. Stand right
           th ere.

          
          Ph il lifts the now larger chunk of packed snow and sets it on
          a mailbox. Then he looks at her, and starts to sculpt it.

          

           DISSOLVE TO:

          

          LATER

          
          Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model
          a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look
          o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work.

          

           RITA
           Can I look?

          

           PHIL
           O kay, look.

          
          It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as
          alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.

          

           RITA

           (OVERWHELMED)
           Nobody's ever done this for me.
           Not even a drawing. It's
           beautiful.

          

           -117-

          

           PHIL
           This is how I see you. When it
           all gets too much, I just close
           my eyes and there you are-- just
           like this. Take it home and keep
           it in the freezer.
          Rita embraces Phil. They are about to kiss, looking deep into
          each others eyes.

           PHIL
           This one's for the Frog Prince.

           RITA
           What?

           PHIL
           Nothing.
          They kiss-- a long, deep, soul-stirring kiss.

           PHIL
           Will you come with me?
          Rita nods. They continue standing there, embracing, warming
          each other in the cold night air.

           RITA
           (looks back at the ice

           SCULPTURE)
           We're just going to leave her?

           PHIL
           It doesn't matter. Really, it
           doesn't.
          They kiss again.

           CUT TO:

          CLOSE UP - THE CLOCK
          The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00. Silence.
          No Sonny and Cher, no deejays-- nothing.
          Phil sits up in bed. He looks around the room. Things are
          different, messier. Then he sees the covers move. Wide-eyed
          now, he looks over and sees Rita waking up, snuggling deep
          under the covers.

           PHIL

           (DISBELIEVING)
           It's not true. It's not. It
           can't be true. Rita? Rita!

          

           -118-

          

           RITA

           (STRETCHING

           LUXURIOUSLY)
           Mmmm. Morning.
          Phil pounces on Rita, showering her with kisses.

           PHIL
           You're here! My god! I can't
           believe you're here!

           RITA
           Glad to see you, too.

           PHIL
           No! It's happened. Don't you
           get it? It's tomorrow! It's --
          Phil turns on the radio.

           DEEJAY
           . . . still shoveling put the
           highways, but if you're walking,
           it's a beautiful day.

           S IDEKICK
           Yeah, the snow kind of cleaned
           e ve r yt h in g up--

           DEEJAY
           --except your mouth.
          Phil kisses the radio.

           PHIL
           I love those guys.

           RITA
           Are you always this jolly in the
           morning?
          Phil runs to the window and looks out.

          HIS POV - THE STREET
          The street ;is virtually empty, the town just waking up. Kids
          are throwing snowballs.

           PHIL
           No groundhog! Rita! They're all
           gone!

           RITA
           You must've had some dream.
          Phil stops, thinks.

          

           -1 1 9 -

          

           PHIL
           Did I just dream it?
          Phil opens the door and runs into the hallway wearing only
          pajama bottoms.

           RITA
           Phi l? Phil!
          Rita sits up in bed and waits. Suddenly, from somewhere else
          in the inn comes the sound of Phil at the piano expertly
          playing a difficult classical piece. He stops after a few
          bars.

           PHIL (O.C.)
           Yeah!!!!
          Phil runs back into the room.

           PHIL
           It really happened! You're
           really here!
          He pounces on Rita again.

           PHIL
           You're really actually here.

           RITA

           (LAUGHING)
           I'm here, I'm here!
          They kiss, passionately, hungrily.

           PHIL
           Let's go!
          He scoops her up in his arms.

           RITA
           Where're we going?

           PHIL
           Anywhere! Everywhere!

           CUT TO:

          

          INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LATER

          Phil and Rita, dressed now, enter and encounter Mrs. Lancaster
          Phil hugs her.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           Oh, my!

          

           -120-

          

           PHIL
           Florence! Say hello to Rita.
           She loves me.

           MRS. LANCASTER
           I'm not surprised.
          He kisses her on the cheek and rushes out with Rita.

          

          EXT. THE STREET - DAY

          Phil and Rita walk down Main Street hand in hand.

           A MAN
           Phil! Good morning!

           A LADY
           Mr. Connors. I wanted to thank
           you.

           PHIL
           That's all right. I--
          A FLORIST steps out of the flower shop with a bouquet.

           FLORIST
           Phil, here. I want you to have
           these.

           PHIL
           Thanks, Carl.
          Phil smells the flowers, and hands the bouquet to Rita.

           PHIL (V.O.)
           And so began my final lifetime,
           and ended the longest winter on
           record. I would find myself no
           longer able to affect the chain
           of events in this town, but I did
           learn something about time. You
           can waste time, you can kill
           time, you can do time, but if you
           use it wisely, there's never
           enough of it. So you'd better
           make the most of the time you've
           got.
          A car skids on the ice and smashes into a tree. Phil and Rita
          rush over to help, but the driver waves that he's okay. Rita
          and Phil continue their walk.

          

           -121-

          

           PHIL (V.O.)
           Larry never got through the
           blizzard, so none of my groundhog
           reports ever made it on the air.
           But Rita and I-- we lived happily
           ever after.
          Phil and Rita walk off together.
          Across the street, Larry is trying to get rid of Ned Ryerson
          who is doggedly trying to sell him insurance.

           NED
           But Phil told me you were his
           accountant!

           LARRY
           Look, I told you! He's nuts!
          Larry keeps trying to walk away, but Ned won't leave him alone.

           NED
           Let me just tell you about single
           premium life--
          Finally, Larry slugs Ned and storms off, leaving Ned
          floundering in a snowbank.
          Phil and Rita walk on as we pull up and away from Main Street
          revealing the whole of Punxsutawney and the snowy countryside
          that embraces it.

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          Very late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by
          a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO
          CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT

          PURSUIT.

          INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

          The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of
          two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish,
          has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face,
          despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out
          of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38.

                         RICK
          Pull over, man!

                         FRED
          No way, I can out-run 'em!

                         RICK
          No you can't--not in this thing!
          Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and

          JOINS THE CHASE.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Oh God, now there's two of 'em!

                         FRED
          I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til
          we get there!

                         RICK
          Are you crazy?!

                         FRED
          Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my
          wife!

          ESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT
          Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE
          followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see
          that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side
          of the mini-van.
          Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS
          spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach
          the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground.
          Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED.

                         RICK

          ON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early-
          20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK
          hams it up for the camera.

          RICK (O.S.)
          See the stud in the blue shorts?
          That's me the summer I got out of
          college.

          LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on
          either side of Rick.

                         RICK
          I still have a few.

                         GUNNAR
          Where?
          Rick shoots him a look.

                         RICK
          They're hidden.
          BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes
          up and puts her arms around Rick.

                         EMMA
          Who's that girl?

                         RICK
          That's Mommy.

                         EMMA
          No, I mean the young one standing
          next to you.

                         RICK
          That's Mommy.

                         EMMA
          Mommy used to have long hair? And
          she wore a bikini?

                         RICK

                         (WISTFULLY)
          Yes she did.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         EMMA
          How come she doesn't wear a bikini
          anymore?

                         GUNNAR
          Is it because of her fat ass?

                         RICK
          I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's
          got a fat ass?

                         GUNNAR
          Mommy.

          LONG BEAT.

                         RICK
          Well, uh, I don't appreciate that
          language, Gunnar. You've got the
          best mom in the whole world--don't
          ever say anything bad about her.
          Just then, MAGGIE comes GRUNTING into the room carrying a ONE-
          YEAR-OLD BABY in one arm and a basket of laundry in the
          other. She's in her late-30's, cute, with short, manageable
          mommy hair. She's wearing SWEATPANTS, an OVERSIZED T-SHIRT,
          and NO MAKE-UP.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey beautiful, you better get a
          move on--we're supposed to be
          meeting Fred and Grace soon.

                         MAGGIE
          I know, I know, I'm trying.

                         RICK
          Well how long you gonna be?

                         MAGGIE
          Forty-five minutes--sooner if you
          help with the kids.
          Maggie looks to him, hopeful.

                         RICK

                         (NONCHALANT)
          Forty-five minutes is good.
          Maggie shoots him a look and Rick smiles.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding. Okay, kids, first one
          in the tub gets college paid for.
          Emma and Gunnar just stare at him.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Come on, you bums, let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.
          As Rick starts to tickle his kids they run out of the room,

                         AND WE

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. SIDEWALK - EVENING

          Rick and Maggie walk along hand-in-hand. They're dressed-up
          and happy-looking.

                         RICK
          I miss going out with you on
          Saturday nights.
          She smiles at him.

                         MAGGIE
          I know, it's just like the old
          days.
          Rick pulls Maggie close as they walk.

                         RICK
          Maybe we should make a rule that we
          go out at least six nights a week
          without the kids.
          Maggie GIGGLES.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'm serious. We should go out every
          week--just you and me.
          A BEAUTIFUL BLONDE walks past them and Rick gives a QUICK
          GLANCE back AT HER ASS.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I think it'd be healthy.

                         MAGGIE
          You gotta be kidding me?
          Maggie pulls away.

                         RICK
          What?

                         MAGGIE
          You just checked out that girl's
          butt.

                         RICK
          I did?

                         MAGGIE
          Yeah, you did, and it's rude.

                         RICK
          Why? You think she saw me?

                         MAGGIE
          saw you.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.

                         RICK
          Oh, uh, yeah. I'm sorry, honey, I'm
          just kind of spacey today.

          GRACE (O.S.)
          Come on, we're late!
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Fred Searing and his wife GRACE, 38,
          waiting outside a restaurant. Fred sports a full-head of
          hair that's maybe a little too stiff. Grace is short and
          appealing in a Rachel Ray kind of way. Fred leans in to kiss
          Maggie as Rick kisses Grace.

                         MAGGIE
          Grace, let me ask you something:
          Does Fred ever check out other
          women in front of you?

                         GRACE
          No, Fred's not a gawker.
          Grace pats a pleased-looking Fred on the head.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Come on, Mags, let's go say hi to
          Dr. Lucy.
          We follow the women as they leave their husbands and ENTER
          the restaurant under a banner that says, 'Boston Psychiatric
          Association Person of the Year.'

          INT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

          Grace and Maggie approach the check-in table.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          There they are!
          ANOTHER ANGLE reveals DR. LUCY GILBERT, a very attractive and
          sophisticated-looking 40-year-old, holding court in the
          corner.

                         GRACE
          Dr. Lucy! Congratulations!

          DR. LUCY
          Girls, thank you so much for
          coming.
          Dr. Lucy speaks with a FRENCH ACCENT.

                         MAGGIE
          Are you kidding me? You're the only
          friend of ours who ever got an
          award--you think we're going to
          miss that?
          ANGLE ON Rick and Fred standing at the bar.

                         FRED
          Do you mind telling me how your
          wife catches you checking out
          another girl? What is this, amateur
          hour?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.
          The BARTENDER delivers a couple beers and Rick pays.

                         RICK
          The girl walked past and I glanced
          back at her for like half a second.

                         FRED
          There's your problem, dumb-ass--
          it's the wrong order. You don't
          wait for the girl to walk past and
          then glance back. You turn when
          she's still fifteen feet in front
          of you...then you wait for her to
          walk into your line of vision.
          Fred NOTICES an ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walking toward them from the
          right.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Observe.
          Before the woman reaches them, Fred turns to his left and
          holds the look until the Attractive Woman's ASS ENTERS HIS
          VIEW and he watches her walk away.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You see? I can't help it if her
          butt walks where I'm already
          looking.

                         RICK

                         (GETTING IT)
          It was your air space.

          WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
          Hey, guys.
          They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking
          past carrying several drinks. This is MISSY FRANKENFIELD,
          mid-30's.

          RICK AND FRED
          Hey, Missy.

                         MISSY
          (CALLING back to them)
          Don't forget to mingle!
          The guys watch Missy walk away.

                         FRED
          Wow. Missy's looking pretty good
          for someone going through a
          divorce.

                         RICK
          Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard
          they might have to sell the house.

                         FRED
          Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for
          the listing?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         RICK
          What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't
          go after the divorcee business
          unless they approach me first.

                         FRED
          Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh?
          As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's
          ass, we...
          REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping
          lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room.

                         GRACE
          Look at those two meatheads
          checking out Missy Frankenfield.
          What, do they think they're
          invisible over there?

                         MAGGIE
          I thought you said Fred wasn't a
          gawker.

                         GRACE
          He was standing right next to you.
          I can't let him know that I know--
          that would take all the fun out of
          it.

                         (CHUCKLES)
          You should see him. He's got some
          stupid move where he looks back
          before the girl passes to make it
          seem like he couldn't help but
          notice her ass. It's pathetic.
          Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE.

                          CUT TO:

          EXT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are
          getting out.

                         RICK
          How about I drive the babysitter
          home while you go upstairs and
          prepare the altar?
          He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front
          door.

                         MAGGIE
          I want to, honey, but I've got to
          get up early with the kids.

                         RICK
          I'll get up with the kids.

                         MAGGIE
          But I have to go out and buy a gift-
          -they're going to a birthday party
          tomorrow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         RICK
          I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take
          the kids to the park, then to the
          party. You can dust stay in bed,,
          get your beauty sleep, and bask in
          the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about
          to give you.

                         MAGGIE
          I love it when you sweet-talk me.
          Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN

          THEIR TRACKS.
          THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing
          there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar.

                         GUNNAR
          Mommy! Daddy!

                         RICK

                         (DEFLATED)
          Little buddy.. .what are you doing
          up?
          Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs
          apologetically to Rick.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          This is just a minor obstacle.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - NIGHT

          Rick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in
          the passenger seat. She is on the busty side.

                         RICK
          How were the kids tonight?

                         PAIGE
          Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute--
          all he wants to do is wrestle with
          me.
          Rick smiles at this.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn
          down the air--I'm a little chilly.
          Look--I got goose bumps.
          As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we
          RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are
          PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents.
          BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks
          away.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         RICK
          Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry.
          Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE
          ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE
          A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the
          steering wheel tight at ten-and-two.

                         PAIGE
          Thank you.

                         RICK
          'Welcome.

          EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT

          The mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house.

          INT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS

          Paige hesitates before getting out.

                         PAIGE
          Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?

                         RICK
          Sure.

                         PAIGE
          I was wondering...

                         (SQUINTS NERVOUSLY)
          .could you buy me some beer?
          Rick looks surprised.

                         RICK
          Buy you some.. .How old are you?

                         PAIGE
          Twenty. But I'm turning twenty-one
          next week.

                         RICK
          Oh. Happy birthday. That's a
          biggie.

                         PAIGE
          Yeah. My aunt usually buys beer for
          me, but she's out of town.

                         (SMILES HOPEFULLY)
          So. . .could ya?

                         RICK
          Uh, I don't know, Paige...I could
          get in a lot of trouble for giving
          alcohol to a minor.

                         PAIGE
          Oh, come on, I'm a junior in
          college. You drank when you were in
          college, didn't you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

                         RICK
          Well, uh...

                         PAIGE
          Besides, it's so arbitrary. How
          does it make sense that twenty's
          old enough to fight in Iraq or
          watch a porno movie, but it's too
          young to drink a beer?
          Rick shifts in his seat.

                         RICK
          Really? Twenty's old enough to
          uh...?

                         PAIGE
          Fight in Iraq?

                         RICK
          No, the other thing.

                         PAIGE
          Watch Porn? Oh, God yeah--half the
          girls in those things are my age.
          Rick catches a hint of cleavage, a flash of leg.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          Look, I promise no one's gonna find
          out. If you want, you can join me
          down at the lake--we'll listen to
          some tunes and have a couple beers.
          Rick stares at her, pictures it in his head. She looks
          hopeful, open.

                         RICK
          I'm sorry, Paige, I can't do that.

                         PAIGE
          Why not?

                         RICK
          Well... it would be.. .inappropriate.
          Rick's voice has taken on a firmer, more adult tone. Paige
          seems amused by it.

                         PAIGE
          What, is that your grown-up voice?

                         (SMILES)
          That would be inappropriate, Paige.

                         COME ON--

                         RICK
          No, Paige.
          (with an edge)
          What are you thinking? I'm a
          married man and I have a family.
          You think they'd like it if they
          knew I was hanging out at the lake,
          all alone, drinking beer with a
          college girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.
          She seems taken aback.

                         PAIGE

                         (PUT-OFF)
          I never said alone. My sorority's
          having a party down there tonight.
          Rick CLEARS HIS THROAT, tries to hide his embarrassment.

                         RICK
          All right, better get inside.
          She opens the car door, then glares back at him.

                         PAIGE
          Ewww. What the hell were you
          thinking?

                         RICK
          Go ahead. Scoot along now.
          As she SLAMS the car door, we...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Rick bounds up the stairs to find Maggie gently closing
          Gunnar's bedroom door.

                         MAGGIE
          Shhhh. He just fell asleep.

                         RICK
          Awesome.
          Rick playfully pinches Maggie's butt as he follows her into
          their bedroom where...

          INT. BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS

          .They find Emma sitting up in their bed, smiling.

                         EMMA
          Can I sleep with you tonight?

                         RICK
          No.

                         EMMA
          Please.

                         RICK
          No. Absolutely not.
          Maggie, clearly softening to the idea, shrugs at Rick.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Are you serious? Look, besides the
          other thing, I don't like the fact
          that my daughter needs someone to
          sleep with every night--that's not
          going to be good when she goes off
          to college, you know.
          Maggie rolls her eyes.

                         EMMA
          Well.. .can someone read me a story?
          Rick looks at Maggie, then at his daughter.

                         RICK
          Okay, one quick story. Come on,
          jump on my back.
          Emma jumps on Rick's back.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (TO MAGGIE)
          You can get started without me--
          I'll be right back.
          Rick piggybacks Emma out of the room.

          INT. EMMA'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

          Emma is putting Rick's HAIR INTO PONYTAILS.

                         RICK
          Okay, honey, this is the last pony
          and then night-night.
          Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him,
          satisfied.

                         EMMA
          There. You look pretty, Daddy.

                         RICK
          Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and
          go to sleep.
          She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on
          both cheeks.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I love you, Emma.

                         EMMA
          I love you, too, Daddy.

          EXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          Rick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom,
          closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY.

                          F

          INT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Rick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.
          HIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP.

                         RICK
          No. Please, no.
          Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep,
          so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS.
          As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the
          b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She
          listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge
          of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER
          EYES AGAIN, and we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARK - MORNING

          Rick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred
          APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS
          COURTS in the b.g.)

                         FRED
          Hey.

                         RICK
          Hey. How'd you make out?

                         FRED
          Great. Lost both sets.

                         RICK
          So'd you get the business?
          Fred nods and wipes his brow.

                         FRED
          Pretty sure I got the Auto and
          Home. He told me to call his
          accountant on Monday about the
          Life.

                         RICK
          Nice.
          Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with
          their CHILDREN.

                         FRED
          Can you believe the talent here
          today?

                         RICK

                         (PAINED)
          Yeah. I know.
          They NOTICE something O.S..
          THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING
          HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon.

                         FRED
          Ouch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.
          Rick SIGHS.

                         RICK
          CPR girl's back, too.
          Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING
          A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly.

                         FRED
          Imagine if we were coming here back
          when we were single?

                         RICK

                         (FALSE BRAVADO)
          Oh baby, the damage we would do.

                         EMMA
          Monkey bars!
          The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym.

                         GUNNAR
          Me first!
          Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor
          scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep
          past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and

          WEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS.

                         FRED
          So you get lucky last night?

                         RICK
          Nah, the kids were up when we got
          home. How 'bout you?

                         FRED
          Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked
          right out so I snuck out to the car
          and rubbed one out.
          Rick shoots Fred a look.

                         RICK
          The car? What are you Knight Rider?
          Why didn't you just go in the
          bathroom like a normal guy?

                         FRED
          And get caught by Grace? Can't risk
          it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's
          where I lost my virginity. And
          they're comfy--I just put the seat
          back and turn on the tunes.
          The guys sit on a bench.

                         RICK
          That's one of the things they don't
          tell you when you're young--that
          you'll still be jerking-off after
          you get married. I thought it was
          dust gonna be a teenage thing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         15

                         FRED
          Yeah, I didn't see that one coming.
          The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee
          Girls play all around them.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You know what I miss the most?

                         RICK
          What?

                         FRED
          The arch.

                         RICK
          What arch?

                         FRED
          You know when you're taking a
          girl's panties off for the first
          time, and you're wondering if she's
          going to stop you, but then she
          gives you that little pelvic arch-
          thrust that tells you that the
          struggle's over, everything's going
          to be okay?
          Rick SIGHS.

                         RICK
          That's a happy moment.

                         FRED
          Yep. Another thing gone forever.
          Rick looks at his watch.

                         RICK
          I should get going, I have to drop
          the kids off at a birthday party.

                         FRED
          You want to grab a coffee after?

                         CUT TO:

           ESTABLISHING SHOT - COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT MORNING

          INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME

          Fred and Rick stand in line.

                         RICK
          Do you have any interest in going
          down to the Patriot's training camp
          one of these days?

                         FRED
          Are you kidding, I'd love that.
          Except...I always feel kind of
          pathetic waiting in line for Tom
          Brady's autograph.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         RICK
          Fred, I was planning on bringing
          the kids.

                         FRED
          Genius! That's the perfect cover!
          Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S.

                         RICK
          Uh-oh...
          HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her
          straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her
          white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a
          tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23,
          granola, fresh, Australian, spacey.
          BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe.

                         FRED
          Did you see her face? Her face is
          tremendous.

                         RICK
          (chanting, scared)
          Please don't have a nice ass,
          please don't have a nice ass...
          But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS
          IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed.

                         RICK (CONT'D
          Oh, come on! That's ri iculous.

                         FRED
          I know. She's from Australia. Been
          working here about a month.

                         RICK
          Why'd you have to bring me here?!

                         FRED
          Okay, cool it, tiger--here she
          comes.
          Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred.

                         COFFEE GIRL

                         (AUSTRALIAN ACCENT)
          Iced coffee with two Splendas
          again?
          Fred wants to say yes, but just nods.

          COFFEE GIRL (CONT'D)
          How about your mate there?

                         RICK

                         (STUNNED)
          Uh...same.
          Her smile comes with a squint, which makes her eyes sparkle.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.
          ANOTHER ANGLE reveals a WANNABE ARTIST-TYPE MALE EMPLOYEE,
          mid-20's (clearly covetous of Coffee Girl) sizing Rick and
          Fred up as he wipes down a counter.

          BACK ON COFFEE GIRL AND OUR GUYS

                         COFFEE GIRL
          (re: Rick's shirt)
          Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin
          with that?

                         RICK
          Uh, sure. What do you recommend?

                         COFFEE GIRL
          They're all good.
          The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee
          Girl.

                         WANNABE
          I'd go with the bran muffin--you
          guys are probably having digestive
          issues at your age, right?
          Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl.

                         RICK
          I'll have a blueberry muffin
          please.

                         FRED
          Make it a bran muffin for me.
          Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl
          turns to get their order, we go to...

          SAME SCENE - A FEW MINUTES LATER
          Rick and Fred, now with coffees, sit at the rear of the shop.

                         RICK
          Did you notice she's from Cleavage,
          Ohio?

                         FRED
          Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a
          couple of pepperoni slices.
          Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS

          INTENSELY.

                         RICK
          What the hell are you doing?

                         FRED
          Shh. I'm taking a mental photograph
          for my spank bank.

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          Say cheese.

          ED (O.S.)
          Jesus Christ, guys, give it a rest.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.
          Rick and Fred turn to see ED LONG, tall, good-looking, mid-
          40's, standing at the creamer counter behind them.

                         RICK
          Oh, hey, Ed. Didn't see you there.

                         ED
          That's because you were shooting
          laser beams at the java babe.

                         RICK
          Well, no, we were just--

                         ED
          Come on, gentlemen, you're married
          men and she's half your age--grow

                         P-
          The guys can't muster a response.

                          ED (CONT'D)
          So I guess I'll be seeing you at
          the house-warming party this
          weekend.

                         RICK
          Hm?

                         ED
          This Saturday afternoon at the new
          casa--we're inally in and we're
          having a little celebration.

                         RICK
          Oh, I don't know if we can--

                         ED
          Your wives already RSVP'd.

                         RICK
          Right on.

                         ED
          'Til then.
          Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them.

                          ED (CONT'D)
           Come on, pound the potato.
          Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns TAPPING Ed's fist with
          theirs. Then Ed leaves.

                         FRED

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          What a d-bag.

                         RICK
          He's right though.
          Fred looks at Rick.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          What are we doing sitting here
          gawking at her for? We're married
          men--it's creepy.

                         FRED
          I don't see what the big deal is--
          we're not hurting anyone. What is
          he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me
          what I can look at now? For God
          sakes, don't take that away from me-
          -it's all I got!
          As Rick thinks about this, we...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON A BABY MONITOR - PULL BACK to reveal that it's in
          the middle of a POKER TABLE next to a pile of ONE-DOLLAR
          BILLS. Sitting around the table PLAYING LIAR'S POKER are
          Rick, Fred, GARY, HOG-HEAD, BAKER, and FLATS, all in their
          mid-30's to mid-40's. Hog-head has a huge melon, Baker is
          husky, Flats is a pale red-head, and Gary is slight and
          squirrelly.

                         BAKER
          Rick, you open.
          Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him
          and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS.

                         RICK
          Four 9's.

                         FRED
          Hey, where's Coakley? How come he
          didn't show?

                         GARY
          Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals.
          The guys nod their approval.

                         BAKER
          Man, imagine being Coakley? The
          guy's single, he's loaded, chicks
          love him, he doesn't have to answer
          to anybody.

                         GARY
          That's the life.

                         FRED
          That is the life.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Let me ask you something: What
          would you guys pay to have your way
          with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an
          entire weekend?
          The guys perk up as they think about this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          You get to pick any one you want--
          and you know up front that you
          won't get her pregnant, no
          diseases, you're never gonna hear
          from her again, and your wife will
          never find out.

                         GARY
          How's it possible to know that my
          wife won't find out?

                         HOG-HEAD

                         (ANNOYED)
          It's not. I'm saying if it were
          possible, like if I was a magic
          genie and I could grant you this
          wish but then make it like it never
          even happened.

                         FLATS
          But would I still have memory of
          it?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Oh yeah. Great memories.

                         GARY
          Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for
          that.
          Baker shoots him a look.

                         BAKER
          You cheap,bastard. We're talking
          about an investment that gets your
          rocks off and protects your wife's
          feelings. I'd pay five grand.

                         RICK
          Wow.

                         GARY
          Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street,
          but us public school teachers
          aren't getting any of that bail-out
          money you're over-tipping everyone
          with.
          Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS.

                         MAGGIE
          Hey, guys.

                         RICK
          Oh, hey, honey. How was the book
          club?

                         MAGGIE
          Great.

                         FRED
          What did you guys read this month?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         MAGGIE
          Hemingway.

                         GARY
          Old Man and the Sea?

                         MAGGIE
          No, Muriel's yoga book.
          The guys LAUGH.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Actually, we were supposed to be
          discussing The Sun Also Rises but
          Grace pulled out a bottle of
          tequila and that was the end of
          that. So, did the kids go down
          easy?

                         RICK
          Gunnar and Emma stalled for a
          while, but they weren't bad.

                         MAGGIE
          How about the baby?
          Rick points to the BABY MONITOR in the middle of the table.

                         RICK
          Not a peep.

                         MAGGIE
          Great job. Now win some money,
          honey.
          She kisses Rick and walks out of the room.

                         GARY
          I wish I could drink tequila. It's
          a great buzz but it always gives me
          the spins and then I have to go
          home early.

                         FRED
          You want to know a sure cure for
          the spins?
          Fred puts a hand over his right eye.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Just cover up one eye. It balances
          out the equilibrium.

                         RICK
          Or you could find a nice 12-step
          program.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

          INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          As Maggie gets to the top of the stairs, she can hear the
          O.S. SOUND OF THE BABY CRYING. She walks down the hall,
          opens the Baby's door and REACTS.
          HER POV - the exhausted and sweaty Baby is standing in his
          crib, SOBBING. The baby monitor is on the dresser next to
          the crib BLARING out LAUGHTER from the poker game.

          INT. BABY NURSERY - CONTINUOUS


                         MAGGIE
          Oh, you poor thing...
          She hurries to the Baby and PICKS HIM UP.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Silly Daddy... he got the monitors
          mixed-up. Have you been listening
          to those loud-mouths all night?
          As Maggie moves to turn off the monitor, we HEAR:

          FLATS (O.S.)
          .So how 'bout you, Fred--how much
          would you pay to s end an entire
          weekend with one of the hottest
          women in the world?
          Maggie hesitates and LISTENS IN.

          FRED (O.S.)
          I wouldn't have to pay--I'm married
          to her.
          There's a BEAT, then the guys EXPLODE IN LAUGHTER.

          FRED (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          No, seriously, I'd pay five grand,
          easy.
          Maggie's JAW DROPS.

          BACK ON POKER GAME

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          I'd have to figure out a way to get
          it out of the bank without Grace
          noticing, but I suppose the genie
          could help me with that.

                         HOG-HEAD
          You could put me down for seven-
          five.

                         BAKER
          Pfttt. Hog-head, your ass doesn't
          have seven-five.
          More LAUGHTER from the guys as Rick deals out fresh bills.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

                         FLATS
          So what's your number, Rick?

                         RICK
          Oh jeez, Flats, I don't know...

                         FRED
          Come on.. any girl you choose. You
          get to do anything you want with
          her, and your wife will never find
          out. It's completely harmless, a
          one-time thing--what would you pay
          for that?
          BACK ON MAGGIE as she cradles her baby and LEANS CLOSER to
          the monitor.

          RICK (O.S.)
          I honestly don't know, fellas.

          BAKER (O.S.)
          Ballpark.
          PUSH IN ON MAGGIE as she waits nervously for her husband's
          answer.

          RICK (O.S.)
          Well... I've got a great wife and I
          sure wouldn't want to hurt her
          feelings, so...
          Maggie SMILES at this. That's my guy!

          RICK (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          I guess the real question is,
          what wouldn't I pay?!
          The guys LAUGH O.S. and MAGGIE REACTS, as we...

                         CUT TO:

          INT. MAGGIE AND RICK'S KITCHEN - LATER

          Maggie's got Rick backed into a corner.

                         MAGGIE
          What wouldn't you pay?!

                         RICK
          I didn't really mean it, honey.
          (scared, defenseless)
          They kind of put me on the spot.
          Look, some of the other guys were
          throwing out some pretty hefty
          bids.

                         MAGGIE
          What does that have to do with
          anything?

                         RICK
          Well... I'm the host of the party, I
          didn't want to be a buzz-kill.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         24
          Maggie squints, appalled.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Look, all I was saying was, there's
          no amount of money I wouldn't pay
          to protect you and the kids.

                         MAGGIE
          How is having sex with a hooker
          protecting me and the kids?

                         RICK
          No one said anything about hookers.

                         MAGGIE
          You were paying for sex--what would
          you call her?

                         RICK

                         (WEAKLY)
          Well.. .the genie was getting the
          dough, not her.

                         (RECOVERING)
          Come on, be reasonable, it was just
          guy-talk--it's not like it could
          really happen.
          Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Love you!

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

          Maggie, Grace, and Dr. Lucy eat at an upscale restaurant.
          Dr. Lucy listens quietly to the women.

                         GRACE
          Fred said five grand? What a
          blowhard!

                         MAGGIE
          You know what's even funnier? Hog-
          head McCormick said he'd pay seven
          grand.

                         GRACE
          What?! That bum hasn't worked since
          the dot-com bust--his wife supports
          him!
          The girls LAUGH.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Well, look on the bright side: At
          least they're not cheating on us.

                         MAGGIE
          Sometimes I wonder if it would be
          better if they did cheat and get it
          over with.

          You mean, rather than take the slow
          boat to resentment?
          The girls look to Dr. Lucy.

          DR. LUCY (CONT'D
          I'm just saying.. .maybe a little
          freedom would be good for them. And
          for you.

                         GRACE
          A what?

          DR. LUCY
          A hall pass. A week off from
          marriage.
          Grace and Maggie stop chewing.

                         MAGGIE
          Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let
          them go out and cheat?

          DR. LUCY
          I'm saying give them a week off
          from marriage.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, most married men have foggy
          memories of their single days and
          they somehow get under the
          impression that if not for you,
          they'd be able to be with ail those
          women who entice them.

                         GRACE
          That's Fred. He thinks because he
          sees big tits everywhere and then
          still comes home for dinner that I
          should be welcoming him at the door
          like some conquering hero.
          Dr. Lucy smiles.

          DR. LUCY
          Well, maybe it's time to let them
          go out there and find out what it's
          really like.

                         MAGGIE
          Wow. You're talking about the
          nuclear option.
          Maggie ponders the idea.

                         GRACE
          And remind me again, what good
          could possibly come from this...?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

          DR. LUCY
          There's a wonderful principle in
          psychology called 'reactance
          theory.' It basically states that
          if you're constantly told you can't
          do something, you want to do it
          more than ever. And conversely, if
          you remove the taboo, you remove
          the obsession.
          Grace makes a 't' sound.

                         GRACE

                         (SARCASTIC)
          I got an idea, Doc: Why don't you
          try a hall pass out on your husband
          and let us know how it works out.

          DR. LUCY
          Oh, I have.
          Grace and Maggie REACT to this.

                         MAGGIE
          You're telling us you let Charlie
          sleep with another woman?
          Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering.

          DR. LUCY
          I am not telling you that. I am
          telling you that I gave him the
          freedom to choose for himself.

                         GRACE
          And...?

          DR. LUCY
          All I know is...our marriage is
          better than ever.
          Grace and Maggie think about this.

                         GRACE
          I don't know. There's a reason that
          men evolved and apes didn't. It's
          because women demanded more.
          Without a wife, Einstein would've
          been humping a maple tree all day.

          EXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - DAY

          There are several flashy cars out front of this huge
          McMansion. As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of
          Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet
          them. (Ed's 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and a
          Polo shirt, just like his father.)

                         GRACE
          There he is! The lord of the manor!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.

                         ED
          Come on, everyone in the shack! The
          grand tour's about to begin!

          INT. STUDY - AFTERNOON

          Ed and his wife KIMMY (late-30's, high-maintenance) lead
           Rick, Fred, Maggie, Grace, and SEVERAL OTHER GUESTS into a
          large wood-paneled study. (The Long's 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER
           sticks to her mother's side WEARING A MATCHING DRESS.)

                          ED
          I call it headquarters.
          LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife,
          MANDY, (who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT) look around in awe.

                         MANDY
          Un-believable.

                         ED
          That's sweet of you to say, Mandy.

                         LARRY
          It's epic, Ed.
          Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR.

                         ED

                         (RE: HUMIDOR)
          And this over here--this is the war
          room. The temperature in there
          never goes above fifty-four
          degrees, never below fifty-three. I
          even threw in a back-up generator
          in case we lose power and the main
          generator doesn't kick in. Now who
          wants a Cubano? They're the real
          deal--Coakley snagged them on his
          trip to Havana.

                         KIMMY
          Wait a second, Ed, first I want to
          show them Lny headquarters.
          Fred looks at Rick and rolls his eyes.

          INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          It looks like a Waterworks showroom. Despite its bloated
          opulence, Grace and Maggie can't help but be impressed.

                         KIMMY
          It's my paradise.

                         ED
          With a price tag north of one
          hundred and forty large, it better
          be paradise.
          Ed holds out his fist and Rick obediently POUNDS IT. Just
          then Grace NOTICES that Fred has disappeared.

                         GRACE
          Hey, where did Fred go?
          Rick turns and sees that he's missing.

          INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE UPSTAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

          Rick walks down a hall and finds Fred in a guest room
          watching a baseball game on TV.

                         RICK
          What are you doing?

                         FRED
          I can't take these look-at-how-much-
          I-own parties. It's obnoxious.
          Rick nods and sits down beside him.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          When I bought my completely-loaded
          Honda Odyssey, I didn't go around
          bragging about it, did I?

                         RICK
          Well, kind of. You made me drive
          around town with you for two hours,
          remember?

                         FRED

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          I thought you'd want to watch a
          movie in a mini-van. You never got
          to watch a movie in a mini-van
          before, did you?
          Rick shrugs.

                         RICK
          Why'd you have to hook your boat up
          to it?

                         FRED
          Because it's the Touring Edition,
          numb-skull. The thing can tow more
          weight than ninety percent of the
          pick-ups out there!

          INT. MASTER BEDROOM - SAME

          Everybody is admiring the antique fireplace.

                         KIMMY
          The mantle actually came all the
          way from Tuscany, which is in
          Europe.

                         ED
          Hey, gang, check this out.

          Oh God, Eddie, they don't need to
          see that--they'll think we're
          wackos.
          Ed PUNCHES A CODE into a keypad and the WALL SLIDES OPEN
          revealing a SAFE ROOM.

          INT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

          Maggie, Grace, and the others follow Ed into a safe room
          filled with VIDEO MONITORS surveilling all the rooms in the
          house. When Kimmy ENTERS she pushes a button CLOSING THE

          WALL BEHIND THEM.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh my God... this is like secret
          agent stuff.

                         KIMMY
          I think having a safe room is a bit
          over the top, but Ed feels with our
          two little ones you can never be
          too cautious.

                         GRACE
          Aw, you're such a good daddy.

                         MAGGIE
          (aside to Grace)
          Rick can't even set up the baby
          monitors right.
          Ed points to a monitor where we see Rick and Fred ENTER the
          master bedroom.

                         ED

          the master bathroom doorway and look in.

          .All I'm saying is, who gets a
          mini-van when you don't even have
          any kids?

          FRED (ON MONITOR)
          You don't know much about the
          insurance game, do you, Rick? When
          you pull into a person's driveway
          to sell them life insurance, who do
          you think they'd rather see? A hot-
          shot in a Porsche or a family man
          in a mini-van? Hm?
          Rick looks around the empty room.

          RICK (ON MONITOR)
          Hey, where'd everyone go?

                         (BRITISH ACCENT)
          Thanks for coming to the war room,
          old chap. By the way, did I mention
          that my wife's vagina never goes
          above fifty-four degrees, nor below
          fifty-three.

          stands across from him rubbing her temples. It looks like
          the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her
          little boy for sneaking a frog into the house.

                         MAGGIE
          You know what really troubles me?
          The thing that you're all so
          obsessed with is meaningless to
          you. It's really just about numbers
          with you guys.
          Rick looks up, confused.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Rick, you can't even tel me the
          month you lost your virginity. I
          can tell you the exact day and hour
          that I lost mine.
          Rick seems a little embarrassed by this.

                         RICK
          Well, virginity is different for
          guys.

                         MAGGIE
          The point is, obviously I like sex,
          too--it means something to me--but
          I don't walk around gawking at
          every guy I see.

                         RICK
          All right, so I occasionally notice
          other women. I'm sorry.

          clean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         RICK
          Okay, you want the truth? You
          really want me to pull back the
          curtain here? From the moment I
          leave the house in the morning 'til
          the moment I get home, I pretty
          much notice every woman in my path.
          Maggie turns to face him.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          But it's not how you think it is,
          Mags. It's like... it's like a
          curse. I don't want to notice, but
          I can't help it. It's always been
          like that. I figured that when I
          c jot married that would be it, but
          it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give
          two shits about marriage.

                         MAGGIE

                         (HURT)
          So what are you saying--you're not
          happy with our sex life?
          Rick reaches up and takes her hand.

                         RICK
          No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our
          sex life is great--not that I
          wouldn't mind a little more, but--
          look, one thing has nothing to do
          with the other. I think about sex a
          lot--all guys do--that's just the
          way it is.
          Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope.
          No one speaks for a few moments. Then:

                         MAGGIE
          I'm giving you a hall pass.

                         RICK
          A what?

                         MAGGIE
          One week off from marriage.

                         RICK
          You mean, like a trial separation?
          You are seriously overreacting.

                         MAGGIE
          It's not a separation, it's a hall
          pass. You can do whatever you want.
          Get it out of your system.

                         RICK

                         (BEAT)
          Wait a minute--are you for real?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         MAGGIE
          It's not a yes or no offer, and
          it's not a debate. You're getting a
          hall pass.
          As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING

          Maggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick ENTERS
          dressed for work. We hear the O.S. SOUNDS of The Wiggles
          coming from a TV in another room.

                         RICK
          'Morning.

                         MAGGIE
          (not facing him)
          There's a couple hard-boiled eggs
          in a bowl there for you.

                         RICK
          I'm gonna have to take them to go,
          hon, I've got a showing in fifteen
          minutes.
          Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and
          kisses her on the cheek.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey, about this hall pass
          business.. .1 don't want it and I
          don't need it. All I need is--

                         MAGGIE
          I told you, this isn't negotiable.
          She turns and faces him.

                         RICK
          You're really serious about this?

                         MAGGIE
          Rick, this isn't something that
          I...look, I really think you need
          this. I think we need this.
          Rick doesn't know what to say.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          This afternoon I'm taking the kids
          out to my parent's beach house.
          Rick REACTS to this.

                         RICK
          For how long?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.

                         MAGGIE
          We'll be back in one week. And as
          far as I'm concerned, starting
          right now. .. you have the week off
          from marriage.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY

          This is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in
          his mini-van and gets out. He walks past a Coldwell Banker
          For Sale sign with Rick's name on it.

          INT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - SAME

          Rick is showing the kitchen to a COUPLE, mid-40's, when Fred

          ENTERS.

                         RICK
          Hey, what are you doing here?

                         FRED
          I called your office and they told
          me you were in the neighborhood.
          Rick turns to the couple.

                         RICK
          Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred
          Searing. Fred, this is Harold and
          Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up
          here from Long Island.

                         FRED
          Well, mazel tov, folks.
          The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a
          card.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Here, let me give you my card.
          Home, auto, or life insurance--I'm
          the go-to mensch in town.

                         HAROLD GOLDBERG
          We're good on insurance.
          Rick quickly jumps in.

                         RICK
          (to the Goldbergs)
          Uh, why don't you two take another
          look around and if you have any
          questions I'll be right here.

                         HAROLD GOLDBERG
          Thank you.
          The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         RICK

                         (HUSHED)
          What the he 1 are you doing--I'm
          trying to make a sale here.

                         FRED
          You weren't picking up your cell--I
          wanted to see how much trouble you
          got in last night. You know what
          Grace made me do? She made me call
          the Longs and apologize.
          Rick flinches.

                         RICK
          Oof .

                         FRED
          How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out
          when you got home?

                         RICK
          Uh... sort of.
          Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's
          aren't listening. Then:

                          RICK (CONT'D)
          She gave me a hall pass.

                         FRED
          A what?

                         RICK
          A week off from marriage to do
          whatever I want. She's going to her
          parents' house down the Cape 'til
          next Sunday.
          Fred SNICKERS.

                         FRED
          Yeah, right.

                         RICK
          I'm serious.

                         FRED
          You're full of shit.

                         RICK
          Fred, it's true. You think I could
          make something like this up?
          Fred stares at him.

                         FRED
          I don't get it--why aren't you more
          excited?

                         RICK
          Well...I don't know how I feel.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

                         FRED
          About...?

                         RICK
          The hall pass. Something about it
          isn't right.

                         FRED
          You mean, like, you think Maggie
          might have a brain tumor or
          something?

                         RICK
          No. I mean, just because my wife
          tells me it's okay to cheat... is
          it?

                         FRED
          Uh, yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          Why can't you just accept the fact
          that your wife is a goddamn saint,
          Rick? She's evolved. Don't you see?
          She gets it!

                         RICK
          Yeah, but there's a part of me
          that's saying, 'Wow, you must have
          pushed her pretty hard to get her
          to this point.' And is that good
          for a marriage? That your wife is
          willing to try something this
          insane?
          Fred can't believe his ears.

                         FRED
          Absolutely!

                         (BEAT)
          Come on, doesn't it bother you that
          our wives dreams all come true, but
          ours don't? Look at Maggie; when
          she was a kid she played house--you
          g a ve her a house. She played with
          her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a
          Viking. She played mommy--you made
          her a mommy.

                         RICK
          The oven's a GE.

                         FRED
          It's a real gas oven! And what
          about you, huh? Come on, man, your
          wife is living her dreams.. .and now
          it's time for you to live yours.
          As Rick thinks about this, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          Fred and Grace climb the stairs at the end of the day.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         FRED
          I don't know, I think this is some
          very forward-thinking on Maggie's
          part.

                         GRACE
          Quit lobbying--you're not getting a
          hall pass. And you mark my words,
          this is going to end up biting
          Maggie in the ass.
          At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her.

                         FRED
          Why would I need a hall pass? I've
          got you.

                         GRACE
          Not tonight you don't. I'm too
          bloated and I have cramps.

                         FRED
          I don't mind.

                         GRACE
          Fred, do I have to spell it out for
          you? I'm having my period.

                         FRED

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          Yeah, I got that.
          He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away.

                         GRACE
          Come on, hon, give me a break. Not
          tonight.
          Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom.

                         FRED

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Oh, shit--I forgot to take the
          trash out.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Fred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home.
           We HEAR Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car
          and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're...
          LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting
          in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is
          slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC.
          A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later
          BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED.
          As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to
          figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred
          continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          Officer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM
          FRAME and then REAPPEARS at Fred's driver's side window. Now
          only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE

          CAR.
          The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred
          continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs
          out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES
          IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each
          other with a NOW-WE'VE-SEEN-IT-ALL EXPRESSION, we...

                         CUT TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have
          gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on.
          PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred
          standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a
          furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.)

                         OFFICER #1
          All right, ma'am, if you say he's
          yours.. .you can have him.
          The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS.

                         GRACE
          Thank you, officers.
          Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the
          door shuts, we HEAR:

          GRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

          WHAT KIND OF SICK PRICK JERKS OFF

          IN HIS OWN FRONT YARD?!
          As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go...
          CLOSE ON a smiling Fred.

                         FRED
           I got a Hall Pass!

          INT. RICK'S OFFICE - DAY

          Rick is at his desk staring at a giddy Fred.

                         RICK
          How?

                         FRED
          Doesn't matter how. I got one. Can
          you believe it?! I got a hall pass!
          Rick stands up, elated.

                         RICK
          And I've got a hall pass!

                         FRED
          We both have hall passes!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         RICK
          When does yours start?
          Fred looks at his watch.

                         FRED
          Twenty-three minutes ago! She just
          left for the Cape--she's staying
          with Maggie. It's just you and me
          for the next six days!

                         RICK
          Oh my God, do you realize how much
          easier this is going to make it--
          having a hall pass partner?

                         FRED
          And it's not just me--Baker, Gary,
          and Hog-head are coming out with us
          tonight!

                         RICK
          No way?! They got hall passes,
          too?!

                         FRED
          No, no, no--they just want to
          watch.
          Rick grows concerned.

                         RICK
          You think that's a good idea,
          letting them in on it? What if they
          blab and it gets around town--it
          might embarrass our wives.

                         FRED
          Don't worry, I already talked to
          them. Their lips are sealed.
          Rick and Fred smile.

                          DAY 1

          EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Rick, Fred, and their MIDDLE-AGED POSSE (Baker, Hog-head &
           Gary) walk across a boulevard like rock stars. (Think of the
          SLO-MO shots from Swingers or Reservoir Dogs.) Nobody
          smiles, they're all business as they hit the sidewalk and
          march straight into ...APPLEBEE'S.

          INT. APPLEBEE'S - MOMENTS LATER

          They step up to the bar.

          Five MGD's, my friend.
          While waiting for the beers, the guys CHECK OUT THE SCENE.
          It's mostly FAMILIES, a few YOUNG COUPLES.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          The guy at the Holiday Inn Express
          told me this place really kicks in
          around nine-thirty.

                         BAKER
          Hey, why are you staying at a hotel
          if your wives are out of town?

                         FRED
          Well, we can't very well take babes
          back to our places--if they know
          where we live they might end up
          stalking us.

                         RICK
          Besides, I wouldn't be able to
          concentrate with all the pictures
          everywhere and the kids' cut-outs
          all over the fridge.

                         GARY
          Yeah, isn't it weird how your own
          kids can creep you out sometimes?
          Rick shoots Gary a look.

                         FRED
          I get the feeling there's a lot of
          divorcees in this place.

                         HOG-HEAD
          That's good. Divorcees are into
          kinky sex--that's why they're
          divorced.
          Just then the BARTENDER arrives with the Miller Genuine
          Drafts and the guys CLINK BOTTLES.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          So come on, point out which girls
          you guys are gonna do tonight.
          Gary elbows Fred as he spots TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN at the end
          of the bar.

                         GARY
          What about those two? Why don't you
          bang them?

                         FRED
          No way. They're doing the

                         SWEATSHIRT-AROUND-THE-WAIST THING--
          they're obviously hiding something
          back there.

                         GARY
          Okay, how about the blonde hostess?
          Maybe somebody should nail her,
          huh?

                         RICK
          Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got
          a whole week.
          Baker looks around at the lame bar scene.

                         BAKER
          Are you guys sure that Applebee's
          is the best place to be picking up
          women?

          What are you thinking--Olive
          Garden?

                         GARY
          Nah, that's only good on Thursday
          nights.

          Hey, what about the auto show?
          Baker shoots them a look.

                         BAKER
          Are you guys for real?

                         GARY
          Wait a second--where's Coakley?
          That's where we should be.

                         BAKER
          He's in Iceland.

          What's he doing there?

          The guys all nod at this, proud of him.

          Look, before we go bagging any
          chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef
          in me.

                         GARY
          Hey, I got a guy over at Outback
          Steak House who could set us up.

                         BAKER
          Ooooh, he's got pull over at
          Outback. Wow.

          As the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary.

          Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have
          any connections at 7/11, do ya?
          Maybe someone could hook me up with
          a player's card so I can cut right
          to the front of the raspberry

           Grace stands at the window staring out on the ocean, while
           Maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel. The kids
           are asleep and the place is quiet.

                         GRACE
          I think we might've made a huge
          mistake.

                         MAGGIE
          Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why
          don t you just try to get some
          sleep?
          Grace turns to Maggie.

                         GRACE
          Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't
          understand you--how can you Just
          sit there and read knowing that
          Rick could be making out with a
          supermodel right now?
          Maggie doesn't answer.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Our husbands aren't married this
          week. Do you know what husbands do
          when they're not married?

                         MAGGIE
          Shh. You're going to wake the kids.

                         GRACE
          Are you going to sit there and tell
          me you're not the least bit
          concerned about what they're doing
          right now?
          Maggie SIGHS.

                         MAGGIE
          Okay... I'm a little concerned.

          Grace flops into the chair across from her.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Of course I'm concerned. But what
          choice did we have?

                         GRACE
          We could've kept the status quo. I
          mean, were things really that bad
          that we had to try something this
          extreme?

                         MAGGIE
          For me they were.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, you may call this a hall
          pass, but for me it's more of a
          Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I
          don't know what else to do.
          Grace looks at Maggie, surprised.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Remember last week when we went to
          Lucy's award thing?
          Grace nods.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          That night when we got home, Rick
          and I were gonna.. .you know... and I
          was waiting for him in bed while he
          tucked the kids in, and I started
          wondering who he would be thinking
          about during sex. Would it be the
          girl he checked out on the way into
          the party? Or would it be Missy
          Frankenfield--because I noticed him
          gawking at her? Or how about one of
          the waitresses, or maybe somebody
          he saw at work that day? Then when
          he came into the room, I did
          something I'd never done before: I
          pretended to be asleep.

                         GRACE
          You're kidding me? You've never
          done that? I do that all the time!
          Maggie almost smiles.

                         MAGGIE
          Look, I understand that people have
          fantasies and that you're not
          always thinking about the person
          you're with.

                         GRACE
          That's for sure.

                         MAGGIE
          But it's just...I don't know... it's
          been too long since I felt that he
          was thinking about me.

          They sit there for a moment, quiet. Then:

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          I need this hall pass to work,
          Grace, because if it doesn't, I

                         FRED
          Plus it wouldn't hurt to work up a
          little sweat--get those pheromones
          flying.
          Just then, two sexy BEER-CART GIRLS wave as they pass.

                          HOG-HEAD
          You talked me into it.

                         GARY
          Hey, guys, look what I brought.
          Gary holds up a ZIPLOCK BAG full of something chocolatey.

                         RICK
          What's that?

                         GARY
          Pot brownskies.
          The guys all look at one another, baffled.

                         RICK
          What, are we on spring break? Where
          the hell'd you get those?

                         GARY
          I got an in.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         FRED
          With who?

                         GARY
          Guy who washes my dog. Go ahead.
          He holds out the bag and the guys hesitate.

                         GARY (CONT'D)
          Eating it isn't like smoking it.
          It's a much mellower buzz--you'll
          just feel relaxed.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Are they chocolatey?
          As Hog-Head SNIFFS the brownies, Rick takes a practice swing.

                         RICK
          Hog-head, come on, who eats pot
          brownies at eleven in the morning
          when they're playing golf?

                         HOG-HEAD
          John Daly?

                         GARY
          And by the way, Rick, this is
          spring break! You've got a hall
          pass! Live it up, man! It'll
          probably help your rap with the
          ladies later.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Gary's right--when are we ever
          gonna get the chance to do pot
          brownies again?
          Hog-Head takes a brownie and BITES INTO IT.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          Mmm. These are yummy.

                         RICK
          You don't even have a hall pass.

                         HOG-HEAD
          So? I can still live vicariously
          through you guys, can't I?

                         RICK
          It's not vicarious if you're
          actually doing it.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Whatever. Just hit your ball.
          Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE.

                         FRED
          Oh, what the hell, it's not like my
          game can get any worse.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.
          Rick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT.
          Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE.

                         RICK
          All right, give me one of those
          things.
          As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we

                         SUPER:

                          75 MINUTES LATER

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

          A dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their
          cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of
          them speak. Then:

                         FRED
          What kind of soap do you use?

                         RICK

                         (BEAT)
          You mean in the shower?

                         FRED
          Yeah.

                         RICK
          Dove.

                         FRED
          Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry
          your skin so much.
          Fred stares into space.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Sometimes it's hard to wash off,
          though. Because of the moisturizer.
          You ever notice--?

                         RICK
          I think Hog-head's dead.
          Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN
          A SAND TRAP. He's not moving.

                         FRED

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Hog-head...? Are you okay?
          As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an
          elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart.

                         RANGER
          What the hell is he doing?
          Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority
          figure.

                         RICK
          Uh, he's having back spasms.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

                         RANGER
          Not him. Him.
          Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the
          MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM.

                         RICK

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Gary! What are you doing?!

                         GARY
          I don't know--you tell me!
          Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick,
          annoyed.

                         RANGER
          Look, this is the third time I've
          had to flag your group and you're
          only on the fourth hole. Now if I
          have to come out here again, you're
          done for the day.

                         RICK
          Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir.
          The Ranger shoots them a look and DRIVES OFF toward the TWO
          ASIAN FOURSOMES waiting on the tee behind them.

          EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY

          The four guys are unnaturally bunched together on another
          fairway.

                         RICK
          Think. Where did you last see it?

                         GARY
          On the course.

                         RICK
          Where on the course?

                         GARY
          I don't know--on a fairway, I
          think. I clot out, grabbed my club,
          took a swing, and when I turned
          around it had disappeared.

                         RICK
          You're serious? You're telling us
          you lost your golf cart?

                         FRED

                         (STONER VOICE)
          Dude, where's my golf cart?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          Shut up, Fred.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Guys, I gotta go poo again.

                         GARY
          I didn't lose it, I think it was
          stolen.

                         RICK

                         (ANNOYED)
          Who would steal a golf cart?
          Gary shrugs.

                         GARY
          Criminals?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Does anyone have any napkins?

                         GARY
          Look, all I know is I had it on the
          seventh tee and now it's gone.

                         RICK
          What are you talking about? We're
          only on the sixth hole.

                         GARY
          What? Did we miss a hole? Where's
          my kids?
          Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it
          together. Then he NOTICES something O.S..

                         RICK
          Oh, come on, man!
          ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker
          PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his
          O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and
          the guys look up.
          THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading
          straight for them.

                         FRED
          Run for it!
          The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick
          and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF
          THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger

          HOT IN PURSUIT.

                         GARY
          He's gaining on us!

                         RICK
          I can't go any faster, I've got it
          floored!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         FRED
          Cut through the woods!
          Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and
          Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART.
          With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog-
          head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick
          slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then
          he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE

          WOODS.

          EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY

          Ed and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having
          lunch with their two young children. Their 7-Year-Old
          Daughter is again dressed just like her mother and the 5-Year-
          Old Son is dressed like the father.

          Hey, Mom, look!
          The family turns to see...
          THEIR POV - a stoned-looking Rick, Fred, Hog-head and Gary
          are driving the golf cart down the city street. They stop at
          a traffic light beside them. All the guys stare straight
          ahead, ZOMBIE-LIKE, except for Fred who NOTICES the Longs.
          He nods.

                         FRED
          Ed. Kimmy. Clones.
          The light changes and as the golf cart DRIVES OFF through the
          busy intersection, we go
          BACK ON ED AND KIMMY shaking their heads.

                         KIMMY
          Their poor wives.

                         DAY 3

          EXT. BASEBALL FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

          It's a picture perfect day as a THOUSAND PEOPLE watch a Cape
          Cod League baseball game rom the comfort of their picnic
          blankets. The home team has loaded the bases in the bottom
          of the ninth and Grace, Maggie, MAGGIE'S PARENTS, and the
          kids are CLAPPING ALONG WITH THE CROWD.
          CRACK! The BATTER HITS A ROPE TO RIGHT FIELD, and as the
          TYING and WINNING RUNS SCORE the PLACE GOES WILD.

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after
          the game.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.
          Grace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch
          Maggie's kids run the bases. The wives look TANNED and
          REFRESHED from several days laying on the beach.
          Just then a big, goofy kid named GERRY approaches. He's a
          strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a
          perpetual SHIT-EATING GRIN.

                         GERRY
          Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming
          out and supporting us.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, it was fun. You guys looked
          good.

                         GERRY
          Thanks.
          Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging
          him on.

                         GERRY (CONT'D)
          So...we saw you sitting up there
          with those little kids--are you
          nannies or something?
          The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile.

                         MAGGIE
          No, they're my kids.

                         GERRY

                         (DUBIOUS)
          Yeah, right. You have three kids?

                         MAGGIE
          Uh-huh.
          A couple other PLAYERS amble over.

                         GERRY
          Dudes, they're not nannies, they're
          mommies.

                         PLAYER #2
          No way?!

                         GRACE
          Well, she is, not me. I'm not old
          enough yet.
          Maggie and the players LAUGH.

          RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)
          Guys!
          The players turn to see their coach, RICK COLEMAN,
          approaching with MAGGIE'S FATHER, mid-70's.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Time to pack things up--let's go!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.
          The Players quickly scatter.

                         MAGGIE'S FATHER
          Maggie, Grace, this is Rick Coleman-
          -the coach.
           Rick Coleman is a granite-jawed 38-year-old with a good head
          of hair and an easy-going manner.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          I hope those clowns weren't
          bothering you.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, no, they were sweet.

                         GRACE
          Yeah. Cute kids.

                         MAGGIE
          So you're the guy who's been taking
          money off my dad every Saturday on
          the golf course?

                         RICK COLEMAN
          I hate to break it to you but your
          old man's the one who's been taking
          all the money--he's a thief.
          Maggie's Father LAUGHS.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Hey, everyone's coming back to my
          place for some beers and a barbecue-
          -why don't you join us?

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the
          kids home.

                         MAGGIE'S FATHER
          Your mom and I will take 'em home.
          You two go out and have a good time-
          -cripes, you haven't been out all
          week.
          Grace perks up at this.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really

                         HADN'T PLANNED--

                         GRACE
          Excuse me, can I have a word with
          you?
          Grace pulls Maggie aside.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERING)
          What's your problem?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are
          barely out of college, and, in case
          you've forgotten, we're married.

                         GRACE
          To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred
          had the week off from marriage. So
          remind me again--who are we married
          to?
          Maggie thinks about this.

                         MAGGIE
          Well...I guess one beer won't kill
          us.

                         GRACE

                         (SMILING)
          That's my girl.
          Grace glances over at the ballplayers.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Why shouldn't we have fun? God
          knows our guys are living it up.

                         CUT TO:

          A CLOSE-UP OF HOG-HEAD

                         HOG-HEAD
          What would you guys rather do--make-
          out with a guy or let him blow you?
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL that...

          INT. ESPN SPORTS ZONE BAR - CONTINUOUS

          .Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and
          devouring plates of HOT WINGS. Around them we see about
          fifty TV's BLARING twenty different sporting events. There's
          ESPN logos everywhere and not a woman in sight.

                         HOG-HEAD (CONT'D)
          And you've gotta pick one or
          someone in your family will die--
          that's the rule.

                         GARY
          Oh boy, that's a toughie.

                         FRED
          How long would you have to make-out
          with him?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Ten minutes.

                         RICK
          Tongue?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Of course.

                         FRED
          And how long would he have to blow
          you?

                         HOG-HEAD
          Seven minutes.

                         GARY
          Oof. I mean, getting blown by a
          dude is bad, but making out with a
          guy, it's so.. .intimate.

                         RICK
          You think it's more intimate than
          getting blown by a guy?

                         GARY
          Way more.

                         BAKER
          All right, the hell with this shit,
          I'm outta here.
          Baker gets up from his stool.

                         RICK

                         (TAKEN ABACK)
          What? Why?

                         BAKER
          I wanted to watch you guys pick up
          chicks, not talk about dicks.

                         FRED
          Hey, greased lightning, let off the
          gas--sometimes these things take
          time.

                         GARY
          Baker's right. This is day three
          and you haven't even talked to a
          girl.

                         RICK

                         (POINTED)
          That's not exactly accurate, Gary.
          Thanks to your scrumptious
          brownies, I did spend half of last
          night talking to Judy on the drug-
          and-poison hotline.
          Hog-head and Gary stand.

                         HOG-HEAD
          I guess I'm gonna get going, too.

                         GARY
          Yeah, this is boring. You guys are
          pussies.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.

                         FRED
          Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk
          to any girls.

                         BAKER
          We don't have hall passes!

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          Come on, guys, let's go.
          The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and
          turns.

                         HOG-HEAD
          Hey, guys, it's all right if you
          strike-out.. .but for godsakes, at
          least take a couple of swings.
          A moment later the guys are gone and a humbled Rick and Fred
          sit there feeling alone.

                         FRED

                         (BEING BRAVE)
          This is actually good--you know,
          that they're leaving. You don't
          need five hunters to bag two birds.

                         RICK
          No, you do not. And I love those
          guys but, let's be honest, they're
          not exactly chick-magnets.

                         FRED
          You can say that again. Yep, the
          steak always looks better if you
          trim away some of the fat. And
          let's face it, we are the steak.

                         RICK
          Dream team, baby.
          The guys CLINK BEERS. Then:

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Maybe we should call the girls and
          ask them to come home.
          Fred glances at him, aghast.

                         FRED
          What?

                         RICK
          Who are we kidding, man? Do you
          really think we're going to be
          picking up any girls this week?

                         FRED
          Why wouldn't we?

                         RICK
          Because that's not us anymore.

                         FRED
          Wait a second. You want to quit?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         RICK
          Fred, we're not the same guys we
          were fifteen years ago, back when
          we were single. We've changed.
          Fred stares at him, incredulous.

                         FRED
          No, man, you've changed. All you
          care about is yourself--what about
          all the guys out there who are
          counting on us to make this thing
          work?

                         RICK
          What are you talking about?

                         FRED
          Don't you get it?

                         (DRAMATIC BEAT)
          We're the chosen ones!
          Fred stands up and points at Rick.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          That's right--this thing is bigger
          than us! Our wives didn't give us
          this hall pass, the good Lord did!
          And what do we have to show for it?
          Nothing.

                         RICK
          Come off it, Fred. Obviously
          hooking up isn't something we
          really want--if it was, we could've
          done it by now.

                         FRED
          Could we have?
          Rick is taken aback by this.

                         RICK

                         (WANING CONFIDENCE)
          Well ...of course. I mean, if we'd
          really wanted to.

                         FRED
          Guess what? I did want to. And you
          know how close I got? We're three
          days in and the only woman I've
          spoken to was our waitress at
          Outback. And she never even made
          eye-contact.

                         RICK
          I don't really care if some
          waitress makes eye-contact. I want
          to go home--I miss my wife and
          kids.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         FRED
          Let me explain something to you: If
          Grace and Maggie find out we can't
          get laid on our own, they'll start
          thinking we need them to get laid.
          Do you know what that'll do to the
          balance of power in our homes?
          It'll destroy it!
          Rick thinks about this and grows alarmed.

                         RICK
          Well, what if we just tell them
          that we did hook up?

                         FRED
          We can't. Grace'll know. She always
          knows when I'm lying.

                         RICK
          Hey, what about a massage parlor?

                         FRED
          No! That's giving up.
          Fred glares at him.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You don't get it, do you? A hall
          pass ain't all about sex. It's
          about being man enough to pick up a
          woman even though you may not be
          what--in the traditional sense--is
          considered...
          (makes quotes with

                         FINGERS)
          .good-looking, or...
          (finger quotes again)
          .appealing.
          Rick seems stung by this news.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Look, if we can't show that
          something positive can come from
          having a hall pass, then the whole
          concept is dead. Not just for
          us...but for all mankind.
          Rick thinks about this for a moment, then stands up with a

          RENEWED SENSE OF PURPOSE.

                         RICK
          All right, let's get out of here. I
          know exactly where we should be.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

          The party's in full swing. A hundred or so PLAYERS, PLAYER'S
          GIRLFRIENDS, and FRIENDS are in and out of the pool, drinking
          beer and rocking out to Arcade Fire on the boombox.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.
          ANGLE ON Maggie and Rick Coleman sipping beers while in the
          b.g. we see Grace PLAYING VOLLEYBALL in the pool (still in
          the shorts and t-shirt she wore that afternoon.)

                         MAGGIE
          So how about you, Rick, do you have
          any children?

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Nah, but maybe some day. Your mom
          keeps talking about hooking me up
          with your cousin Kate.
          Maggie LAUGHS.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          That's not a good sign.

                         MAGGIE
          No, I hardly know her. She moved to
          Miami when I was eight.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          That's what your mom said. I coach
          at the University of Miami.

                         MAGGIE
          Then you should go out with her.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Nice try.

                         (BEAT)
          So how about yourself--how long you
          been married?

                         MAGGIE
          Uh...fourteen years. We were
          college sweethearts.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Nice. And where is he this week?

                         MAGGIE
          He's up in Boston.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Poor guy. All work and no play,
          huh?
          Maggie forces a smile.

                         MAGGIE
          Something like that.
          Suddenly Grace is PROPELLED OUT OF THE WATER and UP ONTO

          GERRY'S SHOULDERS.

                         GRACE
          Stop it! What are you doing?!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.
          Gerry LAUGHS and BOUNCES AROUND THE POOL and Grace and Maggie
          and the coach can't help but LAUGH along with him, as we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. RAMADA INN - NIGHT

          Rick and Fred pull into the hotel's lot in the mini-van. As
          Rick gets out, Fred reaches behind his seat and comes out
          clutching a MOTORCYCLE HELMET. Rick stares at him.

                         FRED

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Chicks dig motorcycles.

          INT. RAMADA INN OLDIE'S BAR - NIGHT

          It's 80's night and a Hall & Oates cover band is PLAYING
          complete with look-alikes, except Oates is black. Behind the
          band there's a banner that reads: 'Ramada Inn proudly
          welcomes the Mutual of Omaha Leadership Council!' We see
          middle-aged CORPORATE TYPES everywhere.

                         DARRYL HALL

                         (SINGING)
          ". .Oh-oh here she comes, watch out
          boy she'll chew you up. Oh-oh here
          she comes, she's a maneater..."
          ANGLE ON THE BAR where Rick and Fred are checking out the
          scene. Fred is WEARING THE HELMET. (It's a huge BLACK,
          OVERSIZED HELMET WITH A VISOR.) He pulls it off, SHAKES OUT
          HIS HAIR, and places it prominently ON THE BAR.

                         FRED
          Jackpot, baby.
          Rick NOTICES SOMETHING O.S..

                         RICK
          How about those two?
          ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table.

                         FRED
          Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes.
          Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands
          it to Rick.

                         RICK
          What's this?

                         FRED
          I went on-line this afternoon and
          wrote down some good pick-up lines
          to break the ice.

                         RICK

                         (READING)
          'Hi. Will you help me find my
          puppy? I think he ran into the
          cheap hotel across the street.'

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.

                         FRED
          That's a good one--except for one
          thing: We don't have a puppy, so
          when she gets there she'll realize
          we're full of shit.
          Rick shoots him a look.

                         RICK
          I don't think it's supposed to be
          for real. It's just to make her
          laugh so she'll talk to you.
          Fred considers this.

                         FRED
          Oh God no, it doesn't work on that
          level. Here, this is my favorite.
          He takes the paper from Rick.

                         FRED (CONT'D)

                         (READING)
          'You must be from Ireland because
          when I look at you my penis is
          Dublin.'

                         RICK
          It's a charmer but you know what?
          We don't need phony pick-up lines.
          Why don't we just be ourselves?

                         FRED
          Great. If you know how to.
          Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself.

                         RICK
          Give me the helmet.
          Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two
          Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on
          his heels.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hi.
          The women give him a pleasant look.

                         LATINO WOMAN #1
          Hello.
          Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick.

                         FRED
          Hola.
          LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then:

                         RICK
          Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like
          I'm back at my first junior high
          school mixer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.
          Rick and Fred force a LAUGH and the girls smile. Another
          LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE BEAT. Rick clears his throat.

                         RICK CONT'D)
          So...are you ladies from Ireland?

                         LATINO WOMAN #2
          No.

          RICK.
          I'm very surprised to hear that
          news, because when I look at you my
          penis doubles in size.
          The women FLINCH at this, losing their smiles. Fred leans in.

                         FRED
          No, he means his dick is Dublin.
          Like the city. In Ireland.
          As the girls turn away from them, we begin a...
          MUSIC MONTAGE - Hall & Oates' I Can't Go For That plays as
          our GUYS GET SHOT DOWN by a DOZEN DIFFERENT BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.

                         END MONTAGE

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          Rick and Fred are at the bar looking TIRED and FRUSTRATED.

                         RICK
          I have this overwhelming urge to
          donkey-kick everyone in this bar.

                         FRED
          Okay, tiger, keep your chin up--no
          one said this was going to be easy.
          Even in college you had to take
          fifty rejections for every score,
          remember?

                         RICK
          Yeah, but it didn't sting so much
          when I was drunk.
          Fred perks up.

                         FRED
          That's it! We should be drinking!

                         RICK
          You're right. We're too stiff.

                         FRED
          Way too stiff. We gotta start
          pounding 'em, get those creative
          juices flowing, bring the soul to
          the surface.
          Rick smiles.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         RICK
          That's when we're at our most
          charming!

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          A HAMMERED Fred is HOLDING A HAND OVER ONE EYE as he SHOUTS
          at a table full of GORGEOUS YOUNG WOMEN.

                         FRED
          You say no to me? You say no to
          me?! I SAY NO TO YOU!
          He's being restrained by an unusually patient BOUNCER. In
          the b.g. we see Rick PASSED OUT ON A STOOL in a VERY AWKWARD

          POSITION.

                         BOUNCER
          Come on, buddy, let's go...
          The women glare at Fred with disgust, maybe even a little
          amusement.

                         FRED
          No, screw them!
          (pointing at the women)
          You think your shit don't stink?!
          Well I got news for ya: I wouldn't
          titty-bang you in a snow storm!

                         20-SOMETHING WOMAN
          (mocking),
          Oh, please, sir, please titty-bang
          us in a snow storm!
          The women LAUGH.

                         FRED
          Nope, you blew it, not gonna
          happen.

                         BOUNCER
          (still restraining Fred)
          There you go, mister, you got 'em
          good. Now let's go.
          As the Bouncer drags him toward the exit, a STUNNING GIRL
          passes them WEARING TIGHT LEATHER PANTS with an AMERICAN FLAG
          PRINT ON THE BUTT. Fred turns to her.

                         FRED

                         (SLURRING)
          Hey, sweetie, you need a pole for
          that flag?
          Just then, the Girl's LARGE BOYFRIEND appears, and as his

          A worn-out-looking Rick is working at his desk when Fred
          approaches (with a BLACK EYE.)

                         FRED
          I know what we've been doing wrong.
          Rick lifts his chin.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          If we're gonna break out of this
          slump, we've got to start using our
          strength. And that is.. .people who
          know us, like us. So we should go
          after the women we've already won
          over.

                         RICK
          You mean like our wives?

                         FRED
          Yeah, like that, but not them.
          Fred sits in the chair across from Rick.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          I was thinking Coffee Girl.

                         RICK
          You've won over Coffee Girl?

                         FRED
          Well, I'm sure she'd recognize me.
          Rick thinks about this.

                         RICK
          Look, if you really want to go
          after someone you already know,
          have you considered Missy
          Frankenfield?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          Fred's listening.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
           She's got all the stats you like--
          she's beautiful, you k now her phone n ow-
           number, she's freshly divorced...

                         FRED
          Which according to Hog-head means
          she's horny.

          Gerry WATERSKIING toward them.Helets go of the rope and

          Grace and Maggie sit up and smile.

                         GRACE
          What are you doing here?
          He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY

          My parents took them to Martha's

          INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

          Rick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in
          slacks and a Harvard t-shirt. Music plays. He peers ahead
          and sees the Wannabe Artist-Type taking the order of a
          TEENAGE GIRL. At the other register, Coffee Girl is also
          taking orders. Rick is hoping to get Coffee Girl but Wannabe
          gets to him first.

                         WANNABE
          Can I take your order?
          Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the
          Wannabe.

                         RICK
          Uh...I don't know what I want.
          Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few
          moments, then levels with the guy.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Look, man, I want her to take my
          order.

                         WANNABE
          Why?

                         RICK
          Uh, she knows how I like it.

                         WANNABE

                         (ATTITUDE)
          Little help, Leigh--your unique
          barista skills have been requested.
          Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks. As Leigh approaches,
          Wannabe mocks Rick by waving at him and winking.

                         LEIGH
          Hi. What would you like?
          Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is
          crowding them.

                         RICK
          Iced coffee. With two Splendas.
          Leigh rings him up.

                         LEIGH
          That'll be two dollars.
          Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers.

                         RICK
          By the way, nice tunes. Do you
          choose 'em or do they come down
          from corporate?

                         LEIGH
          Me. It's Snow Patrol.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.
          She hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar.

                         RICK
          Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid
          movie, too.
          Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH.

                         WANNABE
          Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s--
          the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This
          is Snow Patrol, the band.
          Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed.

                         LEIGH
          Thanks for the tip.
          As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe
          SAYS SOMETHING to her that WE CAN'T HEAR and they both LAUGH.
          A PHONE RINGS in the employee room. Leigh hands Wannabe the
          coffee, then runs back to answer it. Wannabe hands Rick the
          iced coffee and winks at him.

                         WANNABE
          Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced
          coffee, mister.
          Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe.
          Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back.

                         RICK
          Why are you smiling? You think this
          counter is some alligator-infested
          moat?
          Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile.

          punks like you. So shape up.
          As Rick turns and walks out, we PAN over to see that Leigh

          HAS BEEN WATCHING THIS.

          EXT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Rick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his
          coffee. He NOTICES some postcards advertising a two-week
          free trial at the local gym and starts to read them.

          LEIGH (O.S.)
          I work-out there.

          Rick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh.

                         RICK
          You do?
          Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I work-out at home, but I was
          thinking of going public with my
          work-outs. What do you squat?
          She seems amused by this.

                         LEIGH
          I don't really squat, just run on
          the hamster-wheel everyday after
          work.
          She starts wiping down a table.

                         COFFEE GIRL
          So did you go to Harvard?
          She nods at Rick's t-shirt.

                         RICK
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          I mean, you know...I went to a
          party there once.
          Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up.

          Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too
          much.
          (holds up gym postcard)
          So is this a good place to join?

                         LEIGH
          Great place. Real chill. And they
          have a bar, so I always grab a beer
          after my workout.

                         RICK
          Bitchin'. Sounds like a nice
          routine. Maybe I'll routine it,
          too.

                         LEIGH
          If you join, tell 'em Leigh sent
          you--they'll give me two free
          months.

                         RICK
          I'll do that, Leigh.

                         LEIGH
          Rockin'.
          Leigh gives him the peace sign.

          R-O-C-K in the U-S-A.
          Leigh smiles and as she heads back inside, we

          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          Fred is sitting on his bed flipping through his address book
          until he comes to Missy Frankenfield. He hits the
          SPEAKERPHONE and DIALS. Several RINGS later:

          MISSY FRANKENFIELD (V.0.)
          Hi, this is Missy. Sorry I missed
          your call. I'm out of town for a
          few days, and I may have limited
          cell reception. Please leave a
          message and I'll get back to you as
          soon as I can. BEEP.
          Fred mouths the word 'shit', then picks up the receiver.

                         FRED
          Hey, Missy, this is Fred Searing.
          I . uh, I dust wanted to give you a
          ring and, um...well, give me a call
          when you get back. It's kind of an
          emergency. Well, not life-
          threatening, but--
          The machine CUTS HIM OFF. Fred HANGS UP, dejected. He sits
          there for a BEAT, then grabs his keys and GOES OUT THE DOOR.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. STRIP MALL - LATE AFTERNOON

          TIGHT ON FRED - he's wearing SHADES and has a BASEBALL CAP
          pulled down over his eyes.
          PULL BACK TO REVEAL that he's outside a MASSAGE PARLOR. As
          he approaches the massage parlor entrance, a bunch of LADIES
          walk out of the TRAVEL AGENCY just to the right so Fred veers
          into the DRY CLEANERS to the left.

          INT. DRY CLEANERS - CONTINUOUS

          Fred ENTERS and immediately bumps into Kimmy Long (Ed's wife)
          standing in line behind several other WOMEN. She is
          accompanied by her 7-year-old daughter and neither of them
          look happy to see him.

                         FRED
          Oh, hi.
          Kimmy nods blankly. The Daughter glares at him. Fred
          nervously steps up next to them in line, passing time as he
          waits for the sidewalk to clear.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Um, I don't think I got a chance to
          tell you how impressed I was with
          your new place. Absolutely elegant.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.
          Kimmy GRUNTS a thank you and turns away from him.
          ANGLE ON the KOREAN LADY who owns the dry cleaners. She
          stands behind the desk with an accordion wall behind her.

          DRY CLEAN KOREAN LADY
          Mr. Searing, you pick up last week--
          no more clothes here!
          Fred smiles uncomfortably at Kimmy.

                         FRED
          That's right...
          (looks at watch)
          Well, gotta get going--I have a
          meeting across town in ten minutes.
          See ya.
          Fred EXITS.

          EXT. SIDEWALK - CONTINUOUS

          Fred comes out of the dry cleaners, makes sure the coast is
          clear, then DUCKS INTO THE MASSAGE PARLOR.

          INT. MASSAGE PARLOR - CONTINUOUS

          A YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN is behind the counter.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          You want massage?
          Fred looks around. There's an OLD KOREAN LADY sitting on a
          couch. He looks at the Young Korean Woman and nods.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You fill out.
          The Young Korean Woman hands Fred a form. Fred puts it down
          and covertly moves in.

                         FRED
          I'd prefer no paper trail.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Need for insurance company.

                         FRED
          I don't think my insurance
          company's gonna cover this one.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Ten dollar co-pay?

                         FRED
          Uh, no.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Fill out form. It policy.
          Fred moves in closer.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         FRED
          Look, I don't really want this in
          print.
          The Young Korean Woman hands him back the form.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          How I know what you want if you no
          fill out form?

                         FRED
          Um, couldn't I just tell you?
          She stares at him for a LONG BEAT.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          So, what you waiting for?!
          Fred glances back at the Old Korean Lady, then WHISPERS in
          the Young Korean Woman's ear. She nods and looks at him.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN (CONT'D)
          Okay.. .but must see I.D. first.
          Fred SIGHS and pulls out a hundred-dollar bill.

                         FRED
          How about a C-note so I don't have
          to fill out any forms or show any
          I.D.'s?
          The Young Korean Woman thinks about this for a moment, then
          SLIDES OPEN THE ACCORDION WALL behind her, REVEALING...
          THE DRY CLEANERS NEXT DOOR - the Dry Cleaning Korean Lady
          looks back at him, along with Kimmy Long, her daughter, and

          ALL THE OTHER WOMEN IN LINE.

          YOUNG KOREAN WOMAN
          Gentleman want a rub-and-tug with
          tea-bag happy ending but don't fill
          out form!
          Kimmy Long glares at him, appalled. As Fred backpedals OUT
          OF THE MASSAGE PARLOR, he waves at her weakly, and we...

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARTY BOAT - DAY

          One hundred GUESTS dance on the top deck of this large ship
          as the Bee Gee's Night Fever BLASTS from the speakers.

                         SONG
          .Night fever, night fever.. .we
          know how to do it...'
          As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick
          Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS.
          They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are
          thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting
          tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her
          own on a dance floor.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.
          The crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as
          Rick and Gerry SWING AND LIFT our delighted and breathless
          wives, we

                         CUT TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat
          taking a breather.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Wow. You can really move out there.
          Maggie shrugs modestly.

                         MAGGIE
          Thanks. I was a dance major in
          college.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Really? I always wondered--what do
          you do with a degree in dance?

                         MAGGIE
          Well, as it turned out, nothing.

                         (BLUSHING)
          I guess the original plan was to go
          to New York and try to hook-up with
          one of the big dance companies, but
          then I got married and. . .your
          priorities change.
          She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Anyway, that was fun. I haven't
          danced this much in a long time.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Why not?

                         MAGGIE
          I don't know, you get busy, kids,
          school, there's so much going on.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Well you gotta make time for the
          stuff you love or you'll forget who
          you are.
          Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye-
          contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks
          away.

                         MAGGIE
          You know, my husband's name is
          Rick.
          Rick smiles at this.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Well that makes me the perfect guy
          to have an affair with--you'd never
          have to worry about screaming out
          the wrong name during sex.
          Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding.

                         MAGGIE
          I know.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Now come on, let's go find Grace
          and get something to eat. I'm
          starving.
          As they head back to the party, we

          INT. RICK'S TOYOTA AVALON - LATE AFTERNOON

          Rick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH
          CLUB. He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the
          entrance for Leigh. Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the
          window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's
          poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick
          rolls down the window.

                         FLATS
          Hey, Rick.

                         RICK

                         (STARTLED)
          Oh...hey, Flats. How you doing,
          man?

                         FLATS
          Great. What's up with you? How's
          that hall pass thing going?
          Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed.

                         RICK
          Who told you about that--was it Hog-
          head?

                         FLATS
          No. Some old lady was yakking about
          it down at the post office.
          Rick REACTS to this.

                         FLATS (CONT'D)

                         (BIG SMILE)
          So what's the deal--you getting
          laid?

                         RICK

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          What? No.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I don't know where you're getting
          your information, Flats, but a hall
          pass isn't just about getting laid,
          it's about getting a week off from
          marriage to do as you please--
          whether that be fishing, or
          watching TV, whatever it is that
          relaxes you.

                         FLATS

                         (DUBIOUS)
          Oh, I didn't know that.
          Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes)
          walking down the sidewalk toward the gym.

                         RICK
          Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late
          for my work-out appointment.
          When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym
          shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then
          grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS
          WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Hey, girl!

                         LEIGH

                         (SMILING)
          All right! You decided to go for
          it.
          As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS

                         OUT:

                         FLATS
          Hey, Rick! Good luck with the
          fishing!
          As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the
          building.

          INT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER

          Rick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude,
          CLYDE, looks up from folding towels.

                         LEIGH
          Clyde, this is my friend, uh...

                         RICK
          Rick.

                         LEIGH
          He's looking to join.

                         CLYDE
          Great. I'll get you signed up.
          Leigh pats Rick's hand.

                         LEIGH
          See ya.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.
          She turns to leave.

                         RICK
          So, uh, are you gonna grab a
          brewski after your work-out?

                         LEIGH
          Nah.
          Rick looks disappointed.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna grab two.
          Leigh flashes him a smile and as she walks away, she gives
          him the peace sign. He returns it.

                         RICK
          Peace it!
          As soon as he hears himself, Rick cringes.

                         CUT TO:
          CLOSE ON RICK'S FACE - he's wearing the headphones and has
          worked up a PRETTY GOOD SWEAT.
          PULL BACK to reveal that he's SITTING ON THE TOILET.

          INT. HEALTH CLUB - MEN'S LOCKER ROOM - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER

          We hear a FLUSH. Rick shuffles out of a stall and moves to a
          sink. While he washes his hands, a young, NAKED, METROSEXUAL-
          TYPE whips his leg into the sink beside him. Rick slowly
          turns to look.
          RICK'S POV - as the Metrosexual talks to ANOTHER NAKED MAN,
          he fills his hand with SHAVING CREAM and the hand DISAPPEARS
          BETWEEN HIS OWN LEGS. The guys continue their conversation,
          unfazed. Then the Metrosexual starts to SHAVE HIS BALLS.
          As Rick dries his hands, he can't contain himself.

                         RICK
          What's that about--you swimming the
          English Channel?
          The Metrosexual shoots Rick an annoyed look.

                         METROSEXUAL
          Nah, Just not into looking like the
          knuckle-dragging guy on the
          evolution-of-man chart.
          Off Rick looking self-consciously down at his fur-covered
          body, we go...

          INT. HOT TUB ROOM - A FEW MINUTES LATER

          Rick ENTERS the empty hot tub room, takes off his towel, and
          eases into the STEAMING WATER. He hits a button and the jets
          kick on FULL BLAST, turning the hot tub into a BUBBLY

          CAULDRON.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

                         RICK
          Oh...yes.
          He bunches up his towel and puts it behind his head, then
          settles in and CLOSES HIS EYES.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          SAME SCENE - LATER
          Rick is in a DEEP SLEEP. His mouth is wide open but his head
          is BARELY ABOVE WATER as he SNORES LOUDLY. He dips beneath
          the surface and as he begins to CHOKE and COUGH, he wakes up.
          Rick takes a moment to get his bearings, then STRUGGLES to
          get out of the hot tub. But his MUSCLES HAVE TURNED TO JELLY.

                         RICK

                         (WEAKLY)
          Little help...
          When none comes, a life-and-death STRUGGLE ensues as the
          flabby, middle-aged dad tries to climb to safety.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Help ...me...
          Just as Rick starts to go under, the two young naked
          metrosexuals hear his MOANS and come to his rescue. They
          jump in the hot tub and heave him ashore. As Rick GASPS for
          air, one of the metrosexuals kneels down and lifts Rick's
          head onto his NAKED LAP.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1
          Are you having chest pains, sir?

                         RICK

                         (WINDED)
          No, no, I think I was...in the hot
          tub too long. I can't feel my body.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #2
          How long were you in there?

                         RICK
          What time is it?

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #2
          Seven-thirty.

                         RICK
          About three hours.
          That's when Rick realizes that his head is RESTING ON THE
          GUY'S COCK. He tries to roll off him, but Metrosexual #1

          HOLDS HIM TIGHT.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1
          Try not to move, sir.

                         RICK
          I'm okay, just help me up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         NAKED METROSEXUAL #1

                         (TO METROSEXUAL #2)
          All right, give him a hand.
          Metrosexual #2 straddles Rick's chest and leans down to pull
          him up. As Rick starts to rise, HIS FACE COMES PERILOUSLY
          CLOSE TO THE SECOND MAN'S O.S. DANGLING COCK and Rick has to

          TURN HIS HEAD TO AVOID CONTACT.
          They finally get Rick to his feet. As the naked men help him
          across the room, we
          ANGLE ON - two TANNED, HAIRLESS METROSEXUAL ASSES flanking
          Rick's HIRSUTE BUTT.

                         RICK
          Okay, thanks, guys. I can take it
          from here.
          The metrosexuals release Rick and he gets about two steps
          before his LEGS GIVE OUT and he TUMBLES DOWN A SMALL FLIGHT

          OF STEPS.

                         DAY 6

          INT. RICK AND FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

          A depressed Rick and Fred sit in bed numbing their pain by
          WATCHING THE BOURNE SUPREMACY and eating a couple PINTS OF

          BEN AND JERRY'S ICE CREAM.

                         FRED
          We let down the male species.

                         (SIGHS)
          I really thought our hall passes
          might change the philosophy of
          marriage in America.
          Fred eats a big scoop of ice cream.

                         FRED (CONT'D)

                         (WITH MOUTH-FULL)
          I envisioned a national holiday,
          right between July 4th and Labor
          Day, like the first Friday in
          August, Hall Pass Day; a day for
          husbands to get some strange, a day
          that would forever be known as the
          holiday,that saved the institution
          of marriage.

                         RICK
          All right, don't give up.

                         FRED
          I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts-
          -this is our last day and we got
          nothing cooking. Maybe you were
          right. Maybe we should just tell
          the girls to come home.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         RICK
          No. I want the hall pass.
          Fred looks at Rick, surprised.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          At first I wasn't sure, but now I
          want the dream.

                         FRED
          I'm not even sure I know what the
          dream is anymore.

                         RICK
          I just...I just want to know what
          it's like to be with another woman.

                         FRED
          Well, just pull up one of the
          golden oldies in your spank bank--
          it's almost like being there.

                         RICK
          I don't have anything in that spank
          bank.

                         FRED
          I'm talking about all the girls
          before you met Maggie.
          Rick doesn't say anything.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          What?

                         (BEAT)
          No, you're not serious?
          Rick lowers his head.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Wait a second, are you saying...?

                         (BEAT)
          But how can that be--you didn't
          meet Maggie until college?

                         RICK

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Yeah, so? What do you think,
          everyone gets laid in high school?
          I got news for you, mister--getting
          laid in high school is not a right,
          it's a privilege.
          Fred puts down his ice cream. Rick SIGHS.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          First class, first day, freshman
          year, I saw Maggie--she was sitting
          three seats away in Western Civ--
          and I fell in love instantly. I
          begged her for three months to go
          out with me, she finally caved, and
          that night I told her I loved her.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          Eighty-four days later she told me
          she loved me back and we've been
          together ever since.
          Fred stares at him.

                         FRED
          Wow. That's a really creepy story.
          Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Hello.

                         (BEAT)
          Yeah.

                         (BEAT)
          Oh, okay, great.
          Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything.

                         RICK
          Who was that?

                         FRED
          Just an angel from heaven.
          Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet.

                          FRED (CONT'D)
           Coakley's back in town!

          BOUQUET OF FLOWERS and an open GIFT BOX displaying an

          ENGRAVED I.D. BRACELET.

                         MAGGIE
          Does this mean you're going steady?

                         (GUILTY)
          That's not funny. I feel terrible--
          the poor kid's spending all his
          hard-earned money on me--that's
          sad. Cute, but sad.

                         MAGGIE
          Grace, you should be flattered.
          You're thirty-eight-years-old and
          college kids are still swooning
          over you.

                         GRACE
          Well I just feel bad if I gave him
          the wrong impression.

          flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love

          Just texting Missy Frankenfield

          You don't need Missy Frankenfield
          tonight. If we can't get the job
          done with Coakley as our wingman,
          then we're pathetic.

          MAN dressed HEAD-TO-TOE IN MOTORCYCLE LEATHERS (think Larry

          The guys look at each other, then reluctantly COUGH UP THE
          DOUGH. With money in hand, Coakley marches confidently
          across the street followed by Fred and Rick. When the SLICK

          Guys, you're not trying to get
          married here--you're trying to get
          laid.

          Is that for the ugly girls?

          I go to the Tropic finals because
          Miss North Dakota's gonna lose and
          she's gonna need a hug. And quite
          often you can parlay a hug into a

          Paige who's looking a LITTLE TIPSY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         RICK
          Oh, hey, Paige. What are you doing
          here?
          She pulls out her license and holds it up.

                         PAIGE
          I turned twenty-one yesterday.

                         (DRUNKEN SMILE)
          I'm legal now.

                         RICK
          Oh. Well, happy birthday. You out
          celebrating?

                         PAIGE
          Yeah, I'm here with my Aunt Meg.
          Paige points across the club to AUNT MEG, a striking redhead,
          early 40's, who's talking to a couple of YOUNG MEN.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          She's the best. Forty-two years old
          but she still parties like she's my
          age.

                         RICK
          Nice.
          Rick continues to try to get the bartender's attention.

                         PAIGE
          So, Rick, how's the hall pass
          going?
          Paige smirks at Rick who shrinks a little.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          You don't mind if I call you Rick,
          do you? I am officially an adult
          now.

                         RICK
          No, of course not--what did you
          just say?

                         PAIGE
          I was asking about your hall pass.
          (off Rick's look)
          I baby-sit for the Putneys and I
          heard Gary talking about it the
          other night at their barbecue.
          Rick REACTS to this.

                         RICK
          He was talking about it at a
          barbecue?!

                         PAIGE
          Oh, he wasn't saying it in a bad
          way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         85

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          In fact, I thought it was very
          classy of you to be staying at the
          Holiday Inn Express instead of
          bringing girls back to your home
          with all the kids' pictures and
          schoolwork taped up everywhere.
          Rick forces a smile.

                         RICK
          Thank you.
          A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick.

                          RICK (CONT'D)
          Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and
          six glasses please.
          Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink.

                         PAIGE
          So does it work both ways?

                         RICK
          What?

                         PAIGE
          The hall pass. Does your wife get
          one, too.

                         RICK

                         (AMUSED)
          Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men
          only.

                         PAIGE
          Oh. Who made that rule?

                         RICK
          Well ...um...
          As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter.

                         PAIGE
          By the way, I kind of owe you an
          apology.
          (lowers her voice,

                         BASH
          Last week ful) when you drove me home, I
           shouldn't have snapped at you like
          that.

                         RICK
          Oh, don't worry about it. It was a
          big misunderstanding.

                         PAIGE
          No, it wasn't.
          She takes a moment, looks around.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         PAIGE (CONT'D)
          If you thought I was coming on to
          you that night, it's because...I
          was.
          Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with
          the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally
          pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love-
          with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage.

                         RICK
          Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but
          it was great seeing you.
          Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly
          annoyed.

                         PAIGE
          Are you serious? You're doing this
          again... even with a hall pass?

                         RICK
          Paige, you're my kids' babysitter.
          Have a happy birthday.
          As Rick walks away, we go
          BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne.

                         COAKLEY
          Here we go, bubbles doth floweth.

                         FRED
          Holy crap... look who's here.
          The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past
          with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP.

                         LEIGH
          Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday--
          I thought we were gonna grab a
          beer?
          Fred looks at Rick, confused.

                         RICK

                         (SHEEPISH)
          Yeah, I got a little caught up in
          my curls and reps and shit.

                         (CHANGING SUBJECT)
          So is this your playground?

                         LEIGH
          Nah, I've never been here, but a
          friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so
          I promised him I'd come.
          Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives
          Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones
          hanging around his neck.

                         WANNABE
          Wassup, girl?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.
          Wannabe NOTICES Rick and loses his smile.

                         WANNABE (CONT'D)
          Oh. Hey. What are you doing here--
          you auditing the place?

                         RICK
          Actually, I work for Sirius XM
          Radio--we're looking to hire some
          new deejays so I'm checking out all
          the clubs.
          Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful.

                         WANNABE
          Oh. Cool. Are you serious?

                         RICK
          Not!
          Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the
          deflated Wannabe.

                         WANNABE

                         (ANNOYED)
          Oh, that's hip. Real fresh.
          (turns to Leigh)
          Why don't you hit the dance floor--
          the next song's gonna be for you.
          As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe
          returns to his deejay booth.

                         FRED

                         (GLARING)
          Beer? When were you two going to
          have a beer?

                         RICK

                         (GUILTY)
          No, no, no, Leigh and I just belong
          to the same gym and happened to be
          there at the same time yesterday
          afternoon.

                         FRED
          What gym do you belong to and where
          the hell was I?

                         COAKLEY
          Well, according to Kimmy Long, you
          were at the massage parlor trying
          to get a rub-and-tug without
          filling out the paperwork.
          This takes the wind out of Fred's sails.

                         RICK
          What?
          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I thought the massage parlor was
          admitting defeat?

                         FRED
          I had a knot in my neck--why the
          hell didn't you tell me you saw
          Coffee Girl?!

                         COAKLEY
          Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all
          here for the same thing. And I'll
          give you a hint what that thing is:
          It begins with a 'P' and ends with
          an 'ussy.'
          Coakley puts his arm around Fred.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna
          get taken care ot.
          (looks out at crowd)
          We Just gotta find you a gazelle
          with a bad wheel.

                         FRED
          Huh?
          Coakley spots something.

                         COAKLEY
          Ooh--there's a couple of
          trainwrecks. Let's go.

                         FRED

                         (ALARMED)
          Whoa--wait a second.
          But Coakley steers Fred over to two CHUBBY, NOT-SO-ATTRACTIVE
          BLONDES laying on a 'bed' in the corner.

                         COAKLEY
          Ladies, this is my friend Fred
          Pinkberry--his yogurt company just
          went public and he's out
          celebrating. He'd like to offer you
          a flute of champagne.
          The Chubby Blondes PERK UP.

                         CHUBBY BLONDE #1
          I love Pinkberry!
          As the girls make room for a reluctant Fred, we go...
          BACK ACROSS THE ROOM where we see Rick watching Leigh and her
          hot girlfriends DANCE. Leigh catches Rick staring. He
          smiles and clumsily shoots her the PEACE SIGN. Finally, he
          takes a deep breath and DANCES HIS WAY UP NEXT TO HER.

                         RICK
          So.. .having a good time?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.

                         LEIGH
          Chillin'.

                         RICK
          Me too. Just chillin' and wigglin'.
          LONG BEAT as they dance. Then:

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I haven't been ancing in a long
          time.

                         LEIGH

                         (TEASING)
          I can tell.

                         RICK
          Oh yeah? Just try to keep up.
          She smiles at this, then Coakley DANCES UP BESIDE RICK and

          PULLS HIM ASIDE.

                         COAKLEY
          Abort! Abort! You stand not a
          chance.

                         RICK
          No, no, I think we're starting to
          gel.
          Coakley rolls his eyes.

                         COAKLEY
          No, no, you're mistaken. Look,
          dude, this ain't Operation Cock-
          block here--now trust me, retreat.
          Rick glances back at Leigh, torn. She looks fantastic.

                         RICK
          Coak, I'm never gonna have another
          hall pass, so this memory has to
          last a lifetime. . .you know what I
          mean?
          Coakley looks at Leigh and SIGHS.

                         COAKLEY
          All right, I'll be at the bar when
          this thing blows up in your face.
          As Rick dances back over to Leigh, we...
          PAN ACROSS THE ROOM to the PISSED-OFF Wannabe watching them
          from the deejay booth.

                         WANNABE

                         (INTO MIC)
          All right, 'all, adult-swim's
          over. Now if you was born before
          1980 you're gonna want to step off
          the floor 'cause we're about to
          kick it up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.
          ON RICK - he looks over at Wannabe but CONTINUES TO DANCE.

                         RICK
          Is this guy your boyfriend or
          something?

                         LEIGH
          No, no, no.
          She waves it off, then shrugs guiltily.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          One time we messed around a little.

                         RICK
          And what does 'messed around a
          little' mean these days?

                         LEIGH
          Anal.
          Rick tries hard to act nonchalant.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          I'm kidding. He kissed me one night
          and I kissed back--I shouldn't
          have.

          WANNABE (O.S.)
          Seriously, you grandpappies better
          get off the floor before someone
          falls and breaks a hip!
          Rick points at Wannabe.

                         RICK

                         (CALLING BACK)
          Just play your funky music, white
          boy!
           As the music shifts gears and becomes FASTER and LOUDER, we

                          CUT TO:

          INT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Maggie's at the sink cleaning up when she NOTICES that the
           ANSWERING MACHINE LIGHT IS BLINKING. She dries her hands,
          then pushes the button.

           HISPANIC WOMAN'S VOICE (V.0.)
           (on answering machine)
          Hola, Maggie, this is Isabel. I
          went to clean the house today but
          nobody has been there or slept in
          any of the beds this week, so I
          just cleaned the windows and left
          early. I hope you don't mind.
          CLOSE ON a concerned-looking Maggie. She moves to the
          window, stares at the lights on the ocean.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

          RICK COLEMAN (O.S.)
          Hey.
          Maggie turns to see Rick Coleman standing out on her front
          porch.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh. Hey.
          She goes to the screen door.

          Thought you might want to help me
          celebrate the end of the season.
          He holds up a grocery bag.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          I got some good late-night eats.
          Maggie hesitates a moment. Then she opens the door and lets
          him in.

          INT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT

          A bored-looking Fred is smooshed between the Chubby Blondes
          on the bed.

                         CHUBBY BLONDE #1
          It was the greys--you know, the
          tall, skinny aliens--and they were
          all over my yard, but--and here's
          the weird thing--I wasn't at all
          afraid of them so when they asked
          me if I wanted to get in their
          spaceship, I said, 'Sure,' and I
          walked right on.

                         CHUBBY BLONDE #2
          Oh my God, you're so brave! I would
          never, ever in a million years
          climb into one of those things.
          Fred, would you ever just walk into
          a UFO on your own?

                         FRED

                         (DEADPAN)
          If they came right now I would,
          sure.

          MISSY FRANKENFIELD (O.S.)
          There you are!
          Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching.

                         FRED
          Oh my god! You're here!
          Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         92

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Franken-berry, how the heck are
          ya?!
          She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          You look incredible!

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD

                         (CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Thanks, Fred, you look good, too.

                         FRED
          Never felt better.
          Missy nods.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I have to say, I can't believe I'm
          actually here--I was on my way home
          from dinner when I noticed your
          text. So what's this big emergency?

                         FRED
          Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I
          just meant that there's some
          important stuff I want to talk to
          you about. You know, one on one, me
          and you--without all the husbands
          and wives and hoopla. So how are
          you?

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I'm... good.

                         FRED
          No, I mean how-are-you. Inside.
          What's happenin' in there? There
          must be all sorts of emotions
          churning up with the divorce and
          everything.
          She gives him a long look.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Maybe we should go somewhere else--
          this doesn't seem like the best
          place to spill one's guts.
          Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside.

                         COAKLEY

                         (UNDER BREATH)
          What part of 'go ugly early' didn't
          you understand? You've got a better
          chance of winning husband-of-the-
          year than tagging that chiquita.
          Fred flinches at this.

                         FRED
          But...I know her. She said she
          wants to leave with me.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.

                         COAKLEY
          Then she's insane--run for the
          hills.

                         FRED
          Coak, the woman's going through a
          divorce. She's not insane, she's
          just making really poor decisions
          right now.
          (hands him his car keys)
          Here, give Rick the keys to my mini-
          van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel
          with Missy.
          Coakley looks back at Missy and softens.

                         COAKLEY
          It's your funeral, princess.
          BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF
          BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his
          hair is dripping wet.

                         LEIGH
          Are you okay--you keep checking
          your pulse?

                         RICK
          Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest
          cramp during the last song, but I
          worked through it.
          She smiles at this.

                         LEIGH
          Come on, let's sit this one out. I
          need a breather.
          They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a
          stack of cocktail napkins.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          So what's up with the ring?
          He looks at his finger, then back at her.

                         RICK
          Um...have you ever heard of a hall
          pass?

          EXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT

          Grace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC
          coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking
          nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry
          appears in the doorway.

                         GERRY
          There she is! Come on in, I'm
          mixing up some margaronis. We lost
          our final game, but I got four
          hits!

          Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone?

                         GERRY
          They all went out to party--now get
          in here!
          But Grace stays on the porch.

                         GRACE
          Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay.

                         GERRY
          What?
          Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it
          shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned.

                         GERRY (CONT'D)
          Is everything okay?

                         GRACE
          Yeah, yeah, everything's fine,
          but...
          (holds up gift box)
          .I can't accept this.

                         GERRY
          Why not?
          Grace does a double-take.

                         GRACE
          Gerry, I'm a married woman.
          Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the
          box and he reluctantly accepts it.

                         GERRY
          Um... I'm sorry if I made you
          uncomfortable, Grace. It's just
          that...I really like you.

                         GRACE
          I like you, too, Gerry, and you
          didn't make me uncomfortable.
          She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's
          some serious eye-contact, and then BAM!
          They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S
          NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they

          He holds up his ring hand.

                         LEIGH
          Yeah, I just thought your wife had
          died or something and you were
          wearing it out of respect.

          back to my place.

          Okay, but what am I gonna do there?

                         COAKLEY
          What do you mean, what are you
          gonna do? I've got a house with
          bedrooms--do the math. When it
          doesn't work out with her--which it
          won't--there's going to be a bunch
          of other back-up chicks there.
          Rick nods then turns to Leigh.

          I've got to be honest, Fred... I'm
          not really sure what we're doing
          here.

                         FRED
          What do you mean? We're hangin',
          we're connecting--that's what
          friends do. Especially if they want
          to take it to the next level where
          they can call each other 'good
          friends.'

          You're married, Fred.

                         FRED
          Ah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
          Fred opens the door but Missy stays in the hall.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD

          still married, right?

                         FRED
          Happily. Look, I don't want to get
          into all the details, but my wife
          gave me this one-time deal where I
          get to be with another woman.
          He opens the door wide. She looks at him for a BEAT.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          I thought we were going to the
          hotel bar?

                         FRED
          We are. There's a mini-bar in my
          room. You better hurry up, it's
          last call.
          Fred smiles.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Are you out of your flippin' mind?
          Fred loses the smile.

          Um...

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Are you out of your mind?!

                         FRED
          I'm going to be honest with you--
          your tone right now is scaring me.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          You call me up for the first time
          in your life, claim you have some
          kind of emergency, and it turns out
          that you just want to screw me?!

          What?

                         FRED
          What you just said--I had that
          coming. Big time.
          Fred hangs his head.

          Seriously, Missy, I...I don't know
          what's gotten into me this week. I
          think I must be having some kind of
          mid-life crisis or something
          because I've been acting like a
          real jackass.

                         (SIGHS
          Anyway ease forgive me. I
          really am very, very sorry and
          ashamed.
          Missy, standing a few feet away, finally calms down.

                         MISSY FRANKENFIELD
          Okay. Whatever.

          Fuck you, Fred!
          Missy STORMS away.

                         GRACE
          Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry,
          and you're very charming and very
          sweet and the last thing I wanted
          to do was hurt your feelings,
          but...well, what,just happened can
          never happen again.
          Gerry looks confused.

                         GERRY
          Oh.

                         GRACE
          I know it's probably hard for you
          to understand but...I love my
          husband.

                         GERRY
          So? What does that have to do with
          anything? Fate threw us together
          and we went with it--isn't that
          what life's all about?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.
          Grace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of
          his words.

                         GRACE
          Not always.

                         (BEAT)
          It wasn't fair to my husband... and
          it wasn't fair to you because this
          could never become anything more
          than just.. .what it was.
          She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out
          a LAUGH.

                         GERRY
          I know that.

                         GRACE
          You do?

                         GERRY

                         (BIG SMILE)
          Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no
          offense, but let's face it, you're
          a lot older than me.
          She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check
          for Grace.

                         GRACE
          Right.

                         GERRY
          I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm
          just saying, I didn't think we were
          going to start dating, you know?
          Could you imagine the looks we'd
          get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and
          his girlfriends--except in reverse.
          Gerry CHUCKLES.

                         GERRY (CONT'D)
          You'd be Hugh Hefner.

                         GRACE
          Yeah, I got that part.
          Gerry looks at his watch.

                         GERRY
          Ooh, I gotta get going. We have
          kind of a team meeting in like
          twenty minutes.
          Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M.

                         GERRY CONT'D
          It's, uh, kind o a tradition that
          we always get together on the night
          of the last game. It would probably
          be uncool if I missed it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         GRACE
          You don't have to explain.

                         GERRY
          Seriously, though, thanks for
          everything--that was awesome.
          He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then
          Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a
          moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START
          OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          This is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood.
          We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine' BLASTING from the
          street. There's thirty or so cars out front and PEOPLE are
          still arriving.

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SAME

          The place is JAMMING. It's a nice house but under-furnished
          in a bachelor pad kind of way. Rick and Leigh are in a
          corner drinking beers.

                         LEIGH
          I guess I still have a lot to get
          out of my system before I do the
          marriage trip. I'm one of those
          people who wants to try everything
          once before I die.

                         RICK

                         (BLURTING OUT)
          Have you ever been with a married
          guy?
          Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch.

                         LEIGH
          No.

                         RICK
          Neither have I.
          Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of
          truth.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          I'd like to help you take being
          with a married guy off your list of
          things to do before you die.

                         LEIGH
          You would?

                         RICK
          Yes.
          Leigh gets close.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          101.

                         LEIGH
          I don't want to be a home-wrecker.

                         RICK
          I've got a one-time pass, remember?

                         LEIGH
          That wasn't just a line?

                         RICK
          No. It's for real.
          Leigh seems intrigued. She moves closer still, takes his
          hand.

                         LEIGH
          So where can we go to talk some
          more about this?

                         RICK

                         (NERVOUS)
          Um, Coakley has a game room
          upstairs. We could.. .talk there.

          WANNABE (O.S.)
          Leigh!
          Rick and Leigh look over to see an AGITATED Wannabe forcing
          his way through the crowd.

                         WANNABE (CONT'D)
          Where have you...? Why didn't
          you...? You knew this was my big
          night! How could you just--?
          (turns away, emotional)
          Look, can I please talk to you in
          private? Now.
          Leigh looks apologetically at Rick.

                         LEIGH
          Can you give me a second?

                         RICK
          Sure.
          Wannabe and Leigh walk a few feet away and Rick watches them
          have an ANIMATED CONVERSATION. It appears Wannabe may even
          be crying. Finally, Wannabe storms across the room but when
          he gets to the door, he looks back at Leigh.

                         WANNABE
          Well? Are you coming?
          Leigh SIGHS, then approaches Rick.

                         LEIGH
          I'm sorry, Rick. I have to go deal
          with this.
          Rick can't believe what's happening.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         RICK
          Really? Now? I thought you said he
          wasn't your boyfriend.

                         LEIGH
          He's not...but he is a friend.
          Leigh glances at the broken-down Wannabe standing there at
          the door, then turns back to Rick.

                         LEIGH (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.
          Before Rick can stop her, Leigh LEAVES THE PARTY with
          Wannabe. After a LONG BEAT, Rick slides down into a chair,

          DEVASTATED.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. BEACH COTTAGE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Maggie is spilling her guts to Rick Coleman as he stands over
          the stove MAKING PANCAKES.

                         MAGGIE
          .And he hasn't even spent one
          night in his own bed this week.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Let me get this straight--you gave
          him his freedom and now you're mad
          that he's acting free?
          This logic clearly stings Maggie.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Hey, I'm sure there's an
          explanation. Maybe he took a trip
          somewhere?

                         MAGGIE
          I called his assistant--he's been
          in the office almost everyday.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Look, Maggie, for all you know your
          husband's been working at a sou
          kitchen, sleeping in his car al
          week, and he's only gotten laid two
          or three times at most.
          She looks up and forces a smile.

                         MAGGIE
          Ha-ha.
          Maggie checks her watch.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Jeez, I wonder what's taking Grace
          so long?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          103.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Well, if she went over to break the
          kid's heart, the least she could do
          is lend a sympathetic ear.
          He flips a pancake onto a plate.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Prepare yourself for heaven.
          She reaches for the plate, but he slaps her hand away.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          Not so fast, lady. I'm not
          finished. You have not lived until
          you've had my steaming hot
          blueberry pancakes...
          He pulls a carton of vanilla ice cream out of a bag.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          .A la mode.
          Maggie smiles.

                         MAGGIE
          Oh My-lanta.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          And to wash it all down...
          Rick reaches into the bag and pulls out a DESSERT WINE. Off
          Maggie's smile, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

          A glum Rick is walking through the PACKED PARTY when he bumps
          into Baker and Hog-Head standing around a keg with a GROUP OF

          GUYS.

                         RICK
          Hey. . .what are you guys doing here?

                         HOG-HEAD
          We're here for the hall pass.

                         RICK
          Really? I thought you guys had
          given up on us?

                         BAKER
          We did. We're here with them.
          He nods toward RICK LEARY and WILLY BOSHANE, both early 40's
          and paunchy.

                         RICK
          What are you talking about?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          104.

                         BAKER
          When Leary and Boshane heard about
          your guy's hall pass, they
          convinced their wives to give them
          one, too.
          A smiling Leary tries to HIGH-FIVE Rick, but he's having none
          of it. He turns to Baker, livid.

                         RICK
          You weren't supposed to tell anyone
          about the hall pass!

                         LEARY
          They didn't say anything. Our wives
          heard about it at the pool.

                         RICK
          No! At the pool?!
          Rick rubs his face, distressed.

                         BOSHANE
          Yep. And then about three days ago--
          after some hard-core negotiating--
          we managed to push the bill
          through.
          The guys LAUGH. Rick can hardly believe what he's spawned.

                         RICK
          Really? So...how's it going?

                         BOSHANE
          Solid. Very solid.

                         LEARY
          We're building mucho momentumo.
          Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION.

                         LEARY (CONT'D)

                         (ANNOYED)
          Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just
          about sex, you know.

                         BOSHANE
          That's right. It's about going
          bowling and, uh, staying up late,
          and being able to do what you want
          to do when you want to do it.

                         RICK
          Haven't gotten laid yet, huh?

                         BOSHANE

                         (DISPIRITED)
          It's a lot tougher than we thought
          it would be.
          Just then Gary comes around a corner.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          105.

                         GARY
          Hey, dudes, there's like ten very
          bangable chicks out on the back
          deck--let's go!
          Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER.

                         LEARY
          To freedom!
          The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck.
          A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and
          pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he
          OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH

          LEIGH.

                         LEIGH
          Hey, where are you going?

                         RICK
          What are you doing...? I thought
          you'd left.

                         LEIGH
          No. I told you, I just had to talk
          him off the ledge. I calmed him
          down and sent him on his way.

                         RICK
          Oh. Uh, great.

                         LEIGH
          So where's that game room? I
          thought we were gonna play some
          games.
          She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go...

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Rick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens
          the door and flips on the light.
          THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a
          bar, and a bed.

                         LEIGH
          I'll be right back--I just have to
          use the bathroom.
          Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears
          into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it.
          Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the
          hallway and pushes open a door.

          COAKLEY (O.S.)
          Hey.
          REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small
          study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap
          and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          106.

                         RICK
          Hey. How come you're not downstairs
          partying?
          Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile.

                         COAKLEY
          All partied out, pal.
          Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the

          TV.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Man, that Barney Fife still kills
          me.
          He looks back to Rick.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Hey, I was thinking about this hall-
          pass business. It's really ironic,
          isn't it?
          Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned.

                         RICK
          How's that?

                         COAKLEY
          Well think about it. There's two
          kinds of guys who cheat on their
          wives: The guy who does it behind
          her back, and a guy like you who
          has his wife's permission.

                         RICK
          Well it's not really cheating if I
          have permission.

                         COAKLEY
          Yeah, whatever. The point is, if
          you asked a hundred people who the
          better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em
          would pick you, because you're
          being honest--there's no deceit
          involved.
          Rick is growing uncomfortable.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          But the funny thing is, the other
          guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he
          has to live with all that guilt and
          anxiety, while his wife's running
          around happy as a clam because she
          doesn't know anything. And you, the
          good guy, you've got no guilt at
          all because you just laid it all on
          your wife's shoulders.

                         RICK
          Well I didn't really think of it

                         LIKE--

                         

                         

                         

                         

          107.

                         COAKLEY
          It's like she's your guilt Sherpa!
          Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates.

                         COAKLEY (CONT'D)
          Funny, huh?

                         RICK

                         (WEAKLY)
          Yeah.

                         COAKLEY
          And that, my friend, is why you are
          a genius.
          As Rick lets this all sink in, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Paige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are
          crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of
          wine and sits beside her.

                         FRED
          Cheers.
          They CLINK glasses.

                         AUNT MEG
          Rick, I hope you don't mind me
          tracking you down--Paige told me
          where you were staying.

                         FRED
          Please. Not at all.

                         AUNT MEG
          You've been very sweet to her.
          Fred waves her off.

                         FRED
          Hey, she's a good kid. I do what I
          can for the kids.
          Aunt Meg moves in a little closer, squints at him sweetly.

                         AUNT MEG
          She told me everything. And I have
          to say, I was very impressed.

                         FRED
          Hm?

                         AUNT MEG
          I know she tried to hook-up with
          you--twice in fact--and that you
          set her straight both times.
          Fred hadn't heard this from Rick and is a little confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          108.

                         FRED
          Uh...hook-up?

                         AUNT MEG

                         (SMILES)
          Rick, enough with the chivalry.
          Paige wanted to sleep with you and
          you didn't take advantage of her.
          I'm just saying that's very cool.
          He shrugs modestly.

                         FRED
          Well... she's a kid and kids get
          crushes. I remember in tenth grade
          I had the biggest crush on my
          French teacher--thank God Mr.
          LeClaire was professional enough to
          only date seniors.
          Meg GIGGLES.

                         AUNT MEG
          I'm serious, it takes a certain
          kind of guy to say no to a
          beautiful young girl like that--
          especially since you have your
          wi e's permission now.
          Meg shoots him a knowing smile and puts her glass down.

          AUNT MEG (CONT'D)
          I like that, Rick. You have morals.
          She leans in and KISSES HIS NECK. Fred glances down at her
          breasts.

                         FRED
          Hey, all you have in this world is
          your word.
          As Aunt Meg CLIMBS ON TOP OF FRED, we

                          CUT TO:

          INT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - GAME ROOM - NIGHT

          Rick ENTERS to find Leigh playing a pinball machine. Leigh
          turns and smiles at Rick.

                         RICK
          Leigh, I gotta split.

                         LEIGH
          What?

                         RICK

                         (NERVOUS)
          Yeah, I kind of hit a wall.
          She can hardly believe her ears.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          109.

                         LEIGH
          Really? Are you feeling okay?
          You're not mad because I went
          outside with my friend, are you?

                         RICK
          No, no, no. Look, I shouldn't be
          doing this. I have.. .you know,
          commitments.
          Leigh nods at this, then unties a shoulder strap and her
          DRESS FALLS TO THE FLOOR. Suddenly she's NAKED before him
          and she's PERFECT.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (WEAKLY)
          Um, you dropped something.
          For a moment nobody moves. We can almost hear Rick's heart
          beat. Then Leigh STEPS CLOSER to him and Rick instinctively
          leans back.

                         LEIGH
          Relax. Don't think so much. You're
          gonna have your wife for the rest
          of your life, but tonight. . .you
          have me.
          Leigh smiles. And it's the kind of smile you only get two or
          three times in your life, if you're lucky, and probably never
          from a woman this beautiful.
          She reaches down and UNBUCKLES HIS PANTS, then she PULLS OFF
          HIS SHIRT. They stand face-to-face now, the middle-aged guy
          and the young beauty, and it's happening exactly the way Rick
          had hoped it would, the dream.
          She presses her body against his and STARTS TO KISS HIS NECK,
          her hand DISAPPEARING SOMEWHERE BELOW HIS WAIST. Then she
          leans her head AGAINST HIS CHEST. As he looks down at her,
          we PUSH IN on a suddenly conflicted Rick.

                         RICK
          Nope. I can't do this.
          He reaches for his shirt.

                         LEIGH
          What are you doing?

                         RICK
          I'm sorry.
          She stares at him, confused, as he buckles his pants.

                         LEIGH
          Your wife didn't give you a hallway
          permission slip, did she?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          110.

                         RICK
          Yes, she did, but... look, you're
          insanely beautiful and
          pathologically sexy and every cell
          in my body is telling me to dust do
          this, but--
          Rick points to his chest.

                         RICK (CONT'D)
          See this area, this spot right
          here? The first time Maggie and I
          slept together, back in college,
          she fell asleep right here. And she
          left a puddle of drool. And it
          didn't bother me. It actually felt
          good. That's when I knew I was
          going to marry her.

                         (BEAT)
          And when my kids--Emma and Gunnar--
          when they were babies, this is
          where they slept. Or sometimes at
          four o'clock in the morning Emma
          would just lay there and stare up
          at me. It was where we first got to
          know each other.

                         (BEAT)
          So I'm sorry, Leigh, but as amazing
          as I think you are...I gotta go
          home.
          Rick shrugs apologetically.

                         LEIGH
          Well, I think you have a screw
          loose and you're probably going to
          regret this for the rest of your
          life, but. . .right on, man.

                         RICK
          Um...do you want me to give you a
          ride home?

                         LEIGH
          No. It's only one-thirty--I'm going
          back down to the party.
          Rick raises two fingers.

                         RICK
          Peace it.

                         LEIGH
          R-O-C-K in the U-S-A.
          As they smile at each other one last time, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. FRED'S MINIVAN - NIGHT

          Rick is pulling away from Coakley's house when the car phone
          RINGS. Rick pushes a button to ANSWER.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         RICK
          Hello.

          MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

                         (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
          Yes, is this Fred Searing?

                         RICK
          Oh, uh, no, I'm sorry, he's not
          here right now. I'm using his car.

          MAN'S VOICE (V.0.)

                         (ON SPEAKERPHONE)
          Well, would you know where I could
          find him? This is Sgt. Polisner of
          the Massachusetts State Police.
          As Rick grows alarmed, we

                         CUT TO:

          INT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

          Fred is still on the couch with Aunt Meg on the floor in
          front of him. Fred's PANTS ARE DOWN TO HIS ANKLES, leaving
          him with only his boxers on. Meg KISSES HIS CHEST and
          STOMACH, then leans back and TAKES OFF HER TANK-TOP,
          revealing EXTRA-LARGE BAZOOKAS stuffed into a slinky bra.

                         AUNT MEG
          I'm attracted to men with
          integrity.

                         FRED
          Thanks--wow, you got great jugs.
          Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his
          pants still at his ankles), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN.

                         AUNT MEG
          Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh?

                         FRED

                         (SHRUGGING)
          Well, I grew up in the midwest.
          She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his
          pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on.) Meg TACKLES him
          and the two of them start to roll around UNDER THE COVERS.
          An O.S. Fred seems to be working his way down her stomach.

                         AUNT MEG
          Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you
          to make love to me.
          Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and
          Meg come up from under the covers. (Fred is at waist-level on
          her.)

                         RICK
          Fred, I need to talk to you!
          Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          112.

                         AUNT MEG
          Fred? I thought you were Rick?!

                         RICK
          I'm Rick.
          Fred cowers guiltily.

                         FRED
          Please don't judge me.
          As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face, we

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

          Fred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick
          on his heels. Fred has BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE stuffed up his
          nose.

                         FRED
          What did they tell you? Is Grace
          gonna be okay?

                         RICK
          All I know is she was in a car
          accident and they rushed her to the
          hospital.

                         FRED
          Oh my God...
          Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and

          REACT.
          THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can
          see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been BASHED IN
          by the BAT-WIELDING Wannabe. On the side of the vehicle is
          spray-painted: HORNY OLD MAN.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Whoa!!! What the hell...?!
          Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face.

                         WANNABE
          How do you like me now, Splenda-
          boy?

                         FRED
          You moron, that's Lny car! His is
          the one next to it!
          Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and
          quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN
          TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF

          THE PARKING LOT.
          BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR

          BREATHS.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          113.

                         RICK
          Nice job, Fred.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

          The mini-van blows by a sign that reads 'CAPE COD - 60

          MILES.'

          INT. MINI-VAN - SAME

          The WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back Rick and
          Fred's hair as if they were on a motorcycle. Fred tries his
          car phone as he drives.

                         FRED
          Oh come on! How can a hospital not
          have a live operator?!

                         RICK
          It's four in the morning, Fred.
          Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel.

                         FRED
          What was I thinking?! I had a great
          wife--a beautiful wife--and now I
          may lose her.. .because of you.

                         RICK
          What are you talking about?! You
          said our wives were living their
          dreams, with their fancy gas ovens,
          and that our dream was the hall
          pass! How can you blame this on
          me?!

                         FRED
          I'd never even heard of a hall pass
          until you flaunted yours in my
          face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a
          hall pass--everyone should have a
          hall pass!' You ruined my life,
          Mills!

          Maggie and Rick Coleman sit on the back deck DRINKING WINE.

          This is a great place.

                         MAGGIE
          Yeah, my family's had it since I
          was a kid. We used to come for a
          week a summer, then two weeks, then
          a month, then by the time I got to
          high school we were living here all
          summer long.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Something's wrong here, Maggie.

                         MAGGIE
          Hm?

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Something's wrong with a guy who
          would leave a woman like you alone
          for this long.

                         MAGGIE

                         (UNCOMFORTABLE)
          Well, you know...I did give him a
          hall pass.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          So what? If you were my girl, I
          wouldn't have taken it.
          An awkward moment. Rick touches her hand and Maggie looks
          away.

          RICK COLEMAN (CONT'D)
          You deserve way better.

                         MAGGIE
          Uh, in Rick's defense, he didn't
          really even want the hall pass. I
          kind of forced it on him.

                         RICK COLEMAN
          Why would you do that?
          Maggie thinks about this.

                         MAGGIE
          I don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          I guess I felt like he wasn't
          noticing me anymore. j guess I
          wanted to feel.. .desired again. And
          the truth is, in my heart, I never
          thought he'd go through with it.
          He brushes her hair from her face and they look into each
          other's eyes. He leans in and she does, too, and right when
          it looks like THEY MAY KISS, Maggie hesitates as suddenly

          EVERYTHING BECOMES CLEAR TO HER.

                         MAGGIE (CONT'D)
          Oh my God...

          What?

                         MAGGIE
          This hall pass ...it wasn't for him.

          blamed you for this. I'm the one
          who dragged you into this thing.

          No, you didn't. I went willingly.

          I've been bad, Rick. I've been real
          bad.

          shouldn't have run from you guys,
          but my wife's been in an accident

          to the Doctor, who seems very serious.

          Please tell me she's gonna be okay.

                         DOCTOR
          She is. Your wife broke her nose
          and she got shaken up a bit, but
          all in all she's a very lucky
          woman.

          You got that wrong, doc. I'm the
          lucky one.

          Fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye.

          and I'm gonna go home and take care
          of mine.
          Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other,
          unmoved. Rick starts to walk away.

          Rick stops and turns at the door.

          What are you talking about? We were

          You were my first. And you were my
          last. And you were everything in

          So...is that why you were crying
          that first night?

                         (NERVOUS)
          Well...I was upset so I went for a
          drive--you know, to think--and I
          must have hit a patch of sand, and
          before I knew it I was into the

          Fred stops and looks her in the eye.

                         FRED
          I'm sorry, Grace.

          For what?

                         FRED
          For putting you through all this.
          Grace looks awash in guilt.

                         GRACE
          It's not your fault, Fred.

                         FRED
          Yes, it is--of course it's my
          fault. This isn't you--driving
          around all night, thinking--you're
          not a thinker.
          When she looks up at him, he forces a smile. But she doesn't
          smile back.

          Look, Fred, we have to talk
          about... about what happened this
          week.
          Fred takes a DEEP BREATH and looks around, trying to avoid
          the moment.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          121.

                         FRED
          Grace. . .do we really have to do
          this?
          Grace lowers her head guiltily.

                         GRACE
          Yeah. Yeah, we do.
          When she looks back up, she NOTICES the SPRAY-PAINTED and

          BATTERED MINI-VAN.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          Horny old man?

                         FRED

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          Oh, no, honey, that's not me--they
          were talking about Rick.
          Grace looks at him, confused. Suddenly Fred falls to his
          knees.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          Look, all you gotta know is that
          whatever happened doesn't matter! I
          love you and only you! And I'm
          going to treat you like the queen
          that you are for the rest of your
          living days, so help me God! I'll
          mow the lawn, I'll shovel the snow,
          I'll wash the stubble off the
          sink...
          Grace looks down at him.

                         FRED (CONT'D)
          .But please, I'm begging you,
          sweetie... can we please just never
          talk about what happened this week?
          Grace's eyes flicker about, hardly believing her luck.

                         GRACE
          Um...deal.
          Fred gets up and THROWS HIS ARMS AROUND HIS WIFE.

                         GRACE (CONT'D)
          I love you, Fred.
          As they embrace, Fred sees Rick come out the front door with
          his arm around Maggie. Fred shoots Rick a THUMBS-UP.
          CLOSE ON RICK AND MAGGIE as they smile at Fred and Grace.

                         RICK
          Come on, you two! We're gonna go
          watch the sun come up!

          FADE IN:
          BLACK. It's everywhere. It swallows the screen. And so we stare
          into a sea of BLACK.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          I saw a severed head once. Except for the,
          paleness, it looked healthy, well-fed.
          The end came abruptly you could tell
          'cause the mouth froze in mid-sentence.
          "Shh.  ," the curled lips attempted. Like
          it started saying "shucks" or "Shirley"
          or... "shit happens." Your eyes don't
          forget things like that. Like you don't
          forget the sound animals make when
          they're humping. Primal.
          Raw. They endure
          in you forever because the senses have a
          brain all their own and they recall long
          after you've succumbed to the la-la of
          forgetfulness.
          (a pregnant beat)
          Sometimes when it's dark out,-so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.

          (BEAT)
          And it starts all over again.
          From this blackness, a streak of LIGHTNING splits the night sky.

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

           We are in the eye of a STORM, an angry mass of clo uds raging
          o f a howling WIND. across the black sky..It brings RAIN and THUNDER an d the swirl
          An ENTITY emerges from this moist darkness.
          weather and advances into our scope of visibilityies through the
          A FLASH, of lightning erupts and it illuminates the sky. We SEE
          the approaching entity as it hovers before us.
          It's a man.
          It's a man, plus.
          It's a SUPERHERO,
          garbed in an elastic dark-grey outfit - a faded RED CAPE extends b
          ehind him, thrashing against the wind and rain.
          This Superhero (30). Unshaven.
          Disheveled. Worn. A face
          chiselled with mileage.
          

          

          2.
          In the eyes, we can see his soul. Intense. Fierce. An exposed
          nerve, snagged in a fish hook.
          He hangs in the air, tired, rain-soaked, pissed-off.
          He stares down at the earth below and he beholds the saturated
          visage of SHEEPSHEAD BAY, a seaside Brooklyn neighborhood.
          And from the bowels of his very soul, this Superhero belches a
          thunderous ROAR. He pivots in the air and dives toward land.
          He slices through the downpour, arms extended, body erect,
          engulfed in the dimensions of his cape.
          The ground approaches, fast. He accelerates as if to embrace it.
          Velocity sucks up all remaining space and there is IMPACT.
          An EXPLOSION as he rips through the street surface, penetrating
          the asphalt - head first. Debris and concrete spew from the
          ruptured orifice as he disappears inside.
          There is an expulsion of subterranean pressure and it launches
          nearby manhole LIDS from their spots - they bounce and CLANG
          down the street like loose change.
          The rain continues its onslaught.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Rain sloshes against a kitchen window. Where the sink is. Not
          far from the kitchen table. Where the LONGFELLOW Family sits,
          dinner before them.
          HORUS (35) leans over his plate, eating his meal. Here idles a
          man of diminutive frame, bespectacled, placid - as harmless as
          low fat milk.
          He sits opposite MARY (30), frenetically appropriating food. A
          gentle beauty. entwined in maternal angst she is estrogen with an
          attitude.
          A meek little AARON (8), slouches between the folks - a BLACK
          EYE tattoos the left of his face. Aaron stares at the damn
          plate, finding no humor in eggplant.

          MARY
          The principal did'nothing. Like
          schoolyard terrorism is no worse than
          being tardy. What's the matter with
          education? Back when, you could go to
          school and learn about Betsy Ross and...
          mollusks and... not get stabbed on the
          way home.

          INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - NIGHT

          A subway TRAM idles by a passenger ramp. STEAM hisses from its
          side and plumes into a wall of white mist.
          And from this cloud of angry vapors, a figure appears. He
          surfaces from the dark subway tunnel, a cool nonchalance in his
          gait.
          It is the Superhero, his identity safely concealed under the
          collar of a tattered TRENCHCOAT. He traverses the loading deck,
          PASSENGERS boarding and disembarking around him.
          He wades through them - to a deserted section of the subway. He
          strolls over to a CIGARETTE MACHINE, up against the grafetti-
          raped subway wall.
          On the wall, a line of profanity declares that...

          "YOUR MOTHER TAKES IT UP THE ASS."
          He surveys the machine. His right arm appears from the coat
          pocket. Fingers merge into a tight fist. And casually, he rips
          into the metal vendor like it was Jello.
          His fist withdraws a handful of bills, coins. He pockets the
          loot. He reaches back in and withdraws a carton of LUCKY STRIKE.
          Deposits it under his coat.
          And with that, he heads for the stairs - to the flooded streets
          above.
          At the ramp, and on cue, the subway tram closes its doors.
          Trembles. Moves. Steams into the deep dark tunnel. White SMOKE
          mushrooms from its tail. It lingers in the air as we...

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          see STEAM, rising from a faucet of running HOT water.
          It rises from a sink of soiled dishes - where Mary deposits
          another set of pots. She's clearing the table.
          Down a dark hallway, a streak of light escapes from an open
          door. Inside and on the bed, the frail posture of Horus changes
          out of his clothes.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus disrobes down to his t-shirt and briefs. He stands before
          the closet mirror, scrutinizing the emaciated, sand-kicked-in-
          the-face body.


          5.
           Horns strikes
           a He-man pose, his
           biceps in the
           wind.

           He removes the Police apparel,
           plastic. Proceeds to put it on.

   
          INT. RED


          EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          FISH
          How the fuck can I help you sir?


           SUPERHERO
          A room.
     

          

          6.
          His blood-shot eyes mean it.
          Fish turns to the back wall. Grabs a random KEY from a nail.

          FISH
          Top floor, 7F. Fifteen a pop, up front.
          (re: the check-in sheet)
          And your John Hancock makes it sweet.
          The Superhero scrutinizes the CHECK-IN sheet. Scribbles

          HANCOCK
          on the dotted line.
          Fish hands over the key. Then, pulls it back from Hancock's
          grab.

          FISH (CONT'D)
          I don't take messages, I don't do favors,
          and I don't know you from Jack. You want
          sheets, they're extra. Towel's extra.
          Plunger's extra.

          HANCOCK
          I need quiet. Is it quiet?

          FISH
          Quiet? Hey pal, we look like a public
          library to you? The girls work. Some of
          them scream, some of them moan...

          (SMILES)
          and some of them just kinda lay there
          cold. You want quiet, I got cotton balls
          you can stick in your ear. They're extra.

          Hancock eyes Fish, mentally dissecting the vermin with his bare
          hands. He withdraws from his coat the WAD of loot. Pushes it
          under the window.

          And while Fish collects, he leans into the window and emits a
          deep GROWL. Fish recoils. The bills fly.

          Hancock takes the key. Exchanges it with a metal ORB - the
          strangulated remains of the bell. It rolls out of his palm and
          CLINKS off the counter.
          Hancock sidles off. Fish - the cat's got his tongue.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Horus, in full uniform - dark blue pants, shirt.

          

          

          

          

          7.
          He dips into a dresser, pulls out a thick black leather belt -
          complete with holster.

          Horus returns to the dresser for one final item - It's obscured
          by his arm but we feel it to be some heavy chunk of metal.
          He confronts the mirror, twirls this piece, holsters it. And we
          SEE it to be a FLASHLIGHT.
          A shoulder patch reads...

          U-RENT SECURITY CO.
          Their motto: "TO OBSERVE AND RECORD"
          Horus tucks a hat under his arms, ready to move.

          INT. AARON'S ROOM - NIGHT

          A jar of MARBLES rests upon a window ledge. Outside, the story
          is rain.
          On a bed, sprawled on his back, Aaron gazes up at the empty
          ceiling - the black eye squats prominently on his face.
          Aaron brings his hand before his eyes. Looks at it. Studies it.
          Slowly, his fingers converge into a tight FIST - a boy's
          interpretation of a man's weapon.
          A gentle KNOCK disperses the knuckles. Horus peers in.

          HORUS
          How's the eye?

          AARON
          Black.
          Horus enters.
          Stands awkwardly before his son.

          HORUS
          It'll be gone in a week. Mom'11 touch it
          up with some make-up and you won't even
          know it's there.

          AARON
          Yeah I will. And I don't want any girly
          make-up on my face.
          Horus deposits himself on the bed. Hunches over-h13 knees.

          

          

          

          

          B.

          HORUS
          (almost apologetically)
          There'll always be people around
          who'll... exert force over those of us
          who just want to live in peace.
          Aaron listens, observing his father's efforts.

          HORUS (CONT' D)
          (pain in every word)
          The thing to do is... to avoid them.
          They're no-wins. Can't-wins. You hold the
          anger... and move on. You hold the anger.
          (turns to Aaron)
          I tell you because I can't take it,
          seeing you hurt. You're part of me.

          (BEAT)
          I've felt what you're feeling now. And if
          you've got any of me in you, you're gonna
          feel what I felt-when you go up against
          one of 'em. Turn away... that's what you
          do... the other cheek. You do that for
          me. No, you're not the coward. Not you.
          No. I'll be the coward, all right? 'Cause
          I don't want to see you hurt. I love you.
          I ask you to do that for me... your old
          man.
          And while he utters these words, Mary watches from the dark
          hallway - moved b y his affection.
          She oversees a father-son embrace.

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          I'm late for work. Get some sleep.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          .after a good night sleep.
          The light FLICKS off and the man's silhouette form exits the
          room.

          INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

          Horus backs his way out. Shuts the door. Mary's hand greets him
          from behind.
          It startles the man. He.tries to regroup.

          HORUS
          Mary.

          

          

          

          

          9.
           Mary inches closer - passion oozes from every pore. She nestles
          up against her husband.
           Horus stands uncoordinated, pressing his hands against her back.
          He is gentle, but as effective as an armless masturbator.
           Mary caresses his neck. Moves her lips to his ear, enraptured

          BY
          the moment.
          And out of nowhere...

          HORUS (CONT'D)

          (AWKWARD)
          I'm late.
          Mary snaps from her trance. Unshackles her hold, like she almost
          expected it.

          MARY

          (DISAPPOINTED)
          Right.

          (BEAT)
          Coffee's by the door.
           She marches back into the kitchen. Horus stares at his feet.
          S hakes his fists, mentally kicking himself in the face.
           He settles for the door, grabs hisjac ke , coffee thermos. A
           look at Mary and he's out thedoo rt

           And while the storm rages outside, Mary burns in a feverish
          sweat. The swelling steam and running ho t water combine to
          saturate her chest and face - she drips.
           Mary gazes out at the wet abyss, possessed by some inner
          longing.

          INT. MOTEL ROOM (7F) - NIGHT

          A T.V. SET. It MOANS from the corner of a room. Scant
          blinking red neon from the street cannot disguise thecant lighting
          torture this r oom has seen.

          

          

          

          

          10.
          Torn, mildewed' curtains. Damp carpeting,. et _ d by every form
           of bodily discharge. No self-rem nï¿½ g maggot would want to be
          caught dead here.
          On a shredded s, blotched with urine and cum, we SEE a
          trenehc -lï¿½n open carton of cigarettes accompanies the
          picture.
          An open door faces the MOANING TV set. It's the bathroom and
          it's occupied by the intensely frazzled image of Hancock.
          He squats on the TOILET, pants around the ankles, cape shrouded
          around him.
          Those unforgiving eyes plant on the TV screen, a cigarette
          dangling from the corner of his lip.
          We discern the MOANS to be human and we SEE that he is watching
          a PORNO flick - flashes of flesh upon flesh in a fucking frenzy.

          T.V. SET (O.S.)

          (FEMALE)
          Ooh yeah, big fella. That's it. Shoot
          your load, baby. Let it fly... FLY...!
          (male; in ecstasy)
          fly. YES! G0000D!
          Hancock absorbs the action from the can, a glint of pain on his
          face.
          He takes a long hard drag on the cigarette - a full stick
          deteriorates into ashes before our eyes.
          And outside, it rains like there's no tomorrow.

          Morning brings a cease-fire on precipitation. The streets

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL (7F) - DAY

          An ASHTRAY buried under a mountain of butts.
          A bed unslept. The TV is on, commercialing some spring-fresh
          vaginal wash. The room sits empty.
          But the bathroom door is open. Inside, the supersuit peeled down
          to his waist, Hancock shaves.

          HANCOCK
          (mumbling; rehearsing)
          it's about responsibility... with
          what is empowered in you... to correct
          the ills of man.
          No foam. No gel. Just skin and the razor edge of his belt BUCKLE
          - it slices through stubble, clearing up a face that has yet to
          sleep.

          Hancock reaches into the cabinet below the sink - pulls out a
          BOTTLE of 409 all-purpose cleaner...
          On the tube, the commercial segues way into...

          T.V. (O.S.)

          TV Rips it from the wall, throws it out the window. And a CRASH
          eradicates images of war and chaos.
          He returns to the bathroom. To the mirror. Proceeds to spray his
          teeth with 409...

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - DAY

          Behold this imposing, block-long behemoth of commerce and
          decadence. A shopper's wet dream, this is WATANABE'S SHOPPING

          EMPORIUM.
          From the street, notice the display windows - all mannequins
          come complete with outfit and ultra-erect nipples.
          As EMPLOYEES file into the service entrance, out comes Horus and
          Roheim. They head streetward, to the sidewalk.
          Roheim unscrews the battery cap from his flashlight. Takes a
          swig from its hollow interior.

          ROHEIM
          I'll just play out the rest of this Eight
          Ball...
          He laps up the last drop. Reloads it with a couple of batteries
          from his jacket.

          ROHEIM (CONT' D)
          (caps it)
          like that.
          Horus looks on - silent.

          

          

          

          

          14.
          A POLICE VEHICLE enters this urban landscape. It slows in front
          of them. The cops: RUTGER and ADAMS, two hairy-knuckled
          testosterone cases with nothing to do.

          RUTGER.
          (passenger seat)
          Boys...
          The cops smile at one another. A large SHOTGUN rests fully erect
          between them. And they drive off.
          Horus, watching them go, focuses in on the

          "TO SERVE AND PROTECT"
          of their vehicle.
          Roheim watches him - turning red with drama.

          ROHEIM
          Bastards... couldn't protect a pitcher of
          warm spit... couldn't find their
          asshole with common sense and a thumb.

          (BEAT)
          Like I been saying, it's their.loss. The
          jerk-offs, they don't got the heart...
          the sensitivity of a man like you.
          Horus tries to shrug off these words. No good - they stick like
          a thorn in the eye of his soul.

          ROHEIM (CONT'.D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Come on, let's go home.

          EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY

          On the rooftop; the Red Eye Motel.
          A trenchcoated figure - we see him from the back, only. We
          recognize the broad of his shoulders and the red of his cape,
          peering out from a hole in his coat.
          A cloud of smoke lingers above his head, from an unseen
          cigarette. He stands before the Sheepshead neighborhood, ever so
          still.
          Something brews within this superman.

          The streets of Sheepshead: apartments, brownstones speckled with

          are the "esque" in Bro ly qu
          Through this hustle-bustle, we spot Mary and Aaron on their way

          TO

          BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
          Schoolyard activities abound. Buses, bouncing balls, and hoards
          of screaming little anti-christs.

          Mary leads Aaron along the playground fence, the latter trying
          to pull ahead and away.

          MARY
          Will you slow down.

          AARON
          I know it. I know it.

          MARY
          I think I'm... slow down... I'm gaining
          weight. Honey, take a look at my waist.

          AARON
          What?

          MARY
          Is my dress too tight?

          AARON
          What? Nothing. It's fine.

          MARY
          Really, my waist isn't too big?

          AARON
          What? Not here, mom.

          MARY
          All right, already. Two-thirty. You do n't

          AARON
          (there is no god)
          Geez!
          He turns back. Plants a kiss on Mary's smiling cheeks.

          MARY
          Two-thirty.

          AARON
          All right, mom.
          He leaves, merging into the undulating sea of children.

          MARY
          (after him; in vain)
          You want anything from the store?
          He's gone.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          This is the Longfellow's street - lower-middle class but
          comfortable, quaint, safe. Mr. Longfellow, hustling through the
          street, takes us home.
          Greeting him at the entrance, at the mailboxes, is CLYDE BANNER
          (35). Quite large this tenant is, quite simply a Cro-Magnon Man.
          Clyde stands with the morning paper in hand, searching
          carelessly through. He finds the SPORTS PAGE. Hides it under his
          robe.

          Clyde shoves the remains of the paper at Horus - in his face.

          CLYDE
          Picked this up for you.
          (pulls the paper back)
          Say thanks.

          HORUS
          Thanks.

          He heads inside.
          Horus swallowing it. He unshuffles the paper, finding the front
          page. The headline reads...

          RAINSTORM HITS SHEEPSHEAD. NO END IN SIGHT.
          Horus checks the sky - a sinewy mesh of angry clouds. He lumbers
          inside.

          She continues her way, purpose in every step. No window shopping
          bullshit for this woman - Mary's strong, beautiful.
          She crosses the street, her destination: CENTRAL FIDELITY BANK.
          A dark CHEVY eases pass Mary on this street, pulls to a stop.
          Mary continues forth, entering the bank.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Sheepshead DENIZENS crisscross amok. People queue behind teller
          lines, taking care of business.
          Mary takes her place. She glances at the bank CLOCK - it's 10
          o'clock.

          A BEE spirals the air and lands on the sleeve of a nervous ARM.
          This arm protrudes from the dark Chevy, parked before the bank.
          The engine is running.
          The arm fidgets. SHOOS the insect away. With white knuckles, it
          grips the wheel.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Same bank, same people. Mary awaits service in the same line.
          A MAN ambles pass Mary's line, up towards the front. He cuts off
          the person in front, an elderly WOMAN.

          WOMAN
          Hey, what's the idea?
          The man turns. Smiles. His smile fades, turning into a maniacal.
          grin. This man is TOM (35), as plainly evil as the eye can see.

          TOM
          You know what, you remind me of my
          grandma.
          Tom whips out a sawed-off SHOTGUN from his pants...

          Thanks, Granny!
          Of course, by now, people have realized the implications of the
          situation at hand. They begin to panic.
          On cue, two new GUNMEN, JERRY and JERRY (30's), emerge from the
          crowded bank, both revealing automatic RIFLES.
          Jerry #1 drops the SECURITY GUARD with the butt of his gun.
          As planned, they take aim at the surveillance CAMERAS on each
          end of the bank. BANG. BANG. They miss, much to Tom's chagrin.
          The crowd ducks, Mary among them. Terror grips,the queues.
          The Jerrys try again. BANG. BANG. No more cameras. And with
          ,Irâº that, Tom takes center stage. He leaps on the teller counter.

          Bradley Elementary School.
           Class.is in session, captained by ravishing MS. MILLIS (28).
          Lips, legs, lungs - stuff prepubescent wet dreams are made of.
          Aaron, nestled mid-room, tries to keep his eyes straight.
          He steals a quick look to the back of the room: there, in the
          back, a BLONDE boy (8) sits chewing gum.
          This kid, from the slicked-back hair and rolled-up t-shirt
          sleeves, is a sub-species of vermin.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BANK DAY

          Time LAPSES. It's 2:30.
          Mary turns from the clock, concerned. She studies the situation,
          the robbers - an overall glumness tells the story. At the
          entrance - Tom. He looks desperate. Irrational. Ready to snap.

          

          

          

          

          23.
          The hostages huddle on the floor, tired. They wait.

          EXT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY - DAY

          The CLOCK on the building reads 2:30 school is out. Children
          file out of classrooms. Scatter. Only Aaron remains, alone to
          the elements - waiting.
          A ball bounces, rolls to his feet. Aaron looks...
          It's not a ball. It's a doll's head.
          Aaron's face - dread.

          phone deliberating an important call.

          My koochie, woochie, oochie ooo...
          A BLAST rings out from Central Fidelity.
          Glass shatters from the entrance. A body, the security guard,
          tumbles out and onto the sidewalk.
          Blood and brain exits in OOZES where the bullet had entered -
          he's probably dead.

          

          

          

          

          24.
          The cops, Ted., Chad. Rutger and Adams - they all REACT, guns
          raised.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom huddles by the entrance, gun smoking. Cool and suave has
          succumbed to psychotic. The Jerrys are nearby, nervous. As are
          the hostages, clumped together in fright.

          TOM

          (SNAPPED)
          I'm not gonna say it again, Ted!
          (re: hostages)
          swiss cheese. All of them!

          TED (O.S.)
          Time's running out, fellas!
          The hostages grimace, hell not so far away.

          TOM
          I want that car, Ted!

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Ted punches Chad on the shoulders.

          TED
          Where's that car, Jesus!

          CHAD
          It's out getting your pizza.

          TOM (O.S.)
          . a car and I want it NOW!
          And on this cue, the sky answers with a thunderous surprise - a
          CAR comes CRASHING down before the bank entrance.
          It came from the clouds and it looks familiar - it's the getaway
          Chevy, bruised and punctured beyond recognition, its hubcaps
          still reeling from the impact.
          The sky answers again, this time with the tattered body of FRED,
          the getaway driver (alias, the arm.) Fred lands on the hood of
          the Chevy, sinking into its metal frame.
          SHOCK waves across faces of stone. The cops all look up.

          TED
          (at the sky)
          What the...

          

          

          

          

          25.
          There :;n the sky, a taped figure works his magic of flight. He
          examines the ground below. And he dives.
          Hancock approaches earth and swings lateral. He circumvents the
          bank structure, flying around and around.
          Everybody ducks. Trash and paper batter about behind his draft.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Tom and the Jerrys stand shackled in their spots.
          Their eyes wander about, lost in confusion. The WHIR outside
          subsides. Stops.
          A loaded beat.
          Tom, in mid-swallow, watches as a spectacular EXPLOSION of
          bricks sprays the air inside. A caped figure bursts into the
          scene amidst SCREAMS from clueless hostages.
          in the blink of an eye, Hancock has Jerry #2 by the collar. With
          a flick of the wrists, Jerry #2 is a human projectile en route
          to the windshield of a police vehicle outside.
          Jerry #1 opens FIRE on Hancock. Bullets careen off flesh of
          steel.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          Jerry #1 rides air and glass out and across the street into
          another awaiting police windshield.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          Smoke and debris smother the air. And as they subside, all eyes
          fall on the caped figure that is Hancock, erect in the rubble.
          Mary can't believe her eyes. She surveys every inch of his
          frame, now clean-shaven, combed, comic book perfect.
          Hancock scans the crowd of stunned hostages - his eyes pick out
          the WOMEN - Veronica's wet smile takes him.
          A heartbeat.

          HANCOCK

          (GOD)
          Everybody out, please.
          Bodies bang about, all moving for the door.

          

          

          

          

          26.
          Mary follows the herd out but her eyes remain on the caped
          figure, until real estate ushers her into the street.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          PARAMEDICS converge on the hostages .
          The cops are at a loss - deers staring down a pair headlights.
          They train their guns on the bank, waiting for answers.

          INT. BANK - DAY

          The bank floor in shambles. No one in sight. But movement jars
          us to the back, where the bank SAFE is.
          We SEE Hancock wade through rubble towards the open safe, a
          thick steel chamber of commerce. Hancock arrives at the safe.
          Confronts the object inside - Tom.

          INT. BANK SAFE - DAY

          There he is, in the corner, a sweaty piece of misery. Tom bears
          his revolver, aimed at Hancock. Hancock enters the safe.

          TOM
          Stay away.
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I'm not going back.
          Hancock turns, grabs the safe door. Slams it shut with a
          resounding THUD. They're locked in.

          TOM (CONT'D)

          (HYSTERICAL)
          What're you doing?
          Hancock does not respond.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          What's going on, here?
          Hancock no response. Tom raises his gun, and meaning it.

          TOM (CONT'D)
          Answer me! Say something!

          (FIRES)
          Fuck me!

          

          

          

          

          27.
          BANG! Tom fires a. shot off Hancock's forehead. The BULLET
          ricochets about the steel interior, under great velocity.
          It rips Tom's right EAR from his head.

          HANCOCK
          (catching the renegade slug)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Tom retrieves his ear from the ground. Tries to put it back,
          clutching his head. He bleeds.

          TOM
          Fuck... My shirt.

          HANCOCK
          (steps forward)
          Why don't we call it the day.

          TOM
          (gun raised)
          Don't. I told you... I'm not going back.

          HANCOCK

          (IRRITATED)
          If you're going to tease, cock the damn
          gun. Otherwise, spare me the wounded
          animal act of desperation. I don't got c,
          time for rhetoric and sympathy so. don't
          expect... dialogue and "come with me and
          you won't be hurt" bullshit. You walk out
          of here with me and your life is a
          violent storm. You will be hurt, you will
          be abused... whatever turns them on.
          Either way, your days are shit! Those are
          the realities, spelled out.

          TOM
          What's eating you, man?

          HANCOCK

          (UPSET)
          You got half the precinct out there,
          armed, trained to blow the tail off a
          sperm from a hundred yards... you're
          standing in here, cornered, three bullets
          left in that squirter of yours, if you're
          lucky, and you got one ear. I don't need
          the aggravation. I don't need this.

          TOM
          Man, you're jaded. I'm not asking for a
          rainbow...

          you don't got to shower me with respect.
          Just a little.. tenderness, is all. Have
          you no mercy, mister?

          HANCOCK
          (he's had enough)
          I'm all out. Let's go...
          And as he utters this, he approaches Tom.

          TOM

          (HURT)
          Fuck you.
          Close on his trigger finger. It tightens...

          HANCOCK

          NO!

          INT. BANK - DAY

          On the bank floor, where a group of cops now huddle, we hear
          THREE SHOTS - from the safe.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          The schoolyard - it looms in the background, as a reference to
          where we are.
          Aaron occupies this alley and we see what he sees - trash and
          fire-escapes and ominous gray skies. DARK FIGURES move into this
          sight - they eclipse the heavens.
          And there Aaron is, twisted in a contorted heap of arms and legs
           - his body eternally locked within the stranglehold of SPENGLER
          and ERLICK (both his age.)
          Aaron's face, another BLACK EYE makes it a set. Rage distorts
          his mouth out of symmetry. He stares at PERCEVAL, before him -
          the blonde kid from class.
          We HEAR water, a stream of liquid-something SPLASHING about,
          SPRAYING. Perceval - he's taking a leak on Aaron's exposed leg.

          EXT. BANK - DAY

          The aftermath.
          Hancock is swarmed under MEDIA LIGHTS, reporters squeezing
          through a wall of people, police, trying to get a piece of this
          superman.

          

          

          

          

          29.
          We follow Hancock's scope amidst the melee it spots luscious
          Veronica again, it spots WOMEN, all who'd die for a chance to
          suck on his cape.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Mary hastens after Aaron, urine-soaked and on the verge of
          tears. He rages down the street while his mother pursues.

          MARY
          Tell me... what happened?

          AARON
          (about to break)
          You were late.

          MARY
          I was held up...

          AARON
          The asshole peed on me. I'm dog shit.

          MARY
          .at the bank. Honey, were they the same
          ones? Don't cry.

          AARON
          Get a grip, mom.
          They arrive home, both storming through the entrance and up the
          stairs.

          EXT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door SLAMS to signify arrival. School books go flying.
          Mother and son march down the hallway. They are greeted by
          Horus, sleep still on his face.

          HORUS
          How was your day?
          Mother and son - if eyes could disembowel.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. BUILDING - DAY

          Just your average professional building, several stories of
          brick and cement.

          

          

          

          

          30.
          But all is not well with this typically normal picture. On the
          top floor, outside and on the ledge - a JUMPER stands poised
          before blood and concrete. His TIE flaps in the wind.
          From an adjacent window, a SECRETARY, a FIREMAN attempt to get
          him down.

          JUMPER'

          (SELF-PITY)
          People ignore me.
          From his vantage - a congregation of PEOPLE swarm below in his
          honor. A woman cradling a BABY watches from a building window
          across the street.

          FIREMAN
          Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          (through her teeth)
          You're not unattractive.

          FIREMAN
          Baldness is not fatal.

          JUMPER
          My wife ignores me.

          FIREMAN
          Your wife's a cunt, Mr. Fisher.

          SECRETARY
          We like you, Mr. Fisher. The girls
          acknowledge you, we all do.

          JUMPER
          No.

          SECRETARY
          Yes.

          JUMPER
          Really?
          The secretary SCREAMS. All attention shifts to the BUILDING
          across the street. The secretary points...

          EXT. OPPOSITE BUILDING - DAY

          There...

          

          

          

          

          31.
          on the top floor, outside and on the ledge - the baby seen
          earlier, diaper-clad, crawls precariously on the rim of doom.
          His mother's FREAKING from the window.
          Below, the crowd makes its way across the street. They point and
          gasp at the infant's every movement - leaving the jumper by his
          lonesome.
          The baby teeters along the edge. It heads for a FLAG pole,
          dazzled by the red-white-and-blue. It reaches out at fabric.
          Almost. Not quite. The baby DROPS from the precipice.
          On the street, people CHOKE on their tongues as gravity pulls
          the infant down.
          But wait... Hancock swoops out of the thin blue, swift and
          silent. He cradles the baby from utter concrete.
          He deposits the youngster with.the ecstatic crowd - they, of
          mostly the FEMALE persuasion, all form around the savior.
          We SEE in the background and across the street, the Jumper nose-
          diving into the sidewalk - without much fanfare.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          An apartment building engulfed in FLAMES. FIRE TRUCKS don't even
          bother with the hoses - it's too late. Around them, TENANTS
          bemoan the loss of...
          Like a wrecking ball, Hancock BURSTS through the burning rubble
          and surfaces clean on the other side of the building.
          Blanketed under his cape are two little TODDLERS, and a young
          WOMAN in bra and panties. He lowers them to safety.

          We're in the hallway. Where Horus kneels. He's bent listening
          into Aaron's bedroom, in his security clothes. By the TV and in
          her apron, Mary watches the news...

          NEWS

          astonishment.

          Let me see your eye...
          (to Mary)
          I told him about the other cheek. Avoid
          confrontations... to turn the other
          cheek.

          .He did. He turned the other cheek and

          Horus finds his hat on the table. His eyes fall on Mary, her
          back to him. She's glued to the set.

          HORUS '
          How... what about you?

          MARY

          (ALOOF)

          INT. BROWNSTONE - NIGHT

          A room, a place we don't know. It's dark save the street light
          outside. A rhythmic POUNDING reverberates through this darkness.
          More intense it becomes.
          And then a high-pitch GASP. Two individuals, man and woman,
          stumble into view - their silhouettes obscure the window.
          They're locked at the hips, pumping away like high-revving
          pistons.
          For a second, light dances off the woman's aroused face: it's
          Veronica.

          VERONICA
          (a her voice trembles)
          Oh god.
          The man surfaces from her cleavage for air, his face wet with
          sweat and saliva. He brushes his cape away from his arm.
          Veronica uncoils yet another orgasm, her back arched, her
          breasts beckoning at ceiling.
          Quite abruptly, he lets her go. Rights his pants. Unlatches the
          window. She paws after him.

          

          

          

          

          34.

          VERONICA (CONT'D)
          What'd I do?

          HANCOCK

          (DEJECTED)
          'Nothing. I'm sorry.
          And with that, he floats out into the night.

          VERONICA
          (dazed; after him)
          Hancock.

          EXT. STREET - NIGHT

          Horus. His walk. Unaware of everything but the storm inside his
          head.
          He crosses an alley. A band of THUGS, neighborhood kids of
          malcontent, surprises him. And. versa. They recoil at his
          uniform, his gun.
          They quickly realize that he's rent-a-security.
          The leader speaks first - he's SCARPO (25), as tough as a steel-
          belted radial. The others regroup their DRUGS.

          SCARPO
          Nutri-cop.
          Horus keeps walking.

          SCARPO (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Look like the Man. Walk like the Man.
          Shit, ain't half the Man.

          OTHERS
          Ain't half the Man.
          Horus simply walks away.

          EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

          A streetlight HUMS. Blinks - revealing a deserted alley in'
          sporadic intervals. Garbage, etc.
          A slight drizzle shimmers pass the streetlight. Pelts a soulful
          Hancock below - he moves through the gray dreariness in
          solitude.

          

          

          

          

          35.
          He reaches behind his e. withdraws a box of cigarettes.
          Taps himself a stick.

          VOICE (O.S.)
          How about spreading some of that joy?
          Hancock turns and faces a young HOODLUM, scraggly in his own
          slimy kind of way.
          In a huff, he shoves Hancock up against the building. Presses a
          gun to Hancock's temple.

          HOODLUM

          (PSYCHOTIC)
          Better yet, why don't I just take it...
          Hancock - enraged. In a caffeinated blink, he has the Hoodlum by
          the throat via one arm, the gun with the other.

          HANCOCK

          (SUPER-PSYCHOTIC)
          What are you thinking?
          The Hoodlum notices that he's dangling a foot off the ground -
          one of his SNEAKERS remains in its spot from the swift jolt.
          The other sneaker teeters on his one foot... and falls to the
          pavement.

          HOODLUM
          (fuck me)
          Shit...

          HANCOCK
          What are you thinking?!
          Hancock wrests the gun from his hand. Places it into his own
          mouth. FIRES two slugs inside. The Hoodlum FREAKS.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D )
          Huh?!
          Takes the smoking gun out of his mouth. Shoves it up the-
          Hoodlum's nose.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          Want to see brain? Huh?!
          Sticks the gun back into his mouth. FIRES another shot inside.
          Takes it out and this time - jams it into the Hoodlums mouth.
          The Hoodlum proceeds to urinate in his pants.

          

          

          

          

          36.

          HOODLUM
          (with his mouth full)
          Please, mister. I got a baby coming.., a
          wife. I got student loans...
          Hancock - intense.
          Is this getting through?

          HOODLUM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          please. Have a heart, mister.
          Hancock - the fire inside subsides. Cools to a rational state.
          He lowers the. Hoodlum.
          He spits the three SLUGS into his hand. Deposits them in the
          Hoodlum's breast pocket. Walks away.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          In the closing hours of business, employees pell-mell about in
          preparation for departure.
          A group of LADIES form around a display T.V., taking in with
          frothy wetness every inch of Hancock's footage. They gasp
          amongst themselves.
          Horus enters the picture, jacket and thermos. He notices the TV -
          it's like he can't escape the good news.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The TV set.
          More news on the day's activities. Mary sits mesmerized on the
          sofa, holding a dish she had planned to dry.
          Aaron surfaces from the hallway, lured out by the TV He comes up
          behind Mary - his black eyes on the news.

          MARY

          (SURPRISED)
          You're still up.

          AARON
          Can't sleep.
          He rolls over the sofa, next to his mother.
          They watch VIDEO clips of the foiled bank heist: the crashing
          Chevy, the aerial maneuvers, the sheer invincibility of this
          man.

          MARY
          There's something about him... I don't
          know.
          A female REPORTER concludes the footage...

          REPORTER

          (FAINTLY)
          And so we ask... who is this man?
          Speculation abounds - government super-

          extraterrestrial renegade? Who are you?
          Where are you now, superguy? Call me.

          (SMILES)
          We'll get together. Have a drink.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          HADES - a smoky bar in the armpit of town.
          NEON beer signs. POOL tables. CIGARETTE machines. This is home
          to mean people, tough guys - children of a fucked-up god.
          We cut through the nicotine air to find the bar. A figure
          hunches on the far end, smoking. Popping vodka like mountain
          water in Dixie cups.
          It's Hancock and his trenchcoat. The long day wears heavy on his
          face - those perpetually red eyes, the horror they've seen.

          HANCOCK

          (MUTTERING)
          What he's got to do... a man's got to do
          it.

          EXT. BAR - NIGHT

          Hancock stumbles out, incognito, frazzled under his guise. Up
          above, the sky - so dark under the storm clouds.
          We HEAR commotion in the side alley. And so does Hancock. He
          peers into the alley.
          There, by a lighted PHONE BOOTH, a WHORE is fending off a horny
          JOHN. Hancock simply watches she drives her knee between his
          legs. He drops. SQUEALS like a little girl.
          The John finds a two-by-four in the dirt. He reaches for it...

          

          

          

          

          38.
          A COUGH stops him - it's Hancock and he discourages further
          violence.
          Up and out of the alley, the John flees - tail, between his
          legs.
          A long stare ensues - Hancock and the Whore, looking into each
          other's eyes for answers.
          The Whore approaches him. Touches his face - studies it. Moves
          it into the light.

          WHORE
          (the sage)
          You've been to Hell, it looks. And you're
          tired...

          (BEAT)
          and in need.
          Hancock - his eyes agree.
          The Whore lifts her skirt, reaching into her panties. She takes
          out a MATCHBOOK.
          Hands it to him.

          WHORE (CONY' D)
          My business card.
          (to the phone booth)
          My office.
          Hancock inspects the matchbook - 555-GINA, etched inside.

          HANCOCK

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          From the black night - a dark figure plummets, caroms off the
          side of a building, strikes the metal fire-escapes, crashing
          into the trash cans below.
          Hancock stumbles from the wreckage, the garbage. Falls. He leans
          against the building, glazed over with drunkenness.
          He turns to the only source of light that of a building across
          the street: KILLYBEGS TEXTILES, looming above the rest. Boarded-
          up windows indicate abandonment - an urban relic.
          He stares at the building - perhaps sparing more attention than
          we think it deserves.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary swallows. Starts in on the tune.

          MARY

          There, on his ass, his head a raging inferno - Hancock listens,
          as if he can hear.

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Aaron, succumbing to his mother's song - his lids flutter.

          Something overcomes this fevered superman. He begins to unravel.
          A calm consumes him. Tames him. It could be Mary's voice - maybe
          he can hear it, and then maybe not.

          MARY (V.O.)
          "Golden slumber fills your eyes. Smiles
          awake you when you rise."
          Hancock wavers on consciousness - quite unlike him.

          "Sleep pretty darling, do not cry. And I

          Erratic traces of an urban landscape JAG about.
          Aaron's distorted view of his neighborhood comes sharp and in
          flashes as he is pursued by his tormentors.
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They chase him from behind, HOOTING,
          taunting poor Aaron - they're out for blood.
          Aaron cuts into an alley, lungs pumping...

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          .. but a brick wall stares him down, providing no exit. He
          swallows hard.
          FOOTSTEPS approach, just seconds away. Close on Aaron, as blood
          drains from his face. His eyes dash for a garbage CAN - but is
          there time?
          Spengler. Erlick. Perceval. They can smell their prey.

          They turn the corner, attack mode. Aaron, nowhere in sight. Just
          the brick wall and a trash can.
          They converge, baffled. Erlick inspects the solid wall. Spengler
          scratches his head. But'Perceval's no fool. He spots the trash
          can.
          He motions the fellas over. They circle the can. A beat. They
          ATTACK... an empty can. No one inside. Nothing.
          That's because above them, no strings and no cables, Aaron
          hovers - under Hancock's capable arm.
          In mid-air, they hang for a second. Then, Hancock takes them
          away.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          Mary stands at the designated pick-up spot, pacing like her

          A secluded view of the city, high above. Hancock, Aaron under
          his arms, rides a light breeze - and then lands.
          Aaron scampers away. Turns and faces the man.
          Hancock examines the boy's face, the black eyes. He shakes his
          head. Disappointed.
          He reaches for his belt. Pulls out a cigarette. Lights it.

          HANCOCK
          You smoke?

          AARON
          What?

          (beat; takes a puff)
          Smoke no evil.
          Hancock moves over to Aaron, now backed in a corner.

          it. Doubles over, coughing.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Good, huh? Tastes like compost... your
          first stick. Then, after a few more... it
          starts getting this. flavor. A little
          nicotine buzz. A while passes and all of

          now, it takes a whole pack to get
          there.., and you won't settle till your,
          mouth's as sweet.

          Principles?

          Principles. Here's one; very simple. Just
          about all you need to know: a man's got
          to do what a man's got to do.
          (beat; smokes)
          I look at your face, the shiners. You
          took a shove and you let it go clean. Not
          good. That's a formula for future
          abuse... an invitation to the loser's
          dance. Letting it go. Walking away.
          ,(shakes head)
          Bad policy. Won't be long 'fore you're
          running, looking for a place to hide.

          AARON
          What am I suppose to do?

          HANCOCK
          You do what is necessary.

          What is necessary.

          Let me tell you something, kid. There was
          this infantry unit, you see... badly
          outnumbered.
          (thinks about it)
          Wait, let me put it in kid terms. So you
          relate, OK? There's a fox, you relate? A
          fox and he's walking through what, the
          woods, the forests, right? Next thing the
          fox knows, he's staring down a pack of...
          hounds. Bloodhounds. And there's this
          chase, the fox's running his ass off,
          over boulders and through streams and,
          but the damn hounds are still on his
          tail. Finally the fox comes to this
          cliff, a precipice... and it's what, a
          seven hundred foot drop onto jagged
          rocks. He's in trouble 'cause the hounds
          are closing in and they're going to tear
          him to pieces. So what does he think...
          "I jump and I die for sure. I stay,
          confront them and I'll get my ass
          butchered." Decision time. He thinks,
          "stay and least I'd have something, a
          chance.

          (thinking about it)
          He gets away.
          Hancock inhales what's left of his cigarette. Blows smoke.

          HANCOCK
          No. The fox gets his ass kicked and
          some... I mean ripped apart by the dogs,
          like cheap fabric.

          AARON
          What're you saying?

          HANCOCK
          But you know, when the last hound was
          through with him,-and he's walking away,
          he hears this noise. It's the fox and
          he's muttering something under his
          breath... words. The dog goes over. Gets
          up close. To hear what he's saying. You
          know what the fox's saying... just before
          he keels off?
          Aaron - negative.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Now he's gurgling, choking on his own 
          blood, right? A massacre. The fox's lying
          next to his entrails, you know... and you
          know what he says?
          (raises his fist in the air)
          "No regrets."

          AARON
          What?

          HANCOCK
          No regrets. You make a decision and you
          stick to it. Like a man's got to do. And
          "no regrets."
          Aaron - submitting it to memory.

          AARON
          Why're you telling me all this?

          

          

          

          

          45.

          HANCOCK
          (a beat to think)
          Look at it this way... I got to do what I
          got to do.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Through the street darts Mary, eyes berserk in search for herher
          son. She looks at her watch. And up... up ahead, by steps
          apartment - Aaron, levitating in air.
          Hancock explains this defiance of gravity. He gently lowers
          Aaron on the sidewalk, before his mother.
          She beckons him. Like a shield, she envelops him with her arms.
          She stares up at Hancock - her eyes, stricken with fear. Or
          possibly, they were awestruck.

          INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

          Close on a TV set, featuring a COMMERCIAL - in mid-hype. A
          portly man states his purpose.
          His name tag reads - DR. HOLE.

          Hancock staring into footages of bedlam, bloodshed. From the TV
          set, maternal CRIES spew forth grief and anguish.
          Hancock grabs the remote. Fumbles around for the power button.
          He pumps the volume instead - the WAILS intensify his state of
          panic, pain.
          CLICK. Mary - by the tube, switches off the mayhem. She studies
          his reaction, now marked with relief.

          MARY

          (SAVIOR)
          Are you OK?

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY

          (NERVOUS)
          I came in to... hope you like chicken.
          Hancock nods, watching Mary as she retreats into the kitchen. He
          continues to stare - at Mrs. Longfellow, in frenetics, prepping
          for dinner.
          She catches him looking... looking surreal, this superman, there
          on her sofa.
          A calm, while they stare. And then...

          AARON (O:S.)
          Table's done.
          Mary turns to Aaron, offscreen.

          MARY
          Glasses.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Geez.
          Horus enters from the hallway, disheveled from sleep. He does
          not see the superman on his sofa. He continues into the kitchen.

          

          

          

          

          47.
          Mary stares at him. Aaron appears, also staring at him. Horus
          does a "what?" with his shoulders. Mother and son gesture behind
          him.
          He turns and beholds: Hancock,' rising in full garb, arm
          extended. All eyes on Horus - befuddled.

          MARY
          You know Hancock?

          AARON
          He comes for dinner.
          Close on Hancock. Close on Horus.

          HANCOCK
          Man of the house?

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Dinner is served. All the key players, present. Horus sits
          facing his son - dethroned by the distinguished visitor. Mary
          serves.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          Which piece would you like?

          HANCOCK
          Breasts, please.
          Horus, watching everything - Mary and her every blush.

          AARON
          You want milk?

          HANCOCK
          No. It gives me gas. Thank you.
          A beat - as everyone visualizes a superFART.

          AARON
          It makes mom fart, too.
          Mary CHOKES on her food.
          Drops her fork. She maneuvers, in the allotted space, for the
          utensil - and finding difficulty.
          Hancock grabs the table, one arm. Lifts it off the carpet and
          above everyone's head. Mary, startled, impressed, all of the
          above. She picks up the fork.

          HANCOCK
          not about the labor... or the love of
          it.
          (beat; we've heard this before)
          .It's about responsibility... with what is
          empowered in you. The gift of might.
          Might to.do what? Exploitation, because
          you can? Or a different path. To purvey
          justice. To correct the ills of man...
          because I can.
          Faces of profound confusion - Mary and Aaron. But they are
          charmed, his words secondary to his charisma.
          Horus, the quiet observer, observes.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          so, a job? Yes. And no. It's about...
          essence. The essence of the man... not
          his clothes. It's the job. Take away the
          arm,. the leg..., his bodily possessions
          but not his trade, his profession. That
          case, you strip him of what he is... a
          man.
          Horus a firm grasp of the concept.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)
          What line of work are you in, Mr.
          Longfellow?

          HORUS
          (clearing throat)
          Oh, it's not like you... what you do or
          anything. A department store over on
          Third.

          MARY
          Horus is in the securities business.

          HORUS
          I'm a security guard. I'm just...

          

          

          

          

          49.
          Aaron rises from the table. Goes over to the fridge.

          MARY
          It's a large department store, over a
          couple million in merchandise... stereos,
          jewelry. On three floors.

          HORUS
          It's a night job. I sit around.

          HANCOCK
          You're a security guard. You keep the
          state of things. It's a job. You do it.

          (PAUSE)
          We're in the same business.
          Aaron returns with the ketchup bottle.
          A frozen moment while Horus ponders the implications. He stares
          at the BOTTLE.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Aaron, could you show me the restroom?
          Aaron points first door in the hall.

          AARON
          On the right.
          He leaves to find bladder relief - leaving Horus to his family.

          AARON (CONT' D)
          What do you think, mom?

          MARY
          (in a whisper)
          Horus, what do I do?

          HORUS
          (at his watch)
          I need to get ready.

          AARON
          mom?

          MARY
          (to Horus)
          What do I do with him... when you're
          gone? I have to entertain this super...
          She doesn't finish her... A NOISE interrupts her - seizes the

          It comes from the bathroom - the sound of PISS, urine versus the
          surface tension.of water.
          LOUD. WET. A turgid firehose at full blast. The force of
          urination grips the room - as powerful as the penile mechanism
          from which it is generated.
          The toilet FLUSHES. Hancock returns to a'room of astonished
          faces - mouths agape.

          INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

          Later,. by a few minutes.

          HANCOCK
          (lost; sombre)
          and you could see the flames, through
          the storm... I get there, the vessel's
          all over, spread across three miles of
          South Pacific. Bodies floating in the
          water, shoes, kids who'd thought it some
          routine reconnaissance joyride. Turns
          out, the only one alive was the captain,
          up against a buoy... crying 'cause he
          didn't go down with his men... and he's
          got to live with it.

          (BEAT)
          Sprayed his brain all over the dashboard
          in a parking lot a couple months after. A
          good man...
          (at Aaron)
          . did what he had to do.
          A brief moment while the graphics sink in. No one talks. Aaron's
          smitten. Mary, a mixture of repulsion and fascination.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen, in the sink, stacks of plates indicate that
          dinner is through.
          Company has moved into the living room, with the exception of
          Horus. Aaron kneels besides Hancock. Mary, across from him.

          AARON
          (making a fist)
          I wanted to kill him.

          MARY
          Aaron.

          

          

          

          

          51.

          AARON
          I want to deck him, just once. So bad I
          tense up... like I can't even move.

          MARY
          (to Hancock)
          He comes home crying.

          AARON
          Did not. Not crying. It was pissed-off.

          HANCOCK

          (REACTS)
          No... there's no shame in it. The crying.
          It's relief...
          (to Mary)
          we're older and we don't remember
          when... we go, "God, when was the last
          time?" Maybe it's me. It's more an
          effort, now. Takes more pain... more
          blood. Like it's, do you have the time
          anymore? Even to look back and recall a
          moving experience. To be moved.

          (AARON)
          By rage. Hurt.

          (MARY)
          By love.

          (BEAT)
          But if you have to remember the last time
          something touched you... you've missed it
          - you've forgotten how to cry.
          Horus enters the room, Mr. Security Guard. He observes this
          magic Hancock works over his wife and kid - a talent whose
          nature he has yet to comprehend.
          Horus opts to not disturb their trance. He makes for the door.
          Hancock - holds him accountable.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (AWARE)
          Mr. Longfellow. I'll be leaving, too.

          HORUS
          Oh, I... you don't have to leave. I don't
          want to interfere. I have work.

          MARY
          (the original sin)
          Oh, I forgot to make coffee.
          She rushes into the kitchen. Horus stops her.

          

          

          

          

          52.

          HORUS
          It's all right, Mary. I'm late.

          MARY
          No, I'll make it right now.

          HORUS
          I don't have time. I'll grab some on the
          way. Thanks.
          Mary accepts it - not entirely guilt-free.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          I don't want to interrupt. Please don't
          let me stop you.

          HANCOCK
          No, I need to go.
          (at' Mary and only Mary)
          The last time I had a meal... an evening
          like this, I was... it was too long ago.
          I appreciate your kindness.

          MARY

          (AWKWARD)
          Please... you're welcome, here. Anytime.
          Horus watches everything - watching her chest heave under
          Hancock's every word, watching his wife slip away.

          HANCOCK
          Aaron. Tomorrow. After the bell. I'll
          drop by after school. See how you're
          doing.

          AARON

          (SMILES)
          Yeah.
          Horus watches this - his son slipping away.
          The two men leave, Hancock ushering Horus out first.
          Mary closes the door behind them. Leans against the door and
          EXHALES - a sign of relief, of despair, or, of a heart raging
          wild.
          We just .don't know.

          

          

          

          

          53.

          EXT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The two men appear from the entrance, shoulder to shoulder -
          sort of. They enter the street.

          HORUS

          (POINTING)
          I'm this way.
          Hancock points the opposite way.

          HANCOCK
          Need a lift?

          HORUS
          It's a short walk.
          Acknowledged.
          An awkward beat while they stare at each other...
          . until finally, they go their separate ways - Horus via walk
          and Hancock, with effortless grace,, via flight.
          From the sidewalk and awe-stricken - Horus watches Hancock merge
          into the blackness. A look of dread squats on his face.

          Of course he does.

          RUTGER
          Of course.
          Holly returns with the coffee. Hands it to Horus - free of

          INT. AARON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Mary's folding clothes by the dresser, busy with thought. Aaron
          squats on the bed, his brain going a mile a minute. He plops
          back against the bed. Brings his hand up to his face. Makes a
          fist. Thinking. Wondering.

          MARY
          What're you doing?
          She's taken by this scene.

          AARON
          (releases fist)
          Thinking.
          Mary goes over to the bed. Sits.

          MARY
          About him?

          AARON
          No. Not really. Are you?

          

          

          

          

          56.

          MARY
          No.
          They're lying through their collective teeth.

          AARON
          Me neither. I was thinking.., about
          tomorrow.

          MARY
          Go to sleep. You know what dad says.
          Tomorrow always feels better...

          AARON
          I know, mom... after a good night sleep.
          He says that but he's the one working
          every night. Does that mean he never
          feels better? He's always feeling
          terrible?

          MARY

          (AMUSED)
          Go to bed, anyway.
          She tucks him-in.. Turns off the lamp. And as she's out the
          door...

          AARON
          Mom?
          She turns.

          Time lapses into the late hours. This town experiences a serene
          moment - a peacefulness which says that this as night as a night
          will be.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          Looking down aisles of merchandise - not a trace of life and not
          unlike a cemetery.
          All is dead, with the exception of FOOTSTEPS - shoes pacing
          linoleum. It's Horus, on duty. His flashlight leads the way...

          Outside, the SIRENS of police vehicles charge by - real men en
          route to real work.
          Horus watches them from the window - like a kid who can't come
          out to play.
          He turns to look across the floor - Roheim, against a chair,
          watching the NEWS on a big-screen TV

          EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT

          It's dark out here in the night. On the roof. Overlooking the
          community, the Longfellow's apartment building... and Mary's
          bedroom.
          From here, we can SEE her - entering from the hallway. She
          disrobes down to bare back...
          And from this darkness, the RED tip of a burning cigarette GLOWS
          into view. Hancock watches from here, the cigarette BLAZES back
          towards his face intense.

          A foreign TERRAIN of trees, of lakes so clear and blue.
          They pass below us as we soar through air and mist...
          the mist clears, thrusting us into the dense foliage of a
          JUNGLE. We penetrate the silence
          the silence, it fades into SONG - the silk, mellifluous
          voice of a woman (not unlike Mary's). Her siren call beckons
          us... takes us deeper into unknown greenery...
          but the sound of crackling GUNSHOTS punctuate the end to
          song. SCREAMS and CRIES rise from the smoke, women and children
          in hysterics...

          we quicken to a frantic pace, slicing through the growth.
          Rocket and mortar shells EXPLODE in our path, splitting trees
          and earth...
          . we remain undaunted... but the WAILS of suffering
          continues...
          until we get there, there in a clearing as smoke and debris
          settle... and we see the remains of a lake, a,lake full of
          BLOOD... of mangled BODIES floating like flotsam... WOMEN and

          CHILDREN... DEAD...
          . we SCREAM!

          INT. RED EYE MOTEL - NIGHT

          Hancock bolts from his bed - horrified, eyes cracked with red
          veins. He is soaked.
          The orgasmic SCREAMS of a prostitute seeps through from the
          adjacent motel room -.the wall behind Hancock's bed trembles to
          the rhythm of each pelvic thrust...

          Consciousness slowly sinks in. He checks his watch, then the
          area around him. He spots Horus - slumped in a chair, in a
          thinking posture.
          Horns seems lost in his own blank stare.

          A deserted street at this early hour. On the curb and by
          themselves - Horus and Roheim, ruminating.

          ROHEIM
          . that look on her face, you know the
          look, when she's almost there... makes
          you feel like a man.

          and it's not my hand that's touching her
          and it's not even me, my body. Some guy,
          this good-looking guy... he looks like
          the Marlboro Man, only shirtless. And
          so... the Marlboro Man's running his
          fingers through her hair. And he's...
          banging her... and her knees... by her
          ears, you know?
          (beat; cringing)
          And that look on her face. That look.

          Mary and Aaron - they exit, surprising Clyde.
          Mary gestures at Clyde, pointing an accusing finger. She seizes

          No.

          You're afraid to offend. You don't want

          Hancock warbles out from the debris - his trenchcoat reduced to

          MARY
          What were you doing in the street?
          (the trenchcoat)
          You ripped it pretty good.

          It'll be all right.

          HANCOCK
          All right?

          MARY
          It's just the seams. I can sew it back.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          MARY
          (the trenchcoat)
          This. It's just the seams.'I'll take good

          You'll sew -it?

          MARY
          Yes. Me. I can. And I'll re-button it for

          Hancock acknowledges with a smile - a slight one.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          Mary stands alone on the sidewalk, looking up at heaven. Her
          eyes search the gray sky for signs of life.-
          There, overhead - a DOT. It grows in size, getting closer and
          arriving fast... and gradually, it shapes into Hancock.

          

          

          

          

          65.
          He swoops into view, straight downward. Pulls on the air brakes
          and eases into a soft landing - by Mary's side.
          He is wet from his flight and his hands, 'we notice, are cupped
          together tightly.

          MARY
          (like a little girl)
          Let's see.

          HANCOCK
          You have to be quick.

          MARY
          Come on, I want to see.

          HANCOCK
          If you blink, you'll miss it.
          Hancock uncups his hands, releasing a billowy MASS of white
          something - it hangs in the air, and then dissipates into
          moisture. It showers into his open hands.
          Mary reaches for it. Too late.

          MARY
          I saw it, right? A little cloud.
          She peers into his hands - where only a pool of wetness remains.
          And with her fingers, Mary reaches inside to feel the rain.
          Hancock watches this - the innocence in her face, as her hand
          touches his.
          He stares down at her hand... at the wedding ring. Mary-pulls
          her hand away.

          MARY (CONY' D)
          The water is dirty.

          HANCOCK

          MARY

          HANCOCK
          I'm sorry.

          MARY
          (into his eyes)
          It's not your fault.

          

          

          

          

          66.
          Hancock looks away.

          MARY (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You're tense.

          HANCOCK
          I've been tired, lately.

          MARY
          You should slow down. Rest.

          HANCOCK
          -So people tell me.

          MARY
          (heat; upon some thought)
          It must be hard.

          HANCOCK
          Hard?

          MARY
          To always do right... do good when all
          you want to do is rest.

          HANCOCK
          It's harder to not do anything. What am
          I? It's not for me. It's for... it is
          about people. Rest? When there is
          despair? I cannot. I bring relief. I am
          relief. You know that instant, that split
          instant of time when you realize that the
          nightmare... the totality of fear
          itself... that it's all been a bad dream?
          That it's safe? That is relief. The
          infant in my arms... to the hysterical
          mother. When you can see her face, what's
          rest? It is self-indulgence.
          Mary - in some advance stage of "wow."

          MARY
          Where... who are you?

          HANCOCK
          It's not important who I am, Mary. Or
          what... where I'm from. It doesn't
          matter. I'm a man. I am every man.

          

          

          

          

          67.

          MARY
          (sizing up his words)
          You probably get a lot of practice
          explaining yourself, on account of who
          you are and what you do.

          HANCOCK
          Why... do you say that?

          MARY
          It's like, everything you say sounds...
          so perfect. Like you rehearse them so
          they'll be that way. I mean, not to say
          that it's insincere...

          (BEAT)
          I mean, maybe it's something about you
          but... it must be hard on you sometimes.
          Hancock stares at his feet, perhaps reluctant to answer.

          MARY (CONT' D)

          (APOLOGETIC)
          But probably not... probably..

          HANCOCK
          Yes...
          (pulling teeth)
          sometimes.
          Mary allows the moment to sink in.

          MARY
          So, you never answered. Back there...
          what were you doing in the middle of the
          street?

          HANCOCK

          (THINKS)
          I was lost...

          (EXHALES)
          . but I think I'm ok, now.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Trash cans fly. Paper, swept up and sent aflutter. We've seen
          this before - Aaron, running for his life and the bullies in
          pell-mell pursuit.
          He cuts into an alley. Looses them momentarily. Finds a DUMPSTER
          to his liking.

          

          

          

          

          68.
          Erlick. Spengler. They zoom by and with great eagerness.
          Perceval strolls after them, too cool to sweat.
          From the dumpster, little Aaron watches them... looks
          relieved... until conscience kicks in. A moment to reflect, he
          takes.

          AARON

          (HANCOCK)
          " before long, you're running, looking
          for a place to hide."

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Erlick and Spengler - at a dead end. Their trail leads them to a
          metal FENCE, the alley continuing beyond it. No time wasted
          they scale it.
          Perceval arrives - in time to see Erlick, landing on the other
          side. Spengler pulls himself over. Joins Erlick on the ground.

          PERCEVAL
          Shit, I'm not climbing this. Just combed
          my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler turn to him, through the metal bars. Their
          eyes are of disbelief.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          What's up?
          (checks his hair)
          What?
          Perceval follows their gaze behind him to Aaron, shivering
          with clenched fists.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          (rolls up sleeves)
          I just combed my hair.
          Erlick and Spengler make for the fence, to join the fray.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Don't bother. He's mine.
          (to Aaron)
          No biting. I hate biting.

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.

          ERLICK

          (OVERLAPPING)
          Do him, Percy. He's your woman.

          PERCEVAL
          Let's go. Let's have it. While we're
          still kids.
          Nothing from Aaron - just a lot of balls.

          PERCEVAL (CONT'D)
          Dick wad, let's go. Come on, you impotent
          little gonad.

          (BEAT)
          Your mother chokes on big, hard, veiny,
          purple-headed shlongs the size of...
          All Aaron needs to hear. He charges - comatose.
          And the pummeling begins. Perceval dictates the assault, landing
          BLOWS to the face and body.
          Aaron - doing an impression of a punching bag. He wafts at air,
          left and right...

          ERLICK
          He's yours.

          SPENGLER
          Save some for us.
          Someone blinks - and Aaron finds himself on the dirt, supine.
          Perceval looms over him, silhouetted against the sky.
          He reaches for his zipper, doing that Perceval-thing. A look of
          recognition in Aaron's eyes - it's going to rain soon.
          He reacts with knee-jerk reflects, administering a swift kick
          into Perceval's peeing apparatus. A faint SQUEAL eructs from the
          fellow's mouth. He drops like a wet tea bag.
          Erlick. Spengler. Shock. Disbelief. Aaron gets to his feet,
          ready to book... but he doesn't. He stays.

          ERLICK
          What's he doing?

          SPENGLER
          Kick his ass, Percy.
          Aaron stares at them, behind the fence. Then down at Perceval
          fetal position, mouth agape. Aaron reaches for his zipper ZIP,
          revenge presents itself.

          ERLICK
          That's cold.

          

          

          

          

          ?0.

          SPENGLER
          Kill him, Percy.
          Aaron cranes himself over Perceval's face, over his open oral
          orifice. Contemplates his target.
          Aaron - to pee or not to pee...
          ZIP. He closes his fly. Steps away.

          AARON
          (to the boys)
          Don't mess with me.
          He struts out of the alley. Shifts into a mad sprint, adrenaline
          taking him away.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sleeps. Mary enters from the hallway, hush-hush. She moves
          to the closet. Changes out of her clothes.
          Not a stir from Horus - exercising stealth in his efforts to
          watch her, watching her sweater fall to the carpet.
          Mary stands before the closet mirror. Does a profile check. She
          reaches for her bra... and from the mirror, catches Horus
          staring,.

          MARY
          You're still up?
          She moves behind the bathroom door. Self-conscious.

          HORUS
          Just get in?
          Mary steps out of the bathroom, buttoning up her domestic
          attire. She nods affirmatively.

          MARY
          Nick's market. Are you sick?

          HORUS
          I can't sleep.
          She goes to the bed. Palms his forehead with her right. Palms
          her own with the left, as reference.
          Horus tilts his head away from her hand.

          You want some milk? I'll heat it up for
          you, how about that?

          HORUS
          No thank you.

          Aaron, today? This Hancock 's picking up

          MARY
          Yes, he is.
          He sits there in bed, struggling with the words. Mary continues
          dressing - oblivious.

          HORUS
          He'll take him home?

          MARY
          Yes.

          HORUS
          What do we know about this man? The
          papers... they don't have all the facts
          about him.

          MARY
          What facts? He's not a hero.

          HORUS
          Yes. A hero. I know that...

          MARY
          Aaron likes him.

          HORUS

          neglectful... that I haven't been

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (SERIOUSLY)
          I'm trying... you have to know... I'd
          like to be more... involved. Like it used

          MARY
          No. I have to start on dinner. So how
          about that glass of milk?
          Horus - shakes his head, annoyed.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          All right. Try to get some sleep.
          With that, she's out the door.
          Horns alone in bed, staring into the vanity mirror at his
          wretched face.
          He spots a brown paper BAG on the chair. Goes to inspect. Inside
          - Hancock's tattered trenchcoat. Oy, what does it mean?
          Horus returns to bed, distraught. He buries himself under the
          cover.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Aaron races down the. last leg of his street. On the steps of his
          apartment building - Hancock, making himself at home. Yes, a
          cigarette smolders from his lips..
          Hancock looks at the boy. They share a second of silence.
          And finally, Hancock-puts out his hand - he approves. Aaron,
          triumphant, SMACKS it for five.

          up at me, it hurt that bad.
          And while he narrates, Mary runs her fingers through his hair -
          a mother grooming her child. Meanwhile, Horus listens concerned.

          AARON (CONTD.)

          INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

          Through the dim of light - Horus, alone, prepares for work.
          A framed PHOTOGRAPH of a distinguished MAN (50's) sits on the
          shelf inside the closet - he poses in full police regalia, stern
          and proud.
          Horus pauses to acknowledge the photograph. He closes the closet
          door.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          On the kitchen floor and under the light - Mary and Aaron,
          mother giving son a HAIRCUT.

          Horus walks into the living room,. in the dark. He looks at his
          wife, then at his son - doing their own thing. They don't
          realize he's there.
          Horus leaves, the door'CLICKS shut behind him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Horus?

          AARON
          it's almost eight. Dad's late.

          MARY
          Horus?
          She brushes hair off her apron. Moves into the living room, the
          bedroom - no husband. She goes to the front door. Opens it into
          the stairway outside.
          There on the stairs and down below, Hancock stands - on his way
          up. Mary sees him... and they look at each other.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          In the kitchen and under the light, Mary. Hancock. Aaron. Mary
          is finishing up on Aaron, applying the last SNIP.

          AARON
          like this?
          (holds up hand)
          How do you make a fist?

          MARY
          (grabs his head)
          Aaron, hold it.
          Hancock shoves his fist up close, almost between the boy's eyes.
          So there it is, the fist - this petrified mass of knuckles and
          bones. It SNARLS at Aaron.
          Hancock holds it there, fingers locked together - like he can't
          let go of them.
          Aaron swallows - in awe. Mary watches her guest, the change in
          him.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Hancock?
          The sound of her voice takes him. He snaps out of it.

          

          

          

          

          15.

          Your hair. Come on, have a seat.

          Mom's going butcher your hair.

          MARY
          Shut up, kid. Hit the showers. And the n
          homework.

          AARON
          Oh, mom. I want to talk to him. Tell her,
          Hancock.
          Hancock shrugs a "what can I do."

          AARON (CONT' D)
          Yeah, right. I know. I got to do what I
          got to do.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          The Big Haircut. Mary and Hancock - up close. Mary runs her
          fingers through his hair, testing his length. She leans into
          him. SNIP, goes her scissor.
          Hancock - in his seat, as hard as marble. He seems a bit lost in
          her presence. Baffled.
          From his position, the view consists of Mary - blossoming in her
          sweater.
          And that's it. Not a word during this process - just the SOUND
          of their breaths.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Hancock.
          Erected before us, the immediate product of a mediocre haircut -
          he looks plain and un-super. He looks... goofy.

          MARY
          There... my hero.
          He inspects himself via a hand MIRROR. Smiles. Politely.

          HANCOCK
          Nice. Thank you.
          Mary - peripatetic, putting away things...

          MARY
          I started out just trimming for Horus.
          Here and there. He had to look just right
          for the academy, says his father, a
          police captain there... in Philly. When
          we moved here, I pretty much took over as
          the resident barber. You know, to save
          some money.

          HANCOCK
          He was in the-police academy?
          A pause.

          MARY
          His father's idea. Not his. He went
          through it anyway, like he had something
          to prove... the validation of his
          manhood.

          (BEAT)
          It tpok everything out of him. He didn't
          talk for days after he was cut. He took
          it real hard. I mean, still, he's not...
          I mean,, he's still...
          (edits herself)
          .it was a difficult time for hi.. Me. I
          understand that I'm not intolerant of it,
          the working-through process. It's just
          that, sometimes...
          (at Hancock)
          sometimes, I need his strength. I
          miss. the strength.

          HANCOCK
          Is that what you want?

          MARY
          Want?

          HANCOCK
          What you need?

          MARY
          The hair... I need to...

          

          

          

          

          77.
          She kneels to sweep up hair. Hancock follows her down.

          HANCOCK

          MARY
          Yes?

          You ever been down the boardwalk, at

          They're eye to eye. Close.

          AARON (O.S.)
          Mom?
          Mary bursts from her perch - regroups, awkwardly. Aaron stands
          in the hallway, his hair still wet from the shower.

          MARY
          Yes.
          Inside Aaron's head: My mother + Hancock? Nah!

          AARON
          my mouth. It's starting to swell. I
          think he loosened a tooth.
          Mary - maternal duty calls.

          MARY
          All right. Go to your room. I'll get the
          ice pack.
          Aaron exits. Mary exits.
          Hancock - alone and on his knees. He finally rises. Heads for
          the front door.
          Mary returns with the ice pack. Catches him...

          MARY (CONT' D)
          You're leaving?

          HANCOCK
          It's getting late.

          HANCOCK
          I'm going to take a walk.

          MARY
          Really? On the boardwalk?

          HANCOCK
          Maybe.
          Pause.

           AARON (O.S.)
          Mom.'

           MARY
          I'm sorry.
          She goes to him, without words to say. In this silence, he
          stares at her his eyes, glazed with thought.

          HANCOCK

          (FINALLY)
          Good night, Mary.

          MARY
          Good night.

          INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock - 9:45 pm.
          The store rests in afterhour stillness. Horus paces by the side
          door, his ears pressed to the phone receiver - no answer.
          He hangs up. Checks his watch. Goes to the front entrance and
          peers out at the street - no Roheim.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT

          The bar. The smoke. The scums of humanity. Gina - over there,
          marketing her cleavage to anything with a pulse and a penis.
          She mingles with a BAR FLY.
          Her eyes locate Hancock - entering, finding a seat.
          From an adjacent stool, A MAN places his hand on Hancock's lap.
          Whispers to him.

          

          

          

          

          79.

          MAN
          I wear dresses. How about you?

          HANCOCK
          (considers; nah)
          Get lost.
          The warning comes across quite well - the man exits.
          Gina saunters over - takes the vacancy. At the other end, the
          bar fly rises. Pays. Heads pass them, for the door.

          GINA
          (to bar fly)
          Meet you outside. The El Camino, right?
          The bar fly nods. Exits. Gina turns to Hancock. Takes his face
          in her hands, studies him.

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Your eyes are calm. It's good.
          She withdraws her hands.

          HANCOCK
          What?

          GINA
          But you're still here.
          She rises. And as she makes for the exit...

          GINA (CONT'D)
          Nice haircut.
          Hancock watches as the night swallows her whole. He inhales the
          rest of his cigarette - pensive.

          CUT TO:

           INT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          The clock, it reads 1:05 am.
          Horns, his flashlight, they're making their rounds. His routine
          takes him outside - via an EXIT door.

          EXT. WATANABE'S SHOPPING EMPORIUM - NIGHT

          A dark alley. Dumpsters. Boxes.
          Horus peruses the premises. Heads around the building and to the
          street.:.

          

          

          

          

          80.
          . as a ragged FIGURE collapses onto.him. It's Roheim and he's
          been drinking, right?

          HORUS
          Dear God.
          Horus catches him.

          INT. WATANABE'S - NIGHT

          They find a chair in the back, Horus Positioning Roheim in the
          light. The old man isn't drunk - his mouth agape, his face
          bruised with wounds from a serious pummeling.
          A chunk of lip dangles, bleeds.

          HORUS
          Jesus.
          Goes to the bathroom sink for some paper towels. Comes back to
          nurse' the wounds.

          ROHEIM
          Figured I can get you by the front... but
          you weren't there.

          HORUS
          (dabbing the torn lip)
          Who... what happened?

          ROHEIM
          They-jumped me. That bastard Scarpo and
          his boys. They were waiting on me.
          Returns to get more clean towels. And comes back.

          HORUS
          Why didn't you come through the back...
          standing out there in the dark?

          ROHEIM
          -Couldn't find my keys. Must've dropped
          them'in the fight.
          (feels his lip)
          Shit...
          He works himself off the chair. Heads inside the bathroom.

          HORUS
          What're you doing?

          

          

          

          

          81.

          ROHEIM
          (into the mirror)
          the old man
          Look at what they did.. gave
          a fat lip to match his big mouth. I'm for
          shit.

          HORUS

          (FRUSTRATION)
          Sit down
          Could you knock it off, please.
          so I can clean the cuts.
          He leads the old wretch back to the chair.

          ROHEIM
          I'm a waste of time...

          HORUS
          Stop.

          ROHEIM
          I'm too old for this.

          HORUS
          You're not old.

          ROHEIM
          What am I... I'm biologically challenged.
          Any way you look, I'm a waste of effort.

          (BEAT)

          I
           Use to be, I blame the job. The job.
           think, bullshit job. Not right for a man.
           "To observe and record..." I say, what a t's for
           the hell is DIo nly
           dogs. They got a d o o gs in t g g hisn
           reason we're he d re, we don't shit on the
          carpet.
          Horus looks away. Doesn't want to hear it.

          ROHEIM (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But you know what, Horus. That's all
          wrong. It ain't the job. The job don't
          make the man. It's me. Not the uniform.
          It starts right here... 'cause I can't do
          anything right. Fuck up my ABC's.
          (a beat; at Horus)
          But you. Why do you put up with this
          crap? A wife. A kid. There... waiting for
          you at home.
          Horus - he just doesn't know anymore.

          

          

          

          

          82.

          EXT. KILLYBEGS TEXTILES - NIGHT

          On the rooftop of this building - Hancock, on another end of a
          Marlboro. Eyes red. Hair in wet dishevelment. He's a mess.

          HANCOCK
          got to do what you got to do.
          He paces with nervous energy, pounding his fist into the other
          hand. We sense a decision brewing...

          INT. THE LONGFELLOW BEDROOM - NIGHT

          A desk clock points to 2:30 am.
          Mary - awake undercover. She twists, turns...
          A shadow engulfs the side of her wall, smothering the light in
          the room. Mary catches it. Rises above her blanket.
          What she sees - outside the window, Hancock hanging there in non-
          gravity. He stares directly at her.

          HANCOCK
          I know you're up, Mary. I know you can
          hear me. Please meet me on the boardwalk
          tomorrow morning. Nine o'clock. It's
          important that I talk to y ou, then.

          (GRAVELY)
          Please, Mary.
          And with that, he's off and away. Mary.- stunned.

          CUT TO:

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We're in the staircase - where Horus is, supporting Roheim up
          the stairs.

          ROHEIM
          They're going to can me.

          HORUS
          No one's canning anyone. No one saw us...
          watch your step... leave.

          ROHEIM
          Should be an extra key over the door.

          

          

          

          

          83.

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY

          In the kitchen, Mary and Aaron - the morning routine. Something
          is off this morning, like someone threw a wrench into the
          machinery.
          Mary appears a bit frazzled, handing her son toasts. She rushes
          back to the stove - her eggs beckoning.

          AARON
          The toast's burnt.

          MARY
          What?
          Aaron inspects his Superman lunchbox.

          AARON
          We're late... you forgot the corn chips.
          Mary serves up-the eggs - sunny side up. 1. and down... and all
          over the place.

          MARY
          Eat... and we'll go.
          (checks her watch)
          Where's your father?
          She grabs a comb and proceeds to part Aaron's hair.

          AARON
          You forgot the corn...
          (the comb snags)
          . ouch!

          MARY
          I'm'sorry, honey. I was hoping daddy'll
          be home before we leave. I'm sorry.

          AARON
          You having your period, mom?
          She responds with a brisk slap to the head... SMACK.

          INT. ROHEIM'S APARTMENT - DAY

          We enter an anal-retentively neat and manicured living room.
          Horus ushers Roheim in...

          ROHEIM
          Shoes.
          The two pause. Remove their shoes. Proceed into bedroom.

          

          

          

          

          84.

          INT. BEDROOM - DAY

          Horus sets Roheim down on the bed. Tucks him under.

          HORUS
          You're going to be okay?

          ROHEIM
          I don't know. You might have solo act
          tomorrow night.

          HORUS
          Get some sleep.

          ROHEIM
          You're a good man, Horus.

          HORUS
          (washing over it)
          I have to get home, now. I'll call.
          Roheim grabs on to his sleeve.

          ROHEIM
          You know what Olga said before she walked
          out on me? Her last words to me. She
          turned at the front door. Looked around
          the room and she says, "keep it clean."
          That's it, can you believe it? Then out
          the door.

          (BEAT)
          But like a.shmuck,.I keep the place
          spotless... in case she walks through
          that door one day.
          (at Horus; with pain)
          I don't think she's coming back.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Horus struggles homeward - his mind in a headlock with anger,
          despair, a combination thereof.
          He moves down his street. Looks ahead - where Clyde stands,
          pillaging his morning paper. Clyde Spots Horus on the approach.
          Smiles at him, with impunity. Goes back in.
          On Horus - you can boil an egg in his seething mouth.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Fist clenched, the morning paper under his arm - Horus. steadies
          down the hallway. His eyes target the door at the end of the hall, seeing red.

          

          

          

          

          85.
          He gets there, the door. He swallows. Wipes sweat off his hand.
          KNOCK. And again, KNOCK.
          ï¿½ow
          He fidgets in his spot - courage evaporating with every elapsed
          second. Until finally, Horus is a pile of dung.
          The door opens.
          And Clyde emerges, tall and ugly. He's holding up his pants with
          one and the SPORTS PAGE with the other.
          Caughtin mid-defecation, he is none too happy.

          CLYDE
          The box scores are waiting and I got an
          inch of meat sticking out of my ass. Make
          it snappy.

          HORUS
          (loosing his voice)
          I'd like my sports page, please.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          I want you to stop taking my sports page.

          CLYDE
          All right.
          Clyde closes the door. Horus - thunderstruck.
          He stutter-steps... KNOCKS...

           CLYDE (CONT' D)

           (AGITATED)
           What's the matter, you deaf? I'll stop
           taking your sports page. Now get out of
          here and let me...

          HORUS

          (INTERRUPTS)
          I want today's sports page.

          CLYDE
          You what?

          HORUS
          That there... my sports page.

          

          

          

          

          86.

          CLYDE
          What's gotten in to you? All of a sudden?
          You don't even like football.
          Horus does.not budge.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You'll get it back... after I take my
          dump.
          Clyde proceeds to close the door... but Horus interjects, his
          foot in the door.

          HORUS
          No.

          CLYDE
          What?

          HORUS
          No. I would like my sports page now.
          Please.

          CLYDE
          After I finish.

          HORUS
          I'd prefer it now.

          CLYDE
          What's eating you, Longfella? You crazy?
          Without warning, Horus wrests the sports page from Clyde's arm
          a kamikaze move, indeed.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)

          (SHOCKED)
          Give that back.
          Horns lunges at his hulking opponent, lands a punch into Clyde's
          midsection. Harmless - it tickles him, maybe.

          CLYDE (CONT'D)
          Why'd you go and do that for?
          Clyde belts up has pants. Roles up his sleeves.., and the
          massacre commences.
          He simply tears into Horus... SLOWS to the stomach... RIGHTS
          across the face. It ends quickly and without resistance - as if
          Horns accepted it as fate.

          

          

          

          

          87.
          Clyde 'kneels over. Picks up the sports page. And as if yawning,
          returns to his room.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          By the fence - Mary and Aaron.
          Mary, with a brown paper BAG, seems.distant, preoccupied in a
          far away place.

          AARON
          Are you all right, mom?

          MARY

          (DISTRACTED)
          Yeah... why?

          AARON
          You're acting weird.

          MARY
          (didn't hear)
          What?

          AARON
          I'm late for class. Go home, mom. I think
          it's time for your nap.
          Aaron leaves.
          Pensive, Mary begins her walk... to the boardwalk.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The door swings open to admit Horus - battered, enraged,
          disoriented. He confronts an empty apartment.

          HORUS
          Mary!
          A deaf ear. No one's there to console him. He storms out of the
          apartment.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          The ocean RAGES against the shore, in the distance and at some
          muffled volume.
          Up against the railing leans Hancock, and the remains of a
          cigarette. His hair drips of salt water - he's been here a
          while, one would suspect.

          COP (O.S.)
          Come back here! Stop him!
          In the background, a COP commences pursuit on a THIEF.
          The thief dashes by - pass an indifferent Hancock. The cop
          follows suit, passing by.

          COP (CONT'D)
          Stop him!
           Hancock - his gaze wavers not from the distant waters.

          EXT..STREET - DAY

           Horus stumbles. Keeps his balance. Trudges down the street to a
          corner BAR.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          The bar is empty at this hour. The chairs are up, the floor
          swept. A husky BARTENDER unloads liquor in the back.
          Horus enters. Finds a stool.

          HORUS
          Drink.
          The bartender comes out, considers this man's appearance.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Is this a bar... or what? Drink.
          (uncomfortable with his own

          RUDENESS)
          Please.

          EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY

          Mary stands there on the boardwalk, the bag in her arms.
          It's cold this morning. A little wind has picked up. And the
          clouds - they're alive, restless.
          She finds Hancock, staring at her, waiting for. her.

          HANCOCK
          Hi.

          (EMBARRASSED)
          Thank you for being here.

          THOUGHT)
          It's cold.
          Mary and Hancock - we notice, they look good together.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          (at the clouds)
          They're moving. The turbulence has
          started.

          MARY
          Tell me what's wrong.
          He points to the distant ocean - where the horizon curves into
          darkness.

          HANCOCK
          Look out there and what do you see, Mary?

          MARY

          (PERPLEXED)
          Nothing. I don't know... I don't see
          anything.

          HANCOCK
          see it,can
           It's out there. But you can't
          Y nu?
          (beat; holding on to a thread)
          And that's good, not seeing. But for me,
          I've seen it. It's where I'm from... out
          there.

          MARY
          Please, Hancock. What are you talking
          about? What's out there?

          HANCOCK
          Duty.
          (beat; at Mary)
          You ask a man, Mary, and he'll tell you.
          He'll say: "you do what you have to do."
          Or what? You let the next guy do it for
          you, if you don't... if you can't.
          (losing it)
          And... but. If I can't, then who?

          (MORE)

          

          

          

          

          90.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          The next guy? No. There is no "I can't."
          Just "I must."
          Mary - watching a grown superman unravel.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          But I don't ask, "why me?" I don't
          question it. This is me. I'm it. I do
          what I have to do. I get in there.., all
          the killing... the blood... and I deal
          with it. I clean up. I make things right.

          (BEAT)
          And. But when.., where does it end?
          (re: his cape)
          Can't stop the hemorrhage... it's
          everywhere. And it stays. All that I can
          do, Mary. The things I am capable of
          doing, I can't blink away the hell I've
          seen. It's in me...
          (points to his head)
          in here and I can't not think about
          it. It's in me. It's me.

          MARY
          Hancock... what...

          HANCOCK
          I just want to let go, Mary. Or I'll
          break. I need to get away. Get away to
          where? I don't know.
          (at Mary)
          I need your help.

          MARY
          Me? What can I do?
          (she's helpless)
          What do you want me to do?

          HANCOCK
          I want you to save me.

          MARY
          How?
          Hancock leans forward. Towards Mary. And kisses her.
          Their lips lock, twisted and entwined... until Mary, composing
          her senses, pulls away.

          MARY (CONT'D)
          Don ' t.

          

          

          

          

          91.

          HANCOCK

          (DESPERATE)
          Save me.

          MARY
          I can't.

          HANCOCK
          You can.
          (the hard sell)

          AND
          Mary,-I'll take you away. And Aaron.
          what... I'll quit. Get a real job. An
          apartment. I'll flip burgers. I don't
          know what I'm doing... what I'm saying
          anymore.

          MARY

          (OVERLAPPING)
          I'm married.
          A pause.

          HANCOCK
          To whom?

          MARY
          I love him.
          The death blow.

          HANCOCK
          No.
          (turns from her)
          Unacceptable.

          MARY
          I love him. I'm sorry.
          One can almost hear life's precious air seeping out of this
          superman - he'd slump over if not for the muscles of steel.
          Mary wants to console... but what can she do?

          HANCOCK
          I'm cold.
          Mary hands him the contents of the bag - the trenchcoat.

          MARY
          I'm sorry.

          

          

          

          

          92.
          She leaves.

          CUT TO:

          INT. BRADLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY

          Aaron. The school hallway. He holds a wooden hall PASS,
          indicating that class is in session.
          He swings into the BOYS ROOM.

          INT. BOYS ROOM - DAY

          A large restroom - empty. Little Aaron passes up on the urinals.
          Selects a private STALL. ZIP - urination begins.
          Splash segues into drip. DRIP. Aaron shakes off the last drop...

          PLOP.
          And that's the cue for the adjacent stalls - arms like tentacles
          surface from below, shackling Aaron in his spot. He can't see
          but, from behind, the stall door opens...
          Guess who?
          Perceval - possessed. He grabs the back of Aaron's head.
          Introduces it to the yellowed waters below.
          SPLASH - the head goes in, submerged. What Aaron sees for the
          next several seconds: yellow, the thrashing of.bubbles, the
          shine.-of white porcelain at.intimate range.
          What he hears: the GASPING of his own breath, GURGLE, and wicked
          laughter.
          The ambush ends. Perceval. Erlick. Spengler. One of them says...

          THEM

          (MOCKINGLY)
          "Don't mess with me."
          They leave - laughing.

          THEM (CONT'D)
          (in the distant)
          Little shit.
          Left there and in the stall - Aaron, slumped against the bowl.
          On the tile floor. A wet rag of piss.

          

          

          

          

          93.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          Mary hurries into the room - flustered, adrenaline coursing
          wild.
          She runs down the hallway to her bedroom, seeking solace in
          Horns. The cold, empty bed says he hasn't been home.

          MARY
          Horus...

          CUT TO:

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The school front. KIDS swarm into the streets, freshly released
          from captivity. And there amidst bedlam - Aaron, roughed-up and
          soiled in disgrace.
          He moves to the curb, waiting for someone to take him away. No
          Hancock, anywhere.
          Aaron waits, hopeful.

          EXT. STREET - DAY

          Hancock walks an aimless walk - in oblivion, a WHISKEY BOTTLE in
          his hand. He's been drinking. L"i
          in his path and up ahead, a little girl SUE (8) beckons at the
          upper branches of a tree.

          SUE
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Hymie. Come down, Hymie.
          She catches Hancock, Mr..Superhero who can fly, stumbling by.

          SUE (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Mister? My Hymie won't come down from the
          tree.
          Hancock's reaction - "what?"

          SUE (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          My pussycat. She won't come down.
          She stares up at him with big, blue, sad, helpless, innocent
          eyes.

          

          

          

          

          94.
          So cool, Hancock reaches down for a PEBBLE - takes it in his
          palm. Finds the little pussy named Hymie. And with a simple
          flick of the wrist... shoots it down.
          A sharp MEOW. punctuates the task. Hymie drops from the branch,
          limp and lifeless. A THUD we hear on impact.

          SUE (CONT'D)
          (so innocent, her voice)
          Holy fuck.
          Hancock resumes his course, taking off and into the wet sky.

          EXT. SKY - DAY

          Hancock's drunken flight - erratic and dangerously close to...
          BAM... buildings. He strikes the corner of a brick tower,
          plummeting downward with the dislocated debris.
          He bounces off the concrete -.in an alley.

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Mary is on the sofa - wondering where Horus might be. She checks
          h er watch.

          EXT. SCHOOLYARD - DAY

          The place is empty. Deserted.
          Aaron. On the curb. Some trash flutters by his feet. On his face
          - the abandonment of all hope. Nobody's coming, this is clear.

          EXT. ALLEY - DAY

          Hancock - on his back and amidst the rubble.
          He braces the building to get up. Drops. Gets to his feet, only
          to be confronted by the police officer from the boardwalk.
          We'll call this one officer REED - a beat cop with something
          stiff up his ass.

          REED
          What do we have here? A piece of shit.
          A slow look of recognition seizes his face - this is that
          superguy.
          Hancock stares at him.

          

          

          

          

          95.

          HANCOCK

          (HUMORLESS)
          Fuck off.
          He pushes past Reed, who acquieces willingly.

          EXT. STREET - DAY


          A
          Aaron. Walking home. Dejected. His eyes catch a glimpse of
          particular pedestrian down the street - Hancock. He gives
          chase... and confronts him, out of breath.

          AARON
          (a slight smile)
          Hi.

          HANCOCK
          (turning; drunk)
          What're you doing here?

          AARON
          (the smile fades)
          I saw you walking. Where were you today?
          You said you'd... be there.
          Hancock - looking over Aaron's abused frame.

          HANCOCK
          I don't know what you're talking about.

          AARON
          Where are you going? Can I go?

          HANCOCK
          You don't want to go where I'm going.

          AARON
          Those assholes got me in the bathroom,
          today...
          (trying to hold on)
          and you said you'd pick me up at
          school.
          Hancock turns. He's upset now.

          HANCOCK
          Listen.
          Aaron recoils.

          HANCOCK (CONY' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          Listen. I'm not here to save you.

          96.

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          No, not my job. Don't put that on me.
          (pounds his chest)
          Not my problem. Not on my shoulders. Deal
          with it, kid. You are what you are and...
          what I say, it won't do you any change.
          You'll grow up to be just like-your old
          man. A coward. Not a damn thing you can
          do about it... 'cept grab both ankles,
          hope by the grace of God the reaming's
          gentle.
          Aaron backs away from his angry wrath.

          HANCOCK (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          That's right. Walk away. Me... I'm not
          here to save you.
          He watches Aaron break 1into a run - another youngster dashed
          against the rocks.
          In Hancock's eyes - a .glint of regret. But only a glint.

          INT. BAR - DAY

          This empty bar.
          With the exception of Horus and the bartender - while he's
          drying some mugs, let's call him JOEY (30).

          HORUS

          (BOOZED)
          One.more.
          Joey studies him. He takes a mug and begins to fill it...

          HORUS (CONT'D)
          No... nevermind.
          (going to blow)
          Where's your bathroom?

          JOEY
          (not in my place)
          Bathroom's closed.
          Horus politely stands'- teeters a bit.

          HORUS
          How much.

           JOEY

          (SARCASM)
          Let's see... that's one beer. Tell you
          what. I'll take care of this one.

          

          

          

          

          97.

          HORUS
          Thank you.

          JOEY
          The register ain't open yet, anyhow.
          Horus doesn't hear him. He's already on the move, making a dash
          for the door. But too late - he VOMITS at the front entrance.

          JOEY (CONT'D)
          Shit.

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          In the armpit of town - Hancock. He lights a cigarette with the
          matchbook Gina had given him earlier.
          At attention before him - Gina, gnawing on gum, heaving in all
          her glory.

          GINA
          I've been waiting.
          They stare for one horny beat.
          Hancock moves into her. Buries his head into her bosoms, looking
          for solace. She takes him in, very maternal this Gina.

          \./

          INT. APARTMENT - DAY

          The front door opens, but slowly. Aaron steps inside.
          From the kitchen, Mary spots him in his violated condition. He
          sees her reaction, that of shock - and like that, he runs
          s obbing into her arms.

          CUT TO:

          EXT. HADES - DAY

          A phone booth - Gina's office.
          There in the back alley and in this glass booth - Hancock and
          Gina, their organs ensnared. They're pumping away. Up. Down.
          A surreal sight, indeed - the red of his cape and the black of
          her leather.

          GINA
          Come on, baby. Relax.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          

          

          

          

          98.

          GINA
          You can.
          The phone begins to RING - but they're busy.

          HANCOCK
          I can't.

          GINA
          Let it go, baby. Just let it...

          RING...

          HANCOCK
          (in tears)
          I can't.
          His arm rips through the glass...

          GINA
          . go.

          (ORGASMS)
          Oh god.

          HANCOCK
          I can't!

          RING...
          He DRILLS a hole into the phone - killing it.'

          GINA
          Don't give up, now.
          He lets her down. Tears out of the booth. Finds the sky.

          EXT. SHEEPSHEAD BAY - NIGHT

          There is movement in the sky above - aggressive formations and
          grooves in clouds once coy and demure. The wind HUMS its
          presence, toys with fallen leaves.

          'INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          It's dinner - but all is not well. Mary and Aaron and an empty
          chair. '
          They sit without talking.. They eat without making a sound.
          Between them - a ketchup bottle.
          The door bursts wide, coughing up Horus. He locates his chair
          and plops on it... misses... kisses the carpet.

          

          

          

          

          99.

          HORUS
          (on the ground; prone)
          Son. Go to your room.
          Struggles to his knees.

          MARY
          What happened toyou?

          AARON
          Dad, are you wasted?

          MARY
          Where... Aaron, he's not wasted. Go to
          your room.

          AARON
          He is wasted.
          Horus rises, under great difficulty. Feels his way to the sofa.
          When Mary tries to assist, he waves her away.

          HORUS
          Aaron. Go to your room.

          AARON
          But dad...

          MARY

          (AUTHORITY)
          Go!
          Aaron obliges, at reluctant pace.

          MARY (CONT' D)
          What do you think you're doing, Horus
          Longfellow?
          Horus gauges her.

          HORUS
          Don't "Horus Longfellow" me, Mary. I'm
          not your child. I'm your husband.

          MARY
          Horus, what're you talking about?
          (re: bruises)
          Who did this to your face?
          Horus rises from his seat with mustered strength.

          

          

          

          

          100.

          HORUS

          (OBLIVIOUS)
          But you didn't know-about me...
          Mary knows where this is headed.

          HORUS (CONT' D)

          (CONTINUING)
          You didn't know I was going to do this to
          you.
          (a half-chuckle)
          I guess I should've known. We were
          married and I knew... at the reception. I
          couldn't dance. so I sat in the back and
          watched. You were with Stuart Olmsted and
          I watched you dance. In your white dress.
          And I remember zoning out... for a
          second, just watching you. God, Mary...
          the little girl next door who used to get
          into fist fights with her brothers in
          those patched-up Toughskins. We met only
          'cause the tallest tree in the
          neighborhood was in my backyard and you
          needed to climb it.

          (BEAT)
          But that night. God, you looked so
          beautiful I.had to realize it... how much
          I loved you... one more time.

          (BEAT)
          You and Stuart danced. Laughed. And I
          remember I'm watching you there, with
          him... together like that. You looked
          good with him, I thought all of a sudden.
          Like you belong... better. And as I
          stared across the floor, it was the same
          story with all the guys there, that they
          were more right for you.

          (SWALLOWS)
          More right because that night, you walked
          in with the wrong man.

          MARY
          Why do you say that?

          HORUS
          Because I let you down.

          (BEAT)
          I'm a coward. I can't do anything about
          it. Look at me, I'm breaking up in front
          of you. And God, I fear the day when I'd
          have to defend you and Aaron. What do I
          do, then? What am I if I can't do that...
          my own wife, family? Not a man.

          You're a fool, that's what you
          you think I was completely blind when I

          masculine ego and it's the pressure...
          the standard's unreasonable. The woman,
          she wants me to part oceans. That's the
          kind of bull shit's made of. I went w

          crevice - we're walking through Hell.
          We see a BOY, huddled under a table. Hancock wraps his cape
          around him. Bolts through the inferno... as glass SHATTERS...
          and gas pipes ERUPT.
          He takes the boy to safety. Unwraps the cape... only to see the

          She rises after him and into view - it's no other than the TV
          reporter, in the flesh. She bounces over to the bathroom, as the

          Outside and beyond the door, the reporter has her ear pressed
          against wood - listening.
          So there our superhero stands, bent over a bit, yanking up a

          AARON
          Don't you fucking touch her!
          Mary SCREAMS. Hancock cringes, says...

          HANCOCK

          You're getting on my nerves.

          Hancock, please.
          He reaches down and untangles Mary from her son - she concedes

          No! Mom!

          bracing the wall for silence. He moves into the store.
          From his vantage, several beams of light slice the darkness they
          indicate the positions of the thugs.
          Horus sneaks in, heads for the second floor.

          INT. SPORTING GOODS SECTION - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Thug #3 peruses this department.
          Moving across the floor on bent knee - Horus, concocting some
          desperate strategy. He moves to the GUN counter. Slips his hand
          underneath and withdraws a hidden KEY.

          LST FLOOR - NIGHT INT. FIP

          Scarpo - stuffing his bag with merchandise. He waves Thug #2
          over.

          SCARPO
          Take the show upstairs.

          INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          The gun counter. Horus loads a .45 - it's foreign to his hand.
           He rolls out in search for Thug #3, who is by the BASEBALL
          aisle. Horus cocks the .45 in pursuit. Sidles up behind him.

           THUG #2 (O. S . )
          (from behind)
          Behind you!
          Thug #3 swings around with a Louisville Slugger - it swipes the
          45 from Horus's hand. Horus "I'm screwed."
          Thug #3 promptly knocks Horus against the BAT rack. Bats roll,
          spray the floor. Thug #3 slips hard on his approach, landing
          heavy on his head.
          Thug #2 comes running, gun raised.fa rusCdives for r a goes oose bat,
          his swing greeting Thug #2 in the
          the count.
          Horus stands over the two bodies - as surprised as we are.

          INT. FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

          Scarpo - in full alert. He's heard the commotion upstairs.

          SCARPO
          Guys?
          (no answer)
          Fuck me.
          He drops his loot. Heads for the second floor, cocking his gun.

          INT. ELECTRONICS SECTION - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT,

          Thug #1, he's writhing to music under the privacy of headphones -
          unaware of Horus behind him... Thug #1 whirls around with a gun,
          catching Horus off guard.
          Horus responds with a FLASH he had acquired from the camera
          section - the burst of light momentarily blinds the thug.
          And a quick SNAP of the bat takes out Thug #1. Horus dispenses
          of the camera, his adrenaline raging. He commandeers the free
          gun, heads downstairs.
          But the TV stops him... it displays the siege at Killybegs
          Textiles.

          REPORTER
          again, we believe that this is a
          hostage situation. Officials refuse to
          comment but we believe Hancock has
          abducted a woman, the identity of whom we
          do not yet know...
          Horus - a look of horror on his face.

          HORUS
          Mary.
          He's off, slowing to a ginger descent at the stairs. Makes his
          way down to the second floor... where he is greeted by a gun
          NOZZLE, pressed against his temple.

          SCARPO
          You're starting to piss me off.
          He pushes Horus down the remaining steps.

          INT. SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

          Horus rolls to a halt. Scarpo greets him there...
          pulling him-up by the hair...

          Horus uncoils an accurate kick to Scarpo's groin.
          Scarpo - a dumbfounded look entwined in pain. He drops.
           Horus goes for the gun. A struggle ensues, Scarpo finding Horus to the side.

          Hancock seizes his ears the bull horn testing his nerves.
          He bolts upright, turns to Mary. He seeks a special kind of
          healing.
          Hancock closes in - corners her.

          MARY
          Please.
          But there's no denying this superman - he grabs her, running his

          A revolver dangles from his fingers. Horus reaches for the gun

          HANCOCK (CONT'D)
          Are you a man?!
          Horus answers...
          He storms out with a ROCKET LAUNCHER.
          He FIRES it at the unsuspecting Hancock. It's a hit and it BLOWS
          Hancock against Killybegs Textile. It lodges him inside the
          brick structure.

          HORUS
          Fuck you.
          Hancock pries himself loose - enraged beyond imaginable. He
          GROWLS - looking to retaliate. But there's no Horus.
          Hancock explores the rubble - by the building. A sudden
          EXPLOSION rips the base of a nearby wall - it jars the wall
          loose, sending it crashing down.., on Hancock.
          CRUNCH, the concrete rips right pass Hancock - stuns but does
          not subdue him. He shakes off the dirt. Finds Horus down the
          street.
          Like a rocket, Hancock heads that way. He gets there, over Horus
          - grabbing him by the collar.
          With a swift flick, he sends the family man flying.
          THUD as his body careens off the Killybegs wall. He drops to the
          asphalt below. Horus - in pain, something broken possibly.

          

          123.
          He gets up. Tries to walk. Can't.
          Hancock - on the app roach, maintaining a cruel but steady pace
          towards his wounded game.
          Horns tries to crawl. Can't. Too much pain. He peddles back
          against the curb, nowhere left to go.
          Hancock arrives, looking afully steamed. He stands over Horus -
          not unlike Scarpo much
          The situation presents itself - he reacts.
          A kick into Hancock's groin muscle - CHINK, sliikeyt a soundWofshrugs.
          bone off metal. Absolutely harmless. Horus
          else can he do?
          Hancock tears a YIELD street SIGN it backs Ready to strikeï¿½ es
          this piece of jagged metal.


          (CONT' D)

          (DEFIANT)
          No regrets.

          HANCOCK

          (COOL)
          No mercy.
          He takes aim...

          AARON (O.S.)

          NO!
          Mary SCREAMS in the background...
          Horns. Hancock. They turn to witness the de-physicalization of
          Killybegs Textile.
          they begin to crumble, weakened by the wear Bricks... beams...
          and tear of recent artillery.
          Mary braces herself as the floor beneath begins to give. It
          slips... she SCREAMS... and collapses, taking the rest of the
          building with it.
          A CRASH, followed by a cloud of billowing smoke.
          Mary is no more.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Aaron. Roheim. In disbelief.
          

          124.

          AARON

          (BLANKLY)
          Mom...
          Horus, he struggles to his feet. Pushes past Hancock, limping
          over to the building that once was.

          HORUS

          MARY!
          Hancock - not a word. He stands in comatose silence, looking
          pale.
          Horus charges the building in possessed hysterics, trying to
          excavate his wife - one brick at a time.
          Roheim meets him there, in an effort to console.

          ROHEIM (O.S.)
          (you're wasting your time)
          Come on, Horus.
          Horus - lost in the pain. He won't listen.
          Slowly and with a sense of duty, Roheim joins the excavation. He
          r olls up his sleeve and gets to work.
          Hancock drops the yield,sign. Turns to the battlefield in his
          midst... surveys the carnage...
          A loaded beat.
          Hancock ROARS - a cry of desperation. He grimaces with defeat.
          Staggers off. SCREAMS, because what else can he do. Falls to his
          knees... by a fallen police GUN.

          He picks it up...
          points it at his head...

           FIRES the remaining rounds against his temple. Bullets carom
          off skull.
          Hancock discards the gun. Breaks into TEARS. Long SOBBING wet
          tears. He CRIES. He WEEPS. Into his cupped hands. Indeed, a
          surreal sight.
          Horus. Roheim. Engaged to the task, brick by brick. Horus works
          his way down... to a lifeless ARM, protruding from its tomb.
          He stops.

          

          126.

          INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Aaron - in his pajamas, creeping down a dark hallway. He
          approaches a DOOR.

          NARRATOR (V.0.)
          sometimes when it's dark out, so dark
          it's black, I'll see HIM.
          Aaron peers through the open door. His eyes wander inside ever
          so gently.
          On the bed there - HIM... Horns.

          NARRATOR (V.0.) (CONT'D)

          (CONTINUING)
          and it starts allover again.
          And Mary. They are in some latter state of coital bliss.
          Horus THRUSTS.
          Mary GASPS...

          NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Some things... you just never forget.

          EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING

          It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop
          the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the
          exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn,
          setting up a high-end wedding.
          A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange
          centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables...

          INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY

          A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in
          this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table,
          surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY
          TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup.
          Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in.

                              MR. TURNER
                    Any word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

                              TRACY
                    No, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

                              TRACY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

                                                     INTERCUT WITH:

          EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING

          Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust-
          covered payphone in the middle of the desert is

          VICK LENNON
          He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess.
          His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent,
          his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days.

                              VICK
                    Tracy, it's Vick.
          Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967
          Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy -
          - and missing its passenger side door.
          Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell.

          

                                                                      2.

          

          

                                TRACY
                    Hey Vick!

                              VICK
                    Listen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.

                              TRACY
                        (her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!
          Vick squints at the rising sun.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

                                                            CUT TO:

          TITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIER

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY

          The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the
          stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down
          Highway 10 towards Nevada.
          At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half-
          open shirt and mint condition aviators.
          Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's,
          handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy.
          Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax
          attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his
          khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead.
          Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school
          linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the
          back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this
          is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is.

                              STU
                    Dude this is already the best
                    weekend ever!

                              VICK
                    Stu, relax, we're still on the 10.

          

                                                                      3.

          

          

                              STU
                    Oh, did I show you pictures of my
                    kids?!

                              DOUG
                    No, dude, show `em.
          Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them
          to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this
          group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together.

                              STU
                    Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is
                    already four! Can you believe it?!

                              DOUG
                        (smiling at photos)
                    How cute... Good for you, man.
          Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed.

                              VICK
                    The one on the left is gonna be a
                    hottie. The other one, not so much.
          Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering:

                              STU
                    Jesus, dude, those are my children--

                              ALAN
                        (re: sunscreen)
                    Hey, am I rubbed in?
          Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over
          Alan's face.

                              STU
                    Yeah, you're good.

                              DOUG
                    Hey so Alan, are you and Becky
                    still together?
          But before Alan can answer--

                              VICK
                    Of course they are, Doug. Jesus,
                    Alan's been dating Becky for 14
                    years. When they first met, Alan
                    had braces and soccer hair, and
                    Becky had a functioning hymen.

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                    4.

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Asking Alan if he's still with
                    Becky is like asking the sun if it
                    still rises in the east.
          The guys try not to laugh; Alan scowls.

                              DOUG
                    She still pressuring you to get
                    married?

                              ALAN
                    Enh, we've moved past the pressure
                    stage...it's more like aggravated
                    assault stage now? Like at the last
                    wedding we went to, she threw a
                    camera at my head, called me a
                    closet fag, then ran out crying.
          The guys wince, oooo.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    But we talked, and everything's
                    cool now.

                              STU
                    Maybe you could wear a helmet to
                    Doug's wedding.

                              ALAN
                    Great idea, Stu. Thanks.

                              DOUG

                        (LAUGHING)
                    So Vick, how's business going?

                              VICK
                    Oh, great. Yeah, I'm working on
                    bringing the next big dessert craze
                    to Los Angeles. It's gonna be huge.

                              DOUG
                    What is it?

                              VICK
                    Bavarian custard. We ran the
                    numbers, and it's gonna be bigger
                    than fro yo.
          Doug and Stu nod, impressed; only Alan looks skeptical.

                              ALAN
                    Isn't custard like a trillion
                    calories--?

          

                                                                  5.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Our plan is to open three stores in
                    the Valley and then franchise it.
                    Shares are selling fast, but I can
                    probably squeeze you guys in...

                              DOUG
                    Yeah, man, count me in.

                              STU
                    Me too, man! I love pudding!
          Alan just shakes his head, unbelievable.

                              ALAN
                    Is this gonna do better than the
                    hip-hop label you started, Vick? Or
                    the topless sushi bar? Or the
                    mobile tattoo parlor--?

                              VICK
                    Tattoo-To-You was an idea ahead of
                    it's time, Alan! And don't come
                    crying to me when there's a Custard
                    Cabana on every street corner in
                    America and you didn't buy in--!

                              DOUG

                        (LAUGHING)
                    All right, all right, save it for
                    the party...
          Vick and Alan quiet. Stu is still drumming the seat.

                              STU
                    Dude! I can't believe I get to
                    party all night, and then, tomorrow
                    ...I get to sleep in! It's almost
                    too much! And FYI, if anyone gets
                    really drunk and craps themself,
                    just let me know, I can have you
                    cleaned up and partying again in
                    under three minutes. No joke. I am
                    a master of stool removal...
          They rocket off into the desert, LAUGHING...

          EXT. LAS VEGAS -- MAGIC HOUR

          As the last rays of sun fade, the Cadillac crests the final
          hill to reveal LAS VEGAS in all its illuminated splendor...

          EXT. LAS VEGAS BLVD. -- SUNSET

          The Caddy rolls down the famed Strip. We are again reminded
          of the absurd scale of Las Vegas. The 5,000 room hotels, the
          eight lane roads, the 60 foot billboards...

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          The Caddy rolls up to the Mandalay Bay. The guys hop out,
          exhilarated. Vick throws the key to the VALET...

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          The guys enter the glittering casino four men-wide, all
          smiling, all exuding vibe. Passing WOMEN sneak glances. Vick
          slides a drink off a nearby waitress's tray as they make for

          THE FRONT DESK
          A perfectly pressed LEBANESE MAN waits behind the front desk.
          Vick strides up, smiling, sunglasses still on.

                              FRONT DESK MAN
                    Welcome to the Mandalay Bay.

                              VICK
                    Checking in. Lennon comma Victor.
          The man types into his computer.

                              FRONT DESK MAN
                    Yes, we have you down for a one
                    night stay in an economy suite--
          Vick glances at the man's nametag; it reads "ATASHIR."

                              VICK
                    Hold it right there, Atashir. This
                    is my best friend from childhood,
                    Douglas Billings. In two days, he
                    is to marry a woman of great beauty
                    and strong teeth, do you
                    understand? A woman of gigantic
                    bosoms who will give him many, many
                    sons...
          Atashir looks confused. Alan looks embarrassed.

          

                                                                   7.

          

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    My two other childhood friends have
                    travelled great distances, across
                    many deserts, to be here. This
                    isn't a night in a hotel for us,
                    Atashir: this is a family reunion.
                    Perhaps you too have family
                    situated great distances away, in a
                    foreign country with much sand?
          Atashir looks like, sort of...? Vick reaches over the counter
          and touches his arm, simpatico.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Then I have but one question for
                    you, friend: if they came to town,
                    would you put them in an economy
                    suite?

                               ATASHIR
                    No, sir.

                              VICK
                    Well, then. I think one of us needs
                    to get back on his little computer
                    and find us a suitable room.
          Atashir frowns...but types away at his computer.

                              ATASHIR
                    All the deluxe rooms are taken. The
                    Dean Martin suite is available, but
                    I'd have to ask my--

                              VICK
                    Dean-o will be fine. Send up a case
                    of Cristal, two bottles of Patron,
                    four ahi sandwiches, and a crate of
                    skinless mangos...
          Vick turns to the guys:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    You guys want anything?
          The guys stammer, too stunned to speak.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    And have Jean-Marie cook up a dozen
                    of those duck skewers I like so
                    well. He knows the ones.

                              ATASHIR
                    And how would you like to pay?

          

                                                                    8.

          

          

                              VICK
                    American Express.
          Atashir looks up to accept the card. After a beat, Vick turns
          to Alan:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Dude, give him your AmEx.

                              ALAN
                    What?

                              VICK
                    Don't worry, we'll hit you later.
          Alan stammers.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Dude, come on, I paid for gas. Stop
                    being such a Jew.
          Alan stammers some more -- then angrily pulls out his card.

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

          The guys enter the room, jostling; Stu has Doug in a
          headlock. Then they freeze: the Dean Martin Suite is massive,
          complete with lounge area, two flat screen TVs, full bar and
          multiple bedrooms. The guys just gape.

                              STU
                    This is bigger than my house.
          Vick blows past them, totally unfazed.

                               VICK
                    Get dressed, ladies. We're wheels
                    up in ten.
          Stu and Doug race off to find their bedrooms, leaving Alan
          standing alone, just staring at the decadent suite.

                              ALAN
                    I am so not getting paid back.

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT

          Vick enters the bedroom, drops his bag, and starts changing
          his shirt -- when his cell phone RINGS. He answers.

                              VICK
                    This is Vick.

          

                                                                    9.

          

          
          Vick listens -- then grows a bit panicked:

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    He's in Vegas?! You're kidding me!

                        (WINCING)
                    All right, I'll get it. All right.
                    All right--!
          When Stu walks past, Vick turns away and covers the phone,
          trying to keep the call confidential:

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    I said all right, dude! How many
                    more times you want me to say all
                    right?!

                        (BEAT)
                    All right. All right.
          Vick hangs up, looking uncharacteristically stressed...

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- BATHROOM -- SAME

          Doug brushes his teeth while, at the next sink over, Alan
          selects a facial wash from his highly organized toiletries
          kit and begins washing his face.

                              ALAN
                    So, you ready for Sunday?

                              DOUG
                    Yeah. I thought I'd be nervous, but
                    I'm actually just really psyched.
          Alan nods, impressed.

                              ALAN
                    Tracy's dad still hate you?

                               DOUG
                    Oh yeah.

                              ALAN
                    Any closer to figuring out why?

                              DOUG
                    Enh, I think he wanted more for his
                    girl. I mean, I'm a teacher who
                    makes 45 grand a year, and he's a
                    titan of industry who makes 45
                    grand a day, you know? I sort of
                    get it...
                        (beat, brushing teeth)
                    Also, I'm banging his daughter. I'm
                    not sure you ever get past that.

          

                                                                  10.

          

          
          Alan smiles, yeah, there's that. Doug spits out his paste.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    You got floss?
          Alan gestures towards his toiletries kit. Doug picks it up,
          starts looking for the floss. Then Alan remembers something --
          but it's too late. Doug has found the RING BOX inside Alan's
          kit, and opened it to reveal a HUGE DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    Holy Christ!
          Alan quickly reaches for the ring--

                              ALAN
                    Ahhh yeah, I wasn't going to tell
                    anyone about that--
          Just then, Stu wanders in, wearing only his COLORADO STATE
          BOXER SHORTS. His gut is sizable.

                              STU
                    Anyone got any nipple lube--?
                        (seeing ring)
                    Jesus would you look at the size of
                    that thing?!
          Stu grabs the ring from Doug.

                              DOUG
                    It's Alan's. For Becky.

                              STU
                    Jesus, who made this thing? Diddy?

                              ALAN
                        (clutching for ring)
                    Actually, I-I was trying to keep it
                    a secret, so--
          Just then Vick blows in, singing, effeminate:

                              VICK
                    Boy Party in the bathrooooom--!
                        (sees ring, snags it)
                    Miner's cut, 2.6 Carats, slight
                    pink tint, street value: 26, 27K.
          Vick studies it in the light. Alan just rubs his temples.

                              STU
                    Dude, it's for Becky! Alan's
                    finally going to propose!

          

                                                                  11.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Well gosh-golly, Alan Mervish, good
                    for you! Where'd you get the ring?

                              ALAN
                    Oh, it's a family heirloom. My
                    grandmother smuggled it through the
                    Holocaust, actually. I was going to
                    propose to Beck this weekend.
          Doug throws his arm around Alan, happy for him.

                               DOUG
                    Well: now we have two things to
                    celebrate!

          TITLE CARD: "FRIDAY, 6:10 PM"

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY ROOFTOP -- NIGHT

          The guys, dressed to the nines, open the steel rooftop door
          and file out onto the flat tar roof of the Mandalay Bay; Vick
          is carrying a bottle of Patron and four hotel glasses.
          Bringing up the rear, Alan slides a wood block between the
          door and the frame so they aren't locked up here.
          The guys step out onto the dark, windy roof and take in the
          stunning panorama...the Strip...the mountains...the countless
          stars... It's breathtaking.

                              STU
                    Thish is so great! I love you guys!

                              VICK
                    Check it out, Stu's already wasted.
          Vick starts refilling everyone's glasses.

                              ALAN
                    We've only had two shots, man!

                              DOUG
                    Yeah, what happened, Stuey?! You
                    used to be able to drink us all
                    under the table!

                              STU
                    Dude, I'm a dad! I don't have time
                    to get plastered anymore! It blows!

                        (QUICKLY)
                    Am I a bad dad for saying that?

          

                                                                     12.

          

          

                                DOUG
                    What? No!

                              STU
                    Because my dad was a bad dad.

                              DOUG
                        (patting his shoulder)
                    That's true, Stuey, but you're
                    different. We've talked about this.
          Stu just stares at the guys, glassy-eyed. Beat.

                              STU
                    Have I showed you guys pictures of
                    my kids yet--?

                                ALAN & DOUG & VICK

                    YES!
          Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt:

                              DOUG
                    Little toast: to Tracy, the
                    coolest, kindest, most beautiful
                    woman I've ever met. I can't
                    believe she let me come this
                    weekend -- much less agreed to
                    spend the rest of her life with me.
                    I think both will prove to be
                    massive errors of judgement on her
                    part.
          The guys chuckle, hear-hear.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    And to being here, with my best
                    friends in the world. There's
                    nowhere else I'd rather be.
          The guys raise their glasses, touched.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    That said, let's not get too stupid
                    tonight, okay? I'm getting married
                    in 36 hours.

                              ALAN & STU & VICK
                    No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
                    dude.
          Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced.

          

                                                                    13.

          

          

                              DOUG
                    I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above
                    the neck -- no piercings, no weird
                    haircuts, no facial tattoos. I
                    gotta look decent on Sunday.

                              VICK
                    Jesus, what do you take us for?

                              DOUG
                    Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows
                    off the night before graduation!

                              STU
                    Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And
                    remember when I blacked out at
                    Homecoming and you wrote on my face
                    with permanent marker?! That was
                    awesome! What'd you write again?

                              ALAN & DOUG & VICK
                    "Respect me!"
          They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic.

                              STU
                    Ahh, good times, man. Good times...

                              VICK
                    We'll be good tonight, Doug.

                              ALAN
                    Seriously, man, we're your friends.

                              STU
                    Yeah, we've totally grown up since
                    then.
          Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass.

                              DOUG
                    Well then...to a night we'll never
                    forget.
          They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          THE NEXT MORNING
          Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into

          

                                                                   14.

          

          

          THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE
          THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the
          totalled suite.
          Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is
          covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans,
          platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon
          Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc.
          SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe,
          the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu.

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM"
          The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it
          reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path.
          Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu.
          The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all
          over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the
          couch, onto a pile of newspapers.

                              PILE OF NEWSPAPERS
                    OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus!
          Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find
          Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick
          pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.

                              VICK
                    Damn, dude, why are you retarded?
          Both men are ragingly hungover.
          A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:

                                 VICK (CONT'D)
                    Um, Stuey?

                                 STU
                    Yo.

                              VICK
                    Why do you have a mullet?
          Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too
          hungover to understand.

                                 STU
                    What?

          

                                                                     15.

          

          

                              VICK
                    You know, business on top, party
                    down the back?
          Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Your hair, dude. You have a mullet.
          Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom.
          After a beat, we hear his voice:

                              STU (O.S.)
                    Dude...I have a mullet.
          Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy:

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                    Just give me ten more minutes,
                    Beck...

                              STU (O.S.)
                    Whoa, did you sleep in the tub?
          Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Check it out: Alan slept in the
                    tub.

                              VICK
                    Get him up. I'm hungry.
          Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER
          turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken:

                              ALAN (O.S.)
                    Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?!
          There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat.
          Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan
          stumble out of the bathroom.
          Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night
          before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut
          off at his chest -- he's naked from there down.

                              VICK
                    Jesus, dude, put away your sack.
          Alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.

          

                                                                    16.

          

          

                              STU
                    Yeah, and it might be time for some
                    manscaping, bro. Your bush looks
                    like Yanni.
          Alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.

                              ALAN
                    What did we do last night?

                                                              CUT TO:

          INT. HALLWAY -- MOMENTS LATER

          The guys, now dressed, stagger out of their suite moments
          later. Stu walks incredibly bow-legged, like an aging cowboy.

                              STU
                    Dude, why is my ass killing me...?

          INT. ELEVATOR -- MOMENTS LATER

          Looking like crap, the guys silently descend in the elevator.
          BING! The elevator opens to expose a NICE-LOOKING COUPLE
          waiting to get on. They see the guys and immediately step
          away from the elevator.

                              MAN
                    We'll...we'll get the next one.
          The doors close. The guys continue to descend. Beat.

                              VICK
                    We might not smell very good.
          The guys shake their heads, yeah, no.

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- BREAKFAST BUFFET -- DAY

          The guys slouch in a booth, shoveling masses of buffet food
          into their mouths, washing it down with huge mugs of coffee.

                              STU
                    This might be the worst hangover
                    anyone has ever had, ever.

                              ALAN
                    I can't taste anything.

          

                                                                  17.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Please stop talking. If I don't
                    focus on eating I'm going to throw
                    up all over myself.
          The guys nod, right. They keep eating. After a long while:

                              ALAN
                    Hey... Are we missing something?
          The guys all slowly look around. Then Stu points at Alan:

                              STU
                    Yes: I left my hat in the room --
                    thank you, Alan.
          They continue eating. Alan looks up again, still troubled.

                              ALAN
                    No. That's not it... There's
                    something else...
          Vick nods at Stu as he stuffs food in his mouth.

                              VICK
                    You gonna finish that cruller?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Vick takes it, packs it into his
          already stuffed mouth. Then Alan realizes:

                              ALAN
                    Doug. Guys, where's Doug?
          The guys look around. Hunh.

                              STU
                    Yeah. He's not here.

                              VICK
                    Probably left him in the room.
          Vick pulls out his cell phone, starts dialing.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    I'll call his cell.
          Then a phone RINGS in Stu's pocket. He answers:

                              STU
                    Good morning, this is Stu?

                              VICK
                    It's me, meatdick.

          

                                                                     18.

          

          

                              STU
                        (to Alan, concerned)
                    It's Vick--
          Then Stu realizes. Oh.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    This is Doug's phone.
          Vick nods, ya. He's already dialing another number.

                              ALAN
                    You calling the room?
          Vick nods, uh-huh. He lets it ring, rubbing his temples. Then
          he hangs up.

                                 VICK
                    No answer.
          Vick goes back to eating. Alan frowns.

                              ALAN
                    Ummm...shouldn't we look for him?
                    Check-out is in like ten minutes.

                              STU
                    Yeah, and we told Tracy we'd have
                    Doug back to LA by five.
          Vick just looks at both of them, his mouth full of food:

                              VICK
                    I'm eabing.

                              ALAN
                    What an asshole. Stu, check the
                    pool and the casino, I'll check the
                    room and the gym. Maybe he's
                    working out or something...
          Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    And Vick, if you could keep a close
                    eye on the buffet, that'd be really
                    helpful. Thanks, man.
          Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full:

                              VICK

                    HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING!

          

                                                                  19.

          

          
          Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller.

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake.

                              ALAN
                    Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man.
          Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes
          him a second to realize what's wrong:

          THE BED IS MISSING
          There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay.
          Alan scratches his head.

                              ALAN
                    That's weird...

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY

          Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright
          sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool.
          Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted!

                              STU
                    No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's
                    totally cool...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. GYM -- DAY

          Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is
          packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself:

                              ALAN
                    I hate you all...

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS

          Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud:

                              STU

                    DOUG! DOUG!
          Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands.

          

                                                                  20.

          

          

                               GAY MAN
                    Hey Stu.

                              STU
                    Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--!
          Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns
          around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone.
          Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan
          talking to Atashir at

          THE RECEPTION DESK
          He slowly bow-legs himself over.

                              STU
                    You find Doug?

                              ALAN
                    No, I assume you didn't either?
          Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone.

                              ATASHIR
                    There is no Doug Billings at any of
                    the area hospitals, morgues, or
                    police stations.
          The guys frown, starting to grow worried.

                              STU
                    Maybe he went for a jog?

                              ALAN
                    Dude. It's 120 degrees outside.

                              STU
                    Or shopping?
          The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.

                              ALAN
                    Great. So we've officially lost
                    Doug. His wedding is in what, 22
                    hours?

                              VICK
                    Relax, it's Doug, he's probably
                    crashed out on someone's couch
                    right now. All we have to do is
                    retrace our steps from last night,
                    and we'll find him.

          

                                                                  21.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Okay, so last night...
          The guys wince, trying to remember. It's painful to think.

                              VICK
                    Well, we started on the roof...

                              ALAN
                    Right, that was like, 6ish...?

                              VICK
                    Then...I think...we had steaks at
                    the Palm?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah. Then...we played craps at the
                    Hard Rock...maybe?

                              VICK
                    That sounds right...
          Stu throws up his arms, already giving up.

                              STU
                    Okay, honestly? I don't even
                    remember going to dinner.

                              VICK
                    I vaguely recall...doing body shots
                    ....at some point? Is that...maybe?

                               ALAN
                    I'm pretty much blank after The
                    Hard Rock.

                              VICK
                    I think we went to the Flamingo
                    after that...? And then, I just
                    remember a lot of blue light...and
                    the overpowering smell of baby oil.

                              ALAN
                    So that was what, 10ish?

                              VICK
                    Give or take.

                              STU
                    Was Doug still with us?
          Vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.

          

                                                                  22.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Yes. Yes. Doug was with us. I
                    tackled him...for some reason.
          The guys nod, okay, okay.

                              ALAN
                    Okay. So we only have a 13 hour
                    window where we could've lost him.
          They guys frown. Shit. Stu puts his hands into his pockets,
          thinking... Then he feels something. A matchbook.
          He pulls it out. It's from The Flamingo Nightclub.

                              STU
                    Hey! Look, we were at the Flamingo.
          A long beat of silence...
          Then the guys hurry to an empty BLACKJACK TABLE and start
          emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before.
          They find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...

                              ALAN
                    ATM receipt from the Rio at 10:37--
                        (reading it)
                    For 600 dollars?!

                              VICK
                    The valet ticket says we returned
                    here at 4:57AM.

                              STU
                    We drove last night?
          The guys wince, jesus...

                              ALAN
                    Here's a receipt from Sbarro. The
                    meal was comped for some reason--

                              VICK
                    Why do we have a matchbook from The
                    Golden Pony All Male Revue?
          The guys exchange a look, alarmed.

                              ALAN
                    Someone could've given that to us.

          

                                                                    23.

          

          

                              STU
                        (laughing, nervous)
                    Yeah, totally! There's no way we
                    went there! We're not gay! Hahaha!
          They frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the
          blackjack table.

                              ALAN
                    I think we should call Tracy.

                              VICK
                    Absolutely not.

                              ALAN
                    What if Doug called her? She might
                    know where he is.
          Stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.

                              STU
                    Yeah, I'm with Alan on this one.

                              VICK
                    Of course you're with Alan, you're
                    both gutless cowards. But we're not
                    calling Tracy. You never call the
                    bride from the bachelor party.
                    Ever. If my balls were on fire and
                    Tracy was sitting next door with a
                    tall glass of water, I still
                    wouldn't call her. It's a rule.

                              ALAN
                    But shouldn't we at least tell her
                    we're gonna be getting home late?

                              VICK
                    She has a watch, she'll figure it
                    out.

                              ALAN
                    I think I'm beginning to see why
                    you're always single.

                              VICK
                    And I think I'm beginning to see
                    why you're always a douche--

                              STU
                        (clutching his ass)
                    Guys, wait. I need your help -- oh
                    my God -- like right now. Come on.

          

                                                                    24.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, what is it?

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER

          Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed
          men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans.

                              VICK
                    I can't believe we're doing this.

                              STU
                    You don't have to look up my butt,
                    just at it. Something is terribly,
                    terribly wrong...
          Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes.

          
          He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I
          ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter.

                              ALAN
                    Sweet mother of mercy...

                              VICK
                    Who's Roger?

                              STU
                    I-I-I don't know?! What do you
                    think it means?!

                              VICK
                    What do I think it means? Well,
                    Stuart, your ass is all torn up and
                    you're wearing thong underwear
                    declaring your love for another
                    dude -- I don't think we need the
                    CSI team for this one! You got
                    reamed last night, man!
          Stu covers his mouth, horrified!

                              ALAN
                    I'm sure there's a perfectly
                    logical explanation for this...

                              STU
                    Really?! What?!
          Alan tries to think of one.

          

                                                           25.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, maybe there isn't.

                              VICK
                    Look, I'm sure Roger is a very
                    nice, considerate young man--

                              STU
                    Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?!

                              VICK
                    Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near
                    cool enough.

                              STU
                        (gasping, realizing)
                    I do watch Dancing With The Stars
                    with the kids!

                              ALAN
                    Oh god, that doesn't mean you're
                    gay.

                              VICK
                    But sort of...it does?
          Stu grows increasingly frantic.

                              STU
                    And once, I caught myself gazing at
                    a topless photo of David Beckham!

                              ALAN
                    So what, he's a great-looking dude--

                              STU
                    And then I had those weird feelings
                    for Vick that time in middle
                    school, remember?!
          Everyone stops. Vick most of all.

                                VICK
                    Um, what?

                              STU
                    Yeah, that weekend we were all
                    camping -- I told you this.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, no you didn't.

                                STU
                    I didn't?

          

                                                                    26.

          

          

                              VICK
                    I think I'd remember, dude.

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, I think we'd all remember.

                               STU
                    Yeah. I had weird feelings for you
                    that weekend. Like really hot,
                    really gay feelings. But then they
                    went away.
          Vick is just looking at him, stunned.

                              ALAN
                    Wait -- I was there that weekend.
                    Did you have gay feelings for me?

                              VICK
                    Unbelievable.

                              ALAN
                    What?! I was a good-looking kid!

                              VICK
                    Please, you're so not his type!

                              STU
                    Wait, what?
          Just then, a FATHER and his YOUNG SON enter the men's room
          and see Stu standing there, pants down, in his G string...

                              VICK
                    Look, Stu, one homosexual
                    experience doesn't mean you're
                    permanently gay, okay? A lot of
                    guys test the waters.
          ...the FATHER and SON wheel right back around and exit.

                              ALAN
                    All right, we're scaring the
                    children. Let's go.
          The guys head for the door. Stu quickly pulls up his pants.

                              STU
                    Wait -- so have either of you
                    tested the waters?

                              VICK
                    No! We're not gay!

          

                                                                  27.

          

          
          Stu looks highly confused as he follows them out onto

          THE CASINO FLOOR
          The guys power through the crowded casino, towards the exit.
          Stu tries to keep up, genuinely concerned.

                              STU
                    How am I going to tell my wife?

                              VICK
                    Quickly, and from a great distance.
          Alan's hand accidentally hits a brass railing and CLINKS...

                              STU
                    Jesus, what kind of father am I?
          Alan's hand CLINKS against the railing again, and this time
          it registers. Alan looks down -- and stops cold.

                                 ALAN
                    Oh my God.

                              STU
                        (really scared)
                    You think Erin will try to take the
                    kids--?

                              ALAN
                    Oh...my...God.

                              VICK
                        (turning, annoyed)
                    What now?
          Alan holds up the source of his CLINKING: on his ring finger
          is a huge, tacky, silver WEDDING RING with a unicorn on it.

                              STU
                        (not getting it)
                    Cool ring. Also, my Dad is gonna
                    have a field day with this.
          Vick, however, recognizes the implications of the ring, and
          starts back towards Alan.

                              VICK
                    Oh my God... Oh my God...

                              STU
                    What's the big--?
                        (finally realizing)
                    Oh! OH! OH!

          

                                                                   28.

          

          
          Alan steadies himself against a SLOT MACHINE, and shakily
          takes off the massive unicorn ring.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Maybe it's not a wedding ring?

                              ALAN
                        (reading inscription)
                    "To My Noble Husband, Alan."
          The guys eyes bulge, oh shit!

                              STU
                    This is worse than my underwear!
          Vick takes the ring and reads the rest of the inscription:

                              VICK
                    "Now & Forever Wedding Chapel."
          They guys exchange a look.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Well, at least it's a lead.
          Beat. Then Alan turns and THROWS UP all over the slot
          machine. Nearby OCTOGENARIAN SLOT PLAYERS look over,
          disgusted -- but continue playing their nickels.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- VALET STAND -- DAY

          The three guys exit the hotel looking like crap. Vick hands
          his ticket to the valet. Alan chews mint gum.

                              VICK
                    So, we go to the wedding chapel, we
                    find out what we did with Doug, we
                    recover him, and we're back in LA
                    before sundown. Easy as Stu's ass.
          No one laughs. Tense SILENCE as they wait for the car.

                              STU
                    Check it out, some idiot threw his
                    bed out the window last night.
          Stu points over at a huge stone GRIFFIN in front of the hotel
          with an ENTIRE BED impaled upon its ear.

                              ALAN
                    That was us, dude.

          

                                                                    29.

          

          

                              STU
                    Really?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, there's no bed in Doug's
                    room.

                               STU

                        (FROWNING)
                    Oh. Well, I'm sure we had a good
                    reason for doing it.

                        (BEAT)
                    You think they'll charge us for--?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, Stu, I really do.

                              VICK
                    Guys, relax. Everything's gonna be
                    cool...
          Just then the Valet drives up in

          VICK'S DESTROYED CADILLAC
          The exterior is scratched and filthy, like it's been off-
          roading. The hubcaps are gone, as is the front passenger side
          door. A wisp of STEAM trails up from under the hood.
          The guys just stand there, agape.

                              STU
                    You okay, Vick?

                               VICK
                    I'm not emotionally prepared to
                    talk about it just yet, Stuart, but
                    thank you.
          Vick dons his sunglasses and heads for his destroyed car...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          THE GUYS ROLLING DOWN THE STRIP
          in their ridiculous car. Cars full of FAMILIES, cute GIRLS,
          even NUNS, point and stare. Our guys just face forward, each
          quietly suffering in their own personal Hell.

                              ALAN
                    Seriously: what am I gonna tell
                    Becky? For 14 years she's been
                    begging me to get married...

          

                                                                    30.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Well, now you did. Just not to her.
          Alan glowers at the city going by... Then he sits up--

                              ALAN
                    Wait, is that homeless guy wearing
                    Doug's shirt?
          The guys turn to see a HOMELESS GUY weaving down the sidewalk
          in Doug's DISTINCTIVE ORANGE SHIRT from the night before.
          Once they pass, the guys exchange a look.

                                 STU
                    Naaah.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that was a different shirt.
          Alan doesn't look so sure. They drive in silence. Then:

                                 VICK (CONT'D)
                    Left turn.
          Stu, sitting shotgun, braces against the empty doorframe so
          as not to fall out of the car as they turn left...

          EXT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

          Sitting in an East Vegas strip mall, sandwiched between a
          laundromat and a pawn shop, is the pink Now & Forever Wedding
          Chapel. The Cadillac parks in the lot out front.

          INT. NOW & FOREVER WEDDING CHAPEL -- DAY

          Everything in the small, tacky wedding chapel is white
          plastic. White plastic plants, white plastic cross, white
          plastic chairs. The guys enter.

                              ALAN
                    What if they don't remember us--?

                                 VOICE BEHIND THEM

                    AAAAYYYYY!
          The guys turn to find the hirsute owner of the chapel, STEVE
          GIANOPOLUS, 40's, in a tight white suit, his arms spread
          wide. Steve is all Vegas, by way of Long Island.

                              STEVE
                    How are you, you dumb bastards?!

          

                                                                  31.

          

          
          He warmly hugs the guys. They have zero memory of him, and it
          shows as they hug back weakly, unfamiliar...

                              STEVE (CONT'D)

                    CARLA, GET YOUR FAT ASS OUT HERE!

                    ALAN AND THE BOYS ARE HERE!
                        (to the guys)
                    You here to pick up your wedding
                    photos?!
          Alan starts to decline, when--

                              VICK
                    Does the pope wear a funny hat?!
                    Let's do this thing!
          Steve CACKLES and guides them over to a table; Alan scowls.

                              STEVE
                    And where is Chastity today?
          They all sit on white plastic chairs.

                              ALAN
                    W-Who's...Chastity?

                              STEVE

                        (LAUGHING)
                    Your wife, man--! AWW, you're just
                    breaking my balls!
          Alan looks ill. Laughing, Steve retrieves a folder and starts
          laying out a series of WEDDING PHOTOS on the table. Vick
          eagerly peruses them, enjoying this.

                               VICK
                    Uh, it was such a lovely ceremony,
                    wasn't it?

                              STEVE
                    Hand to God, I've never seen two
                    people more in love!

                              VICK
                    Sadly, I believe you...
          The guys look at the photos of Alan's wedding from the night
          before. They're typical wedding shots, only the guys are all
          wearing MEDIEVAL COSTUMES, swords, bows, tights, even armor.
          They look incredibly happy -- and incredibly drunk.
          The next photo is of Alan and his BUSTY BLONDE BRIDE. She's
          having a blast in a white medieval gown and tiara.

          

                                                                  32.

          

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Hello, Chastity...
          Alan just closes his eyes, oh God.

                              ALAN
                    I am never...ever...drinking again.

                              STU
                    Jesus, she is stacked.

                              VICK
                    Stu, please, show some class.
                    That's Alan's wife you're talking
                    about.

                              STU
                        (to Alan, guilty)
                    Sorry. She looks really nice.
          But Alan is too busy gaping at the next photo, of him and
          Chastity atop a UNICORN in the chapel. (It is, of course, a
          rented pony with a lame horn strapped to its head.)

                              ALAN
                    We got a unicorn?!

                              STEVE
                    Oh, yeah, you got the entire Double
                    Camelot Package.
          Alan just rubs his temples, oh no.

                              ALAN
                    A-And how much did that cost?

                              STEVE
                    7 thousand dollars.
          Alan closes his eyes. Stu and Vick exchange a look, no way!

                              STEVE (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, you didn't want to get it,
                    either, but Vick insisted.
          Beat. Then Alan pounces across the table at Vick!

                              ALAN
                    I'm gonna kill you!

                              VICK
                        (fending him off)
                    You can't put a pricetag on love,
                    Alan! OW! You just can't!

          

                                                                    33.

          

          
          Stu hops up and starts pulling Alan off of Vick.

                              VOICE BEHIND THEM

                    STOP FIGHTING IMMEDIATELY!
          The guys straighten like schoolboys as Steve's wife CARLA,
          40's, enters. She's wearing a toga, smoking a menthol, and
          dollying in several large CARDBOARD BOXES. Then she grins:

                              CARLA
                    Ahhh! I'm just busting your nuts!
          She lowers the dolly and hurries over for hugs.

                              CARLA (CONT'D)
                    Good to see you, you stupid mooks!
          Stu and Alan force smiles, no idea who this woman is. Vick,
          on the other hand, steps forward and hugs her tightly.

                              VICK
                    It's good to be seen, Carla. It's
                    good to be seen.

                              CARLA
                    I brought the rest of your package.
          Carla begins unloading things from the cardboard boxes.

                              CARLA (CONT'D)
                    First: Two dozen commuter mugs...
          She unpacks 24 COMMUTER MUGS with Alan and Chastity's photo
          emblazoned on them. Alan winces, oh god. Stu grabs one:

                              STU
                    No way! Awesome!

                              STEVE
                    A hundred DVDs of the ceremony...
          She lays out the stacks of DVDs. Vick nods at Alan:

                              VICK
                    For you and Chastity to watch on
                    your anniversary...
          Alan just clenches his jaw, I fucking hate you.

                              CARLA
                    The velvet wall hanging...
          She pulls out a six foot air-brushed velvet WALL HANGING of
          Alan and Chastity riding the unicorn together in outer space.

          

                                                                    34.

          

          

                              VICK
                    And it looks like real velvet,
                    Alan, so no machine wash, okay?

                              CARLA
                    And the big finish:
          Vick and Stu do a DRUMROLL on the table, excited...
          Then Carla pulls out a FOUR FOOT BRONZE SHIELD with a bas-
          relief of Alan and Chastity MAKING OUT on it. Alan just
          closes his eyes.

                                 STU

                    HOLY CRAP!

                              VICK

                    DUDE, YOU HAVE A SHIELD!

                              STU
                    I want a shield!

                              VICK
                    Me too! Hey, can Stu and I get a
                    shield?

                              ALAN
                    I don't suppose you have any sort
                    of return policy, do you?

                              STEVE
                    Um...if you know another couple who
                    looks exactly like you guys, and
                    who want two dozen commuter mugs, a
                    wall hanging, and a shield...sure.
          Alan scowls. Then his cellphone RINGS. He angrily answers it
          without looking at the Caller ID.

                                 ALAN
                    What.
          We hear someone YELLING AT HIM. Alan's eyes bulge.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Oh, hey Becky! Hi!
          He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla:

                              VICK
                    That's his girlfriend of 14 years.
                    I'm sure this'll only take a
                    minute...

          

                                                                  35.

          

          
          Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan
          tries to talk to his furious girlfriend.

          INTERCUT WITH:

          BECKY
          in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase.
          She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set.

                              BECKY
                    Can you tell me why all the goddamn
                    credit cards are maxed out?!

                              ALAN
                    No! I-I have no idea--!
          Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed:

                              VICK

                    HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR

                    BEST MAN, DUDE!

                              STU

                    YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER!

                    WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?!
          Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard.

                              BECKY
                    "Your best man?!" What's going on
                    there, Alan?!

                              ALAN
                    Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS

                    ARE JUST BEING DICKS!

                              VICK

                    HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET-

                    SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I

                    BOGART A FEW?!
          Alan furiously flips them off, shut up!

                              BECKY
                    I really don't appreciate being
                    mocked right now, Alan, especially
                    about wedding-related issues. You
                    know how hard this weekend is going
                    to be for me.

                              ALAN
                    I know, baby! I know--

          

                                                                  36.

          

          

                              BECKY
                    So you'll call the credit card
                    company and straighten this out?

                              ALAN
                    Yes. I will. I promise.

                              BECKY
                    Okay. Okay...
                        (beat, calming)
                    Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll
                    see you soon, okay? Love you.
          But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making
          out with his blonde bombshell wife...

                              BECKY (CONT'D)
                    Alan? Hello? I said I love you?!

                              ALAN
                    Yes, no, I love you too!
          Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable.
          STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales.

                              STU
                    Hey, how's Becky doing, man?!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, did she ask about us?!
          Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we

                                                            CUT TO:

          STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP
          through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan
          sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD.

                              STU
                    Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick
                    found a great clue.

                              VICK
                    Turns out Doug was in all the
                    wedding photos, which means -- if
                    the time stamp was right -- we had
                    him in our possession until 11 pm.

          

                                                                  37.

          

          

                              STU
                    That's another hour of last night
                    that we can account for. Isn't that
                    great?

                              ALAN
                        (bitterly sarcastic)
                    Amazing.

                              VICK
                    Hey, Steve, you don't happen to
                    know where we were heading when we
                    left here last night, do you?

                              STEVE
                    Well, the Double Camelot Package
                    comes with a five course wedding
                    feast, so I assume you went there.

                              STU
                    Great -- where was the feast?

                              STEVE
                    Sbarro, over in the Fremont mall.

                                                            CUT TO:

                              ALAN (V.O.)
                    I paid 7 grand for Sbarro?!

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- MOMENTS LATER

          The beatup Caddy is packed with wedding crap. Vick is busy
          trying to reverse the overloaded car out of the parking spot.
          Stu's in the backseat with the huge shield, while Alan
          seethes up front.

                              VICK
                    Your negativity is like a little
                    black cloud over our car, Alan.
                    You've got to let go of this.

                              ALAN
                    Let go of what, exactly, Vick?! The
                    fact that I married a complete
                    stranger last night? Or that my
                    girlfriend's about to leave me? Or
                    that I'm broke? Which one?!

                              VICK
                    You're broke? I thought you were

                    LOADED--

          

                                                                  38.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    I know you think it's like
                    terminally uncool to be in a
                    committed relationship, Vick, but I
                    actually love Becky, okay?

                        (SINCERE)
                    I-I honestly don't know what I'd do
                    without her...I really don't...
          Alan looks off, lost, sick. Vick stops the car short.

                              VICK
                    Alan. Honey. Have you considered,
                    even for a second, that maybe the
                    things we do when we're drunk are
                    what we secretly want to do?

                              ALAN
                        (dripping with sarcasm)
                    Yeah, no, you're absolutely right,
                    Vick, I've always secretly wanted
                    to marry a bottle blonde with big
                    fake melon tits named Chastity!

                              STU
                    I ain't mad atcha, dude...

                               VICK
                    Or, after 14 years, maybe you don't
                    have the balls to leave Becky, and
                    this is your way of getting her to
                    leave you.

                              ALAN
                    I was going to propose to her this
                    weekend, you jackass!

                              VICK
                    All the more reason to freak out.
          Alan opens his mouth to respond, but nothing comes out. Vick
          nods, chew on that, and continues slowly reversing the car.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    I love you, Alan Mervish, I do, but
                    you've always had a major pole up
                    your ass. Maybe last night was your
                    inner cool person trying to get out-

                              ALAN
                    I swear to God, Vick, if you say
                    one more word to me, I will destroy
                    you.

          

                                                                  39.

          

          

                              STU
                    Guys, come on, let's not use our
                    angry words--

          SMASH!
          A baseball bat SHATTERS the windshield! The guys all jump!
          Vick slams on the brakes!

                              VICK
                    What the--?!
          They look up to see two MASSIVE SAMOAN MEN in loud Hawaiian
          shirts, KALOLO FANALUA and KIKIOLANI, 30's, standing on
          either side of the car. And they look pissed.

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    Get out of the car, Vick.
          Stu and Alan recoil in terror.

                              STU
                    Who are these guys?!

                              VICK
                    Stu, please.
                        (to Kalolo Fanalua)
                    I think there's been some sort of
                    mistake, Mister...?

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    I'm Mr. Shut The Hell Up And Get
                    The Hell Outta The Car, and this is
                    my associate, Mr. Smash You In The
                    Teeth If You Say Another Word.

                              VICK
                        (beat, to Alan)
                    Those so aren't their real names.

                              ALAN
                    Vick, don't be a dick--!

                              VICK
                    Alan? Relax. These men aren't going
                    to hurt us. They're from Hawaii.

          SMASH! SMASH! SMASH!
          Kikiolani starts viciously smashing the car!

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    We're from Guam, bitch! Now get
                    outta the car!

          

                                                                    40.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat!
                    Jesus, why is everyone trying to
                    kill my car...?
          Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle.
          Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open,
          right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and
          Vick slams his door shut   and

          FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE!
          The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the
          street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out
          of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement...

          EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS

          Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge
          SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out.

                              ALAN
                    Why'd you do that?!

                              VICK

                        (INCREDULOUS)
                    Really?

                              STU
                    Maybe they just wanted to talk!

                              VICK
                    I honestly don't know how you two
                    are still alive.

                              ALAN
                    Do you think we stole something
                    from them last night?!

                              STU
                    Oh my god I am such a bad dad!

                              ALAN
                        (producing cellphone)
                    I'm calling the police. This is
                    getting way out of control--

                              VICK
                    No! No cops!

                              ALAN
                    "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty
                    Cent?!

          

                                                                  41.

          

          

                              STU
                    Yeah, Vick, what's going on?

                              VICK
                    Nothing! I just think we should
                    focus on finding Doug and not get
                    distracted by every little thing!

                              ALAN
                    Every little thing?! We were just
                    assaulted by the Yakuza!

                              VICK
                    Oh please, those guys are from
                    Guam. Get a grip.

                              ALAN
                    They knew your name, Vick! Which
                    means they probably know who Stu
                    and I are, too!

                              STU
                    If anything ever happened to my
                    family, Vick...

                              VICK
                    Fine. Let's just go back to the
                    hotel -- Doug is probably back from
                    wherever he spent the night, we'll
                    get him, we'll straighten out
                    whatever we did to those angry
                    Samoans, then we'll get the hell
                    back to LA, okay? Left turn.
          Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan
          hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car.

                                                            CUT TO:

          TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM"

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY

          The boys hurry into their room, stressed.

                              VICK
                    Doug? Doug?
          Alan quickly checks the room phone.

                              ALAN
                    No messages.

          

                                                                  42.

          

          

                              STU
                    Come on, let's toss the place.
          Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while
          Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms...

          INT. BEDROOM

          Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes,
          looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on
          the ground. Picks it up.

                              STU
                    Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested
                    30 grand in your custard store last
                    night!
          Vick calls from the other bedroom.

                              VICK (O.S.)
                    Smart move, man.
          Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes.

                              STU
                    Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?!
          Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the
          closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring
          away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face.

                              VICK
                    Whoa.

                              STU
                    You think she's what those Guamian
                    dudes wanted?

                              VICK
                    No. I think she's Alan's wife.
          Stu covers his mouth, oh shit! Vick produces the wallet-
          sized photos from Alan's wedding, compares them, and nods.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan? Wanna step in here, buddy?
          A second later Alan enters, what's up?

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan, Chastity. Chastity, Alan.
          Alan looks down, sees Chastity SNORING on the closet floor,
          her body all contorted, and freezes. Oh my God.

          

                                                                  43.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What...what am I supposed to do?

                              STU
                    Wake her up, man!

                               ALAN
                    Why me?!

                              VICK
                    Because she's your spouse, dude!
          Scowling, Alan slowly crouches down. Then, a little scared,
          he nudges her. Nothing. He nudges her harder.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Pinch her tit. It always works.
          Alan shakes her a bit harder and -- BRRAPPPP -- the girl lets
          out a massive burp and awakens, COUGHING. Alan jumps back up,
          terrified. The woman, CHASTITY, looks around, disoriented.

                              CHASTITY
                    Dang, did I sleep in the closet
                    again...?
          Then she notices the guys staring down at her. She smiles,
          recognizing them:

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Oh hey, guys! What's up?
          She shakily climbs to her feet to expose a skimpy skirt, a
          snug tube top, and mascara smeared all over her face.
          The guys have no idea what to say. She kisses Alan on the
          cheek, very intimate -- like, well, a husband and wife.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Morning, honey...
          She exits into the living room, picking her wedgie.
          Beat. Alan is speechless.

                              STU
                    She seems really cool.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, I really like her, man.

          

                                                                  44.

          

          

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- LIVING ROOM

          Chastity gathers her belongings -- jacket, purse, G string --
          from around the totalled living room. The guys file in.

                              VICK
                    So, um, did you take Alan's name?

                              STU
                    Yeah, are you Chastity Mervish
                    now--?

                              ALAN
                    Listen to me. Just...did we, or did
                    we not, have sex last night?
          Alan braces, please say no, please say no...
          Vick braces, please say yes, please say yes...

                                 CHASTITY
                    Well...ya?
          Alan slumps, his life over. Vick pumps his fist, YES!

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    But we waited til we were married.
          Alan GROANS.

                              VICK
                    What a responsible, upstanding
                    young Jew. They don't make `em like
                    that anymore, am I right?
          Chastity smiles, sweet, as she straps on her 6 inch heels.

                              CHASTITY
                    I know -- he even wanted to use a
                    rubber.
          Alan breaks into a COUGHING FIT.

                              ALAN
                    Wait-- we didn't use a condom?!

                              CHASTITY
                    It's cool, I sponge.
          Alan leans against a wall, dizzy.

                              ALAN
                    Can someone...please open a window?

          

                                                                 45.

          

          
          Stu turns and tries to open a window. No luck.

                              STU
                    They don't open.

                              CHASTITY
                    So you guys don't remember any of
                    last night?

                              VICK
                    Yeah, not so much.

                              CHASTITY
                    Hey, been there before, right?
                        (grabbing her sizable bra)
                    Sucks, though. The wedding was
                    really fun. I'm bummed you don't
                    remember it, Alan.
          She smiles, a little saddened. Stu whispers to Alan:

                              STU
                    Dude, I think your wife's mad at
                    you.

                              VICK
                    You don't happen to remember what
                    time we met you last night, do you?

                              CHASTITY
                    Sure, we met at the bar at like
                    10:00? Then we got married on my
                    smoke break, which was like 11:00?

                              VICK
                    It's the All-American love story,
                    isn't it? What happened next?

                              CHASTITY
                    Well, I had to go back to work. But
                    when I got off at 5:30, I met up
                    with you guys back here.

                              VICK
                    And was Doug with us then?

                              CHASTITY
                    No.

                              VICK
                    Interesting... Do you have any idea
                    where we went after the wedding?

          

                                                                      46.

          

          

                                CHASTITY
                      No, but I bet some of my work
                      friends do. You were partying with
                      them pretty hard.

                                STU
                      Work friends?

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

          STRIPPERS
          Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles.

          INT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY

          Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip
          Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete
          with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages
          of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS.
          Alan follows after Chastity, horrified.

                                ALAN
                      You work here?
          Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched.

                                CHASTITY
                      Yeah -- and this is the pole where
                      we first met!
          She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER
          currently spins. Alan looks ill.

                                CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                      It's always been my lucky pole...

                                ALAN
                      Look, I don't know how to tell you
                      this, but--

                                CHASTITY

                      HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT!
          She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING
          to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole.

                                PLATINUM THE STRIPPER
                      Get it, girl!

                                CHASTITY
                      Come on, let's go meet my
                      bridesmaids!

          

                                                                  47.

          

          
          She hurries off, but Alan can't move.

                              STU
                    Dude.

                              VICK
                    I know.

                              ALAN
                    The Holocaust, man.
          Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder.

                              VICK
                    Look, we can get your grandmother's
                    ring back. We just gotta go about
                    it in the right way.

                              ALAN
                    I have besmirched my people.

                              STU
                    Don't be so hard on yourself, dude--
          Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS.

                              CHASTITY
                    These were my bridesmaids,
                    Anastasia and Starr!

                              STARR
                    Hey, boys! Good to see you again!

                              ANASTASIA
                    Mazel Tov--!

                              ALAN
                    Please...don't.
          Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY
          PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system:

                              STRIP CLUB D.J.

                    OKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY

                    HORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW

                    COUPLE, CHASTITY AND ALANNNN!
          The entire club CHEERS! Chastity holds up her wedding ring
          and dances around, WOO HOO! Alan waves meekly. Thanks.

                              STRIPPER D.J.

                    IN HONOR OF THEIR MARRIAGE, WE'RE

                    DOING TWO-FOR-ONE LAPDANCES! TWO

                    SONGS FOR TWENTY BUCKS!

          

                                                                  48.

          

          
          The DJ puts on Nine Inch Nails' "I Want to Fuck You Like An
          Animal" and the club gets hopping again.

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh my God, he's playing our song!
                        (giddy, to Alan)
                    This song was playing when we met,
                    remember?! You kept sliding
                    twenties into my thong and saying
                    "I will always love you. I will
                    always love you."
          Alan closes his eyes.

                                ALAN
                    Twenties?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah, it was so sweet...

                              ALAN
                    Look, I don't know how to say this,
                    but my friends and I were very
                    drunk last night. We would never
                    come to a place like this--
          He glances over at Vick and Stu -- but they're gone.

                                ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Guys?

                                                            CUT TO:

          VICK AND STU TOASTING SHOTS OF JAGERMEISTER
          and downing them. PULL BACK to see that they are sitting in

          THE CHAMPAGNE ROOM
          getting lapdances from STARR and ANASTASIA. The Champagne
          Room is a dark, plush private suite in the back of the Crazy
          Horse where strippers ply their craft; the room is half full.
          Vick watches Starr lean over and make out with Anastasia.

                              VICK
                    You are the best bridesmaids ever.

                              STU
                        (huge boobs in his face)
                    Dude: I might not be gay.
          Then Alan hurries in with Chastity; he looks pissed.

          

                                                          49.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What the hell are you doing?!

                              VICK
                    Two-for-ones, man.

                              ALAN
                    We don't have time for this! We
                    gotta find Doug!

                              VICK
                    What do you think we're doing?

                              ALAN
                    What?

                              VICK
                    We're getting into the mindset of
                    last night, to see if it sparks any
                    memories.
                        (to his stripper)
                    Now: is this exactly how you were
                    dancing for me last night, Starr?
          She nods. Vick nods, pensive, scientific.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, still no memories. Keep going
                    -- and put your back into it.

                              ALAN
                    You are so goddamn selfish, Vick.
                    You really are. Stu, let's go.

                              VICK
                    No. Stu, sit and enjoy your dance.
          Stu looks between them, torn.

                              ALAN
                    Dude: Doug is missing! We have less
                    than 18 hours til his wedding! We
                    do not have time for this!

                              VICK
                    I'm trying to save your life here,
                    Alan Mervish.

                              ALAN
                    Vick--!

          

                                                                    50.

          

          

                              VICK
                    I'm not kidding, man! Life is one
                    long series of emergencies, and if
                    you don't learn to stop and have a
                    little fun along the way, you're
                    gonna grow into a joyless old prick
                    like your dad. I'm sorry to bring
                    Moshe Mervish into it, but it had
                    to be said. Now yes, we have 18
                    hours to find Doug -- which means
                    we can afford to spend ten minutes
                    celebrating the special talents of
                    these gifted young body-artists. So
                    sit down, have a jager shot, and
                    smell the goddamn roses for once in
                    your miserable life. Chastity,
                    honey? When you're ready?
          Chastity pushes Alan onto the red leather banquette and
          starts dancing for him. He tries to squirm away:

                              ALAN
                    No, look-- I am like totally
                    against this, morally and
                    politically. Plus Becky
                    specifically asked me not to--

                                                         SMASH CUT TO:

          ALAN SITTING ON THE BANQUETTE, LOOKING AWESTRUCK
          as Chastity works a wildly erotic lapdance on him. She crawls
          onto his lap, she whips him with her long hair, she puts her
          tongue in his ear. Next to him, no longer getting lapdances,
          Vick and Stu just sit, staring at Chastity, entranced.

                              STU
                    I think I know why he married her.

                              VICK
                    Because if he hadn't, I would've.
          They continue watching on in silence.

                              STU
                    Is it weird that we're sitting this
                    close watching?

                              VICK
                    Not for me.
          More watching in silence.

          

                                                                     51.

          

          

                               STU
                    I really shouldn't be here. I have
                    daughters.
          Then both of their heads angle the same way.

                              VICK
                    Not that can do that.

                              STU
                    How can she do that without
                    dislocating her hip?

                              VICK
                    Because she's been touched by God.
          They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked
          open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the
          Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our
          guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately.

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    Shit.
          They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized
          by Chastity. Vick grabs him.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Alan, come on, man, we gotta go!

                              ALAN
                    Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses--
          Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette.

                              VICK
                    Come on, man! We got company!
          Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them!

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Chastity, honey, is there a back
                    way out of here?!
          Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to
          a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR.

                               CHASTITY
                    Come on!
          The guys race after her...

          

                                                                    52.

          

          

          INT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY

          Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back
          hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers,
          cocktail waitresses, and barbacks.
          Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are
          slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're
          bowled over by the obese Islanders.

          INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE

          A spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main
          stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing.

                              STRIPPER D.J. (O.S.)

                    ANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS

                    TOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX!
          All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu
          blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons
          look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so.
          The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan
          blow through the curtain after Stu.

                               CHASTITY
                    Come on!
          Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main
          runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits
          the floor running!

                              STU
                    Did she just do that in heels?!

                              VICK
                    I'm really starting to like this
                    girl.
          The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and
          leaping over the patrons!
          Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very
          upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the
          end of the runway clear the hell out of the way.

          CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB
          Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again,
          leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and,
          finally, sprinting out the front door!

          

                                                                  53.

          

          
          The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of
          destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through
          a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however,

          THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS
          being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble
          backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS
          pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground.

                              CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD
                        (to walkie talkie)
                    Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder,
                    we've subdued the targets, over.

          EXT. CRAZY HORSE -- DAY

          Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy
          Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase.

                              STU
                    Did you see them trample those tiny
                    Japanese businessmen?! I think they
                    killed like four of them!
          Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan.

                              VICK
                    Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't
                    just a little fun...

                              ALAN
                    That was...a little fun.
          Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb,
          lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get
          out and hurry for them, pointing, intense.

                              LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
                    Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?!
                    Stuart Pryce?!

                              STU

                        (SCARED)
                    Y-Yes?!

                              LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN
                    You're coming with us.

                                                            CUT TO:

          

                                                                  54.

          

          

          INT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY

          The two LVPD cops, OFFICER MERRIWEATHER and OFFICER BLADEN,
          40's, pace about this bare interrogation room, while Vick,
          Alan and Stu sit behind the cold metal table.
          Vick looks tense, but in control. Stu and Alan are sweating,
          terrified. They've clearly been here a while.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    Where were you last night at 3am?

                               VICK
                    No idea.

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Okay, how about at 2am?

                               VICK
                    Ditto.
          Officer Bladen SLAMS the table with his fist.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    You think this is cute, son?! You
                    think this is a game?!

                              ALAN
                    Whatever we did, we're so sorry!

                              STU
                    Honestly, man, I will confess to
                    anything you want!

                               VICK
                    Stu: stop talking. Alan: sit up
                    straight. Officer Merriweather,
                    I've told you twelve times now: we
                    have no memory of last night. Now
                    either charge us with a crime, or
                    let us go.
          Merriweather scowls and nods at Bladen, who steps over to a
          TELEVISION and turns it on. Merriweather, meanwhile, pulls
          out a photograph of a slick ASIAN MAN in a red suit, slides
          it onto the table.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    What do you know about Jimmy Lang?
          Vick flinches ever-so-slightly, clearly knowing something.
          Stu and Alan just look at the photograph, confused.

          

                                                                    55.

          

          

                                  ALAN
                     Nothing?

                                  STU
                     Who is he?

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                     Jimmy Lang runs the infamous Shiang-
                     Xi crime organization, and is
                     wanted in seven states for money
                     laundering, drug smuggling,
                     racketeering and murder.

                               ALAN
                     Oh my god--

                               STU
                     Did we kill someone last night--?!

                               VICK
                     We have no idea who this man is.

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                     Is that right?

                               VICK
                     Yeah, that's right.
          ON THE TELEVISION, grainy surveillance camera footage of a
          birthday party starts playing. In the video, JIMMY LANG sits
          in an upscale restaurant, in front of a BIRTHDAY CAKE, as a
          table full of hip ASIAN GUYS serenade him with "Happy
          Birthday To You."
          When the guys sitting next to Jimmy lean forward to help him
          blow out the candles on his cake, however, we see that it's
          Vick, ALAN, STU, DOUG, and some BLACK GUY, all very drunk!

                               VICK & ALAN & STU & DOUG (ON TAPE)

                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR JIMMMMY, HAPPY

                     BIRTHDAY TOOO YOOOOU!
          Everyone applauds. Vick drunkenly hugs Jimmy Lang.

                               VICK (ON TAPE)
                     I love you, Jimmy Lang!
          Merriweather FREEZES FRAME on Vick kissing the top of Jimmy
          Lang's shaved head.
          In the interrogation room, Vick, Stu and Alan sit, frozen.
          Silence.

          

                                                          56.

          

          

                              STU
                    We're in a lot of trouble, aren't
                    we.

                              ALAN
                    Officers, I swear, we have no
                    memory of that ever occurring--

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Okay. Maybe a night in jail will
                    jostle something loose.

                              STU
                    Oh no, sir, please don't!

                              ALAN
                    We have a very important wedding--!

                              VICK
                    I know Jimmy Lang.
          Everyone stops, looks at Vick.

                               ALAN
                    You do?!

                              VICK
                    Jimmy and I tried to raise capital
                    for Girl-nasium, a 24 hour fitness
                    center and day spa for tween-age
                    girls, but it never got off the
                    ground. It was an entirely
                    legitimate enterprise -- I had no
                    idea he was a criminal. We must've
                    bumped into him last night, and he
                    must've invited us to join his
                    birthday celebration. No crime in
                    that, is there, Officers?
          Merriweather gets in Vick's face, intense.

                               OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    You actually expect me to believe
                    that dung?

                              VICK

                        (UNBLINKING)
                    Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do.

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    If I find out you're lying to me,
                    son, I will take all of you down,
                    is that clear?

          

                                                                     57.

          

          

                               OFFICER BLADEN
                    You boys wouldn't last three hours
                    in prison.

                                 VICK
                    Stu might.
          Stu shakes his head, unbelievable.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Now: are you gonna charge us with
                    something, or are we free to go?
          The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat.

                              OFFICER BLADEN
                    Get outta here.
          Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door.

                              ALAN
                    Oh, thank you, Officers!

                              STU
                    It was really nice meeting you--!

                              OFFICER MERRIWEATHER
                    If you know what's good for you,
                    you'll get the hell out of Vegas.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

          Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the
          steps of the police station. The mood is grim.

                              ALAN
                    Did you have to be such a dick?!

                              VICK
                    We got out, didn't we?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, four hours later! If we'd
                    just cooperated with them--

                              VICK
                    If we'd cooperated with them, we'd
                    be in jail right now, Alan.
          They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab.
          Desperation is setting in.

          

                                                          58.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    What are we gonna do now? We've got
                    zero leads on where Doug is!

                              STU
                    Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30.
          The guys shake their heads, I don't know.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Do you think he's okay--?

                              VICK
                    Stu, don't. Doug is fine.

                              STU
                    I mean, we were hanging out with
                    mobsters last night, man! They kill
                    people for looking at `em weird--!

                              VICK
                    Stu: Doug is fine.

                              STU
                    Or what if we like drove Doug out
                    to the desert and left him, just as
                    like a funny prank--?!

                              VICK
                    Stu! Enough!

                              ALAN

                        (MUTTERING)
                    I knew I shouldn't have come...

                              VICK
                    What did you just say?

                              ALAN
                    I said I knew I shouldn't have come
                    this weekend, Vick!

                              VICK
                        (getting heated)
                    Is that right?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, that's right. I only came
                    because Doug insisted.
          Vick steps towards Alan, heated.

          

                                                          59.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Why do think you're so much better
                    than us, dude?!

                              ALAN
                    I don't -- I just think I'm better
                    than you, Vick! And trust me, it's
                    not that hard! You haven't changed
                    one bit since high school! Jesus,
                    you're 28 years old and you still
                    talk back to cops?! Really?!

                              VICK
                    You're out of your depth, Alan--

                              ALAN
                    And you're still the one getting us
                    in trouble! Only then it was hiding
                    your weed in our locker, and now
                    you've got us partying with wanted
                    felons! It's not cute anymore, man!
                    We're too old for this!
          Vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    And all your stupid get-rich-quick
                    schemes?! Girl-nasium?! Custard?!
                    In Los Angeles?! Are you joking?!

                              STU
                    Okay, let's all take a breath--

                              ALAN
                    When's the last time you had a real
                    job, man?! When's the last time you
                    had a girlfriend?! Hell, when's the
                    last time you picked up the check?!

                              VICK
                    What's so great about any of those
                    things?!

                              ALAN
                    Those "things," Vick, are what
                    grown men do!
          Vick swallows, furious.

                              STU
                    Look, we're all tired and hungry--

          

                                                                    60.

          

          

                              VICK
                    None of us ever liked you, Alan! We
                    only hung out with you because Doug
                    made us!
          Alan recoils, whoa, stung. This is clearly news to him.

                              ALAN
                    Stu...? Is that true?
          Stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? Alan nods, I
          see, his face reddening.

                              VICK
                    Why would anyone like you, dude?
                    Have you ever thought about that?
                    You're uptight, you're judgemental,
                    you're cheap, and yet somehow you
                    think you're sweeter than everyone
                    else! Well look around, man: no one
                    wants to be you! I'd rather be Stu
                    than you!

                              STU
                    Wait, what--?
          Too late: Alan charges Vick and TACKLES him onto the lawn!
          They roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it
          ends up being a mess of half-chops, pulled hair, and hands in
          each other's faces...

                              ALAN
                    I've...always...hated you...

                              VICK
                    You punch like...your sister...
          Stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.

                              STU
                    Hey, no! Time out! We all need a
                    time out--!
          THUNK! Stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down.
          Alan and Vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat
          the crap out of each other. They could be kids again. Then,
          just when it starts getting way too intense,

          A CAR HORN SOUNDS
          And all three of them look up to see Vick'S BEAT-UP CADILLAC
          parked on the curb, Chastity at the wheel.

          

                                                                   61.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    That might not be like, the
                    smartest place to fight?
          Vick and Alan look over at the huge LAS VEGAS POLICE
          DEPARTMENT sign right next to them. They frown...

                                                              CUT TO:

          EXT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          Vick's car sits parked in front of a country bar.

          INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          The guys sit at a booth, their hair a mess, their faces
          bruised, their clothing ripped, ravenously chowing down on
          TACOS. Stu's mouth is full of food:

                              STU
                    Good call on happy hour, Chastity.
                    These tacos kick ass.

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah, I always come here when I get
                    out of jail.
          The guys exchange a quick look.

                              ALAN
                    Hey -- how'd you start Vick's car?

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh, my daddy taught me how to
                    hotwire almost anything.

                              VICK
                    That's funny, because Alan's daddy
                    taught him tax law.
          Chastity smiles, a little confused. Alan is quick to retort:

                              ALAN
                    And Vick's daddy taught him how to
                    get really drunk at his kid's
                    soccer games and then piss himself.

                              VICK
                    It's a disease, dude--!

                              STU
                    Guys, come on! For Doug?

          

                                                                  62.

          

          
          Alan and Vick angrily continue eating their tacos. Then Stu's
          PHONE rings. He pulls it out, reads the caller ID.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    "Number blocked."

                      VINCE                             ALAN               
          Don't answer it.                 Answer it.

                              ALAN
                    What if it's Doug?

                              VICK
                    What if it's Tracy?!

                              STU
                        (torn, answers phone)
                    Good evening, this is Stu!

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          It's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone.
          Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS.

                              TRACY
                    Stu, it's Tracy!
          His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses:

                              STU
                    It's Tracy!
          Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Why is she calling me?!

                              VICK
                    Because she knows you're the most
                    easily tricked.

                              ALAN
                    We have tell her we lost Doug.

                              VICK
                    No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu!
          Stu turns back to the phone, rattled.

                              STU
                    Hey, Trace! W-What's going on?

          

                                                63.

          

          

                    TRACY
          Oh, nothing, just here with my
          family...

                    STU
          Wow, that sounds amazing!

                    TRACY
          Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen
          to know where Doug is, would you?
          He said he'd be home by 5 for this
          dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I
          tried his cell, but he didn't
          answer...

                    STU
          Ummmm........Hang on.
              (covering the mouthpiece)
          She wants to know where Doug is!

                    VICK
          I'm working on it! Buy us some
          time!

                    ALAN
          No, just tell her the truth!
          Honesty is always the best policy!

                    VICK
          What are you, retarded?! Honesty is
          never the best policy! Especially
          not with brides!

                    STU
              (lamely, to phone)
          Um, what'd you say?

                    TRACY

              (FROWNING)
          I asked if you knew where Doug was.

                    STU
          Yeah, um, hang on.
              (to guys)
          She still wants to know!

                    VICK
          Okay: tell her Alan got really
          drunk last night and fell down, and
          the doctor said not to move him for
          a few hours, but that we'll be back
          in time for the wedding.

          

                                                            64.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Why do I have to be the one that
                    fell over drunk?!

                              VICK
                    It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get
                    over yourself! Stu: tell her!

                              STU (TO PHONE)
                    Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a

                    DOCTOR--

                              VICK
                    Fell over drunk.

                              STU
                    H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a
                    different doctor, not the one he
                    fell on -- he said we couldn't move
                    him until the wedding--

                              VICK
                    For a few hours! We'll be home
                    before the wedding!

                              STU
                    But we're going to have the wedding
                    at your home--
          Tracy just looks really confused.
          Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu.

                              VICK
                    Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon?

                              TRACY
                        (now very concerned)
                    Vick, what is going on?

                              VICK
                    Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen,
                    Alan hurt his back last night, so
                    we're gonna be laid up here for a
                    bit, but I promise we'll have Doug
                    home in time for the wedding, okay?

                              TRACY
                    Oh God, is Alan all right?

          

                                                                  65.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Yes, luckily he had a steel rod
                    surgically implanted up his ass at
                    birth, so the doctors anticipate a
                    complete and swift recovery.
          Alan flips him the bird.

                              TRACY
                    Can I talk to Doug?

                              VICK
                    What? No! No, you can't actually,
                    Doug...Doug is out.

                              TRACY
                    Where is he?

                              VICK
                    Where is he? He's aaaat...the
                    pharmacy. Yeah, picking up Alan's
                    medications. Listen, Trace, I'm
                    losing you, but we'll see you
                    tomorrow, okay? Bye, sweetie--!
          Vick hangs up and nods confidently.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    She bought it.

                                                            CUT TO:

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT

          Back in her bungalow, Tracy hangs up the phone, frowning.

                              TRACY
                    They've done something stupid.
          Her stern father is standing there, frowning.

                              MR. TURNER
                    No surprise there.

                              TRACY

                    DAD--

                              MR. TURNER
                    I'm just saying, what kind of man
                    stands up his fiancée the night
                    before their wedding?

          

                                                                   66.

          

          

                              TRACY
                    Dad, I don't want to hear it. I
                    trust Doug absolutely.
          Mr. Turner backs off. Tracy, however, looks a bit rattled...

                                                         CUT BACK TO:

          INT. THE COYOTE CANTINA -- NIGHT

          The guys get up from the booth and head for the door, grim.

                              ALAN
                    Perfect. We just told Tracy we'd
                    have Doug home in 13 hours, and we
                    still have no idea where he is...
          They pass a DOORMAN on their way out, who's standing with a
          stamp and a UV light reader.

                              DOORMAN
                    Handstamp for re-entry?
                    Handstamp for re-entry?
          Everyone waves, no thanks -- except for Stu, who shrugs, why
          not, and stops, holding out his hand.

                              VICK
                    Maybe we should go back to the
                    hotel and--

                              STU
                    Oh my God, guys! Look!
          Stu holds his hand under the UV light -- it's covered in
          STAMPS from all the clubs they've been to the night before!
          Stu yanks up his sleeve to reveal his ENTIRE FOREARM GLOWS,
          completely covered with stamps!
          The guys hurry back and slide their forearms under the UV
          light, too: they all have the same stamps! Their eyes alight:

                              ALAN
                    It's like a map of last night!
          The guys look at each other, hope returning to their faces!

                                                             CUT TO:

          EXT. LAS VEGAS/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          The guys rocket down the Strip, weaving in and out of
          traffic! All the stamps on Stu's arm are now labelled in
          regular ink. MUSIC blares, and the mood is high.

                              STU
                    Where do you want to start?!

                              VICK
                    At the top! We hit every club we
                    went to til someone remembers what
                    we did with Doug!

                              ALAN
                    Nice clue, Stuey! I can't believe
                    we're actually gonna pull this off!
          Stu grins over at the car next to them. Then he stops.

                              STU
                    Hey: is that guy wearing Doug's
                    hat?!
          The guys look over to see that the DRIVER of the next car
          over is, in fact, wearing the DISTINCTIVE FEDORA-STYLE HAT
          Doug was wearing last night. The guy turns off the Strip.

                              VICK
                    Naaah, couldn't be.

                              ALAN
                    Lots of people have hats like that.
          Stu nods, yeah, I guess...

          TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND
          The first bar written on it is "GhostBar."

                                                         MATCH CUT TO:

          INT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in
          medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the
          club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them
          and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them!
          They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look --
          waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists,
          bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake
          their heads, we have no idea where Doug is...

          

                                                                     68.

          

          

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm...

          INT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The guys and Chastity enter and disperse. Again, everyone
          recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and
          again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm...

          EXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. TAO NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. ICE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and
          unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of
          town, their hopes dimming...

                              STU
                    All right, this is the last place
                    we went, "Chaps."
          Vick rolls to a stop in front of...

          CHAPS NIGHTCLUB
          It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in
          line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear.

                              STU
                    You sure we came here...?
          Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF

          THE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE."

                              ALAN
                    The Golden Pony. That's us.

          

                                                                  69.

          

          

                              STU
                    Maybe I'll just wait in the car--
          But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car.

          INT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT

          The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a
          kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy
          hats and short-shorts grinding on each other.

                              VICK
                    You think we would've remembered
                    this...

                              STU
                    Yeah, I don't think we came here...

                              ALAN
                    Then why is your underwear nailed
                    to the wall?
          The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed
          to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF
          FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS.

                              STU
                    Those could be anybody's. Thousands
                    of people go to Colorado State--

                              ALAN
                        (looking more closely)
                    Oh my God, are they autographed?

                              VICK

                        (READING)
                    "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I     Chaps!"

          

                              STU
                        (realizing, stunned)
                    I am so gay...
          Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling.

                              WAITER
                    Hey, guys! Roger is backstage!
          The guys look at each other, eyes wide.

                               STU
                    R-Roger?

          

                                                                  70.

          

          

          INT. CHAPS -- DANCE FLOOR

          The guys move through the throng of undulating, sweaty men,
          uncomfortable. Alan takes Chastity's hand tightly.

                              ALAN
                    Stay very close to me.
          She smiles and dances through the crowd.

          INT. CHAPS -- BACKSTAGE AREA

          They reach a HUGE MALE BOUNCER guarding the backstage area.
          He sees the guys and unclips the VELVET ROPE, kissing each of
          them on the cheek as they pass.

                              BOUNCER
                    How are Haylee and Kaitlin?

                              STU
                        (totally disturbed)
                    Oh. G-Good, thanks...?

          INT. BACKSTAGE AREA -- DRESSING ROOM DOOR

          The guys reach the dressing room door and stop. They inhale.

                              VICK
                    We're going to love you either way,
                    Stu...
          Stu nods, focussed, nervous, like before a big game.

                              ALAN
                    Some of my best friends are gay.

                              STU
                    Is that true?

                              ALAN
                    Not...not really? I live in
                    Connecticut, man, we don't even
                    have black people yet.
          Stu nods, right. Then, after steeling himself, he enters...

          INT. CHAPS -- DRESSING ROOM

          The dressing room is packed with muscular, tan, buck-naked
          men, walking around, rubbing baby oil on themselves, donning
          chaps and codpieces, getting ready for the next show.

          

                                                                    71.

          

          
          Chastity and the guys move through the mob of beefcake,
          staying ridiculously close together. Vick stops at one
          dancer, trying not to look down at his junk:

                              VICK
                    Excuse me, friend, can you tell me
                    where Roger is?

                              BEEFCAKE COWBOY
                    Oh, hey, Vick! Roger's over there.
          He points to a really hot, really naked guy with a funky
          mullet, stretching out in front of his mirror. The guys
          shuffle over to him. Vick tries to be supportive with Stu:

                              VICK
                    He's cute...I guess...?
          Stu shrugs, yeah, I guess...? As they draw close, Roger sees
          them, and smiles.

                              ROGER
                    Oh! Hey guys!
          He hugs all of them. The guys make sure to keep their asses
          arched back to avoid genital contact.

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    I'm surprised you're even walking
                    yet, Stu.

                               STU
                        (inhaling sharply)
                    Oh my god.

                              VICK
                    Listen, man, we don't really
                    remember what happened last night,
                    can you fill us in?

                              ROGER
                    Really? No memory?
          Stu shakes his head, wide-eyed, scared...

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    Well, I must say, Stu, I'm a little
                    hurt.

                              STU
                    Did we...you know...do anything?

                              ROGER
                    Well, duh? Yeah?

          

                                                                    72.

          

          
          The guys all freeze. A beat. Then Vick pats Stu's shoulder,
          supportive.

                              STU
                    Was I...the boy or the girl?

                              ROGER
                    Oh, honey, you were everything.
          Stu WHIMPERS. Vick and Alan exchange a look, holy shit!

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    But you were nothing like Vick.

                              VICK
                    Wait-- what?!

                              ROGER
                    I know, I'm sort of over group
                    stuff too, but Alan insisted.
          Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned.

                              VICK
                    You insisted?! Why'd you insist?!

                              ALAN
                    I don't know! I don't know why I
                    insisted!

                              ROGER
                    Actually, after the anger went
                    away, it was really quite tender.
          The guys look at each other, nauseous.

                              STU
                    I'm really not sure we can be
                    friends anymore...
          Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING.

                              CHASTITY
                    Guys: he's kidding.
          Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The
          guys all exhale, incredibly relieved.

                              VICK
                    Not cool, Roger. Not cool.

                              ALAN
                    So what did happen last night?

          

                                                                  73.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    Oh, well, you guys came in near the
                    end of our last set, like 2ish.
                    Doug pretty much dragged you in.

                              ALAN
                    Really? Doug did?

                              ROGER
                    Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug.
                    Black guy, shaved head?
          The guys look at each other, confused.

                              ROGER (CONT'D)
                    He's a cake designer, he said he
                    met you guys at some sort of
                    birthday party at the Rio?

                              VICK
                        (snapping his finger)
                    The guy from the Jimmy Lang
                    surveillance video.
          The guys nod, right.

                              ROGER
                    Anyway, for the big finale of our
                    show, we always bring someone on
                    stage, and, well, Stu, you
                    volunteered pretty aggressively.
                        (to nearby dancer)
                    Hey Dallas, do we have the video of
                    last night's show?

                              STU
                    No! That's cool, I don't need to
                    see it--

                              VICK
                    We must see that video.

                              DALLAS
                    It's in the machine.
          Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting
          in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback,
          Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS.
          Roger fast forwards.

          

                                                                  74.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    You were pretty mellow at first,
                    Stu, but once we got you into the
                    chaps, you really came alive-- oh,
                    here it is.

          
          ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I    ROGER" g-string
          and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony
          dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the
          greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo.

                              STU
                    I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym
                    as much as I'd like...

                              ROGER
                    You even taught us The Pony, which
                    we'd never even heard of before...
          ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly
          gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him.
          Stu's face drops.

                               ROGER (CONT'D)
                    And then, of course, the pièce de
                    resistance: the Ride of the
                    Valkyries.
          ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride
          a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild.

                              STU
                    Annnnd that would explain the
                    searing ass pain.

                              ROGER
                    After the show, we split a couple
                    pitchers of flirtinis, you had our
                    stylist cut your hair like mine,
                    and then you split.

                              VICK
                    And what time was all this?

                              ROGER
                    4:30 in the morning? 4:45?

                              ALAN
                    And our Doug was with us?

          

                                                                   75.

          

          

                              ROGER
                    Yeah, he had passed out by then,
                    but you carried him out. It was all
                    very Officer And A Gentleman.
          The guys look at each other, confused.

                              ALAN
                    Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45,
                    we got back to the hotel at 5:00,
                    and Doug was gone by 5:30 when
                    Chastity met back up with us?

                              STU
                    That doesn't make any sense.

                              VICK
                    Did we lose him along the way?

                              STU
                    He was passed out, how far could he
                    have gone--?
          Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads
          "MANDALAY BAY." He answers:

                              VICK
                    Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH:

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          Atashir is on the phone at the reception desk.

                              ATASHIR
                    Mr. Lennon?

                              VICK
                    Atashir, many greetings to you.

                               ATASHIR
                    I thought you might like to know
                    that one of our maids just found
                    your friend, Douglas, passed out in
                    your room.
          Vick's jaw drops.

                              VICK
                    What?! Are you sure it's him?!

          

                                                                  76.

          

          

                              ATASHIR
                    I saw him with my own eyes. He is
                    unconscious but breathing nicely.

                              VICK
                    Oh thank you, Atashir! You are a
                    man of great honor! A thousand
                    blessings upon your ancestors!
          Vick SLAMS his phone shut, overjoyed.

                               VICK (CONT'D)
                    Doug is in the room! A maid just
                    found him! He's passed out, but
                    he's okay!

                              STU
                    They're sure it's him?!

                              VICK
                    Atashir swears it is!
          The guys all laugh, a massive weight lifted.

                              STU
                    Oh thank God he's okay...

                              ALAN
                    After all this?! He's in the room?!
          They keep laughing and hug each other, heartfelt. Vick even
          hugs Roger.

                              VICK
                    I don't even care! Hug me, you big
                    shiny homosexual!

          EXT. CHAPS -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys bound out of Chaps, jubilant. Stu is
          carrying a box of TWO DOZEN VIDEOTAPES.

                              ALAN
                    That was cool of Roger to give you
                    all the tapes of your performance.

                              STU
                    I know, if I actually was gay, I'd
                    totally date Roger first. What a
                    gentle soul.
          They get into Vick's clunker.

          

                                                                   77.

          

          

                              VICK
                    How we doing on time?

                              ALAN
                        (looking at watch)

                    2:22.

                              VICK
                    We'll be in LA by dawn.
                        (firing up engine)
                    I told you bitches this would all
                    work out...
          They drive off into the night, grins all around.

          EXT. THE STRIP/INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT

          Vick drives, Stu sits shotgun. Alan sits in the back with
          Chastity. The cool night air washes over them. They look
          happily exhausted.

                              ALAN
                    This has officially been the
                    craziest weekend of my life.
                        (to Chastity)
                    Thanks for all your help. You were
                    awesome.

                              CHASTITY
                    Anything for my hubby.
          Alan's smile flickers slightly.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    I'm kidding, Alan. I know last
                    night wasn't, you know, real...
          She looks out at Vegas as it flies by.

                              ALAN
                    I'm sorry about all this, Chastity.

                                CHASTITY
                    Jennifer.

                              ALAN
                    Beg pardon?

                              CHASTITY
                    My name is Jennifer. Jennifer Elly.
          Alan hesitates; suddenly she seems a lot more...human.

          

                                                                  78.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    Okay, well, I'm sorry, Jennifer.

                              CHASTITY
                    Oh, don't be. Last night wasn't the
                    first flaky decision I've ever made
                    in my life. I mean, I am a
                    stripper.
          Alan tries not to laugh. She smiles, a twinge sadly.

                              ALAN
                    Where you from?

                              CHASTITY
                    LA. Tarzana.

                               ALAN
                    Oh yeah?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah. I work here on the weekends.

                              ALAN
                    You fly out every week?

                              CHASTITY
                    Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a
                    great school.

                               ALAN
                    Kid?

                              VICK
                        (aside, to Stu)
                    They always have kids.

                              CHASTITY
                    I have a little girl, Sarah.
                    She's... Well, she's everything.
          Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute
          little toddler. Alan smiles.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    What about you?

                              ALAN
                    No kids. Same girlfriend for 14
                    years. Becky.
          Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone.

          

                                                               79.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    Wow, she's stunning.
          Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer:

                              STU
                    We like you way better.

                              ALAN

                    STU!
          Chastity tries to stymie her laugh.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    Becky is great.

                              STU
                    Becky collects teapots.

                              VICK
                    Yeah, she's a total canwego.

                              CHASTITY
                    A what?

                              VICK
                    You know, she's the girl at the
                    party who's always like "Can we go?
                    Can we go?"
          Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head.

                              ALAN
                    She has low blood sugar.

                              STU
                    She has low fun sugar.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm
                    going to marry!
                        (beat, considers)
                    If, you know...she forgives me for
                    cheating on her...

                              VICK
                    Wait: you're going to tell her?

                              ALAN
                    Of course I'm going to tell her! I
                    could never keep something like
                    that from her.

          

                                                                     80.

          

          

                              VICK
                    Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me
                    for scratching her Queensryche CD
                    in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever
                    gonna forgive you for marrying a
                    stripper in Vegas.

                              ALAN
                    Well, then that's just the price
                    I'm going to have to pay.
          Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud.

                              CHASTITY
                    Good for you.
          She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her
          face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment...

                              VICK
                    She's gonna cut your dick off,
                    dude.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT

          Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet
          stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out.

                              VICK
                        (to the valet)
                    Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be
                    right back.

          INT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT

          Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite.
          Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside.

                              VICK
                    Doug! Wake up, man!

          INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- NIGHT

          Instead of finding Doug, however, they find KALOLO FANALUA,
          sitting on their couch, pissed. He's got a huge WHITE CAST on
          his right arm, courtesy of the strip club bouncers.

                              KALOLO FANALUA
                    Aloha, assholes.
          The guys freeze.

          

                                                                  81.

          

          

                                STU
                    Uh-oh.
          The door SLAMS behind them, and they whip around to see
          KIKIOLANI standing in front of the door, blocking their exit.
          He has an identical CAST on his right arm.

                                STU (CONT'D)
                    Not good.
          Just then, a toilet FLUSHES and an immensely large man in a
          red suit exits the bathroom, drying his hands. We recognize
          him from his police photo as crime boss JIMMY LANG, 50's.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Oh, hello. Good to see you again.

                              VICK
                    Where is Doug?

                              ALAN
                    Listen, Mr. Lang, whatever we did
                    last night, we are incredibly sorry-

                              JIMMY LANG
                    These your rich friends you were
                    telling me about, Vick?
          Alan and Stu glance at Vick, confused.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Oh, you haven't told them yet?
                    Really, that's low. Even for you.

                              ALAN
                    What's going on, Vick?
          Vick stammers, trying to find the words...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Six months ago, your friend Vick
                    borrowed some money from me at what
                    can only be described as a very
                    unfavorable interest rate. When the
                    loan came due, he failed to pay me
                    back, but he promised me that he
                    could get the money from you guys
                    this weekend.
          Alan and Stu look at Vick, shocked and hurt.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, Vick...

          

                                                                  82.

          

          

                              STU
                    How could you do this to us, man?
                    We're your best friends...
          Vick looks away, ashamed.

                              VICK
                    They were gonna hurt me, man...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Well, Vick, it looks like you and
                    your friends have some issues to
                    discuss. In the meantime...
          He draws a huge, red-plated .357 MAGNUM.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    I need my goddamn money.
          The guys jump back, whoa! Vick holds up his hands:

                              VICK
                    I can get it! I can! I just--

                              JIMMY LANG
                    I've heard that before, Vick,
                    including last night, when you so
                    rudely skipped out on my birthday
                    party. That's why I've taken some
                    collateral to ensure your payment.
                    His name is Doug.
          The guys all look sick.

                              VICK
                    You have Doug?

                              STU
                    Oh my God...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    If you want your friend to live,
                    meet me at mile marker 26 off
                    Highway 12 at dawn, and bring the
                    money. Are we clear?

                                VICK
                    Yes! Yes.
          Jimmy nods and heads for the door. The Samoans follow him.

                              ALAN
                    M-M-Mr. Lang?

          

                                                                   83.

          

          

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Yes, Mr. Mervish?

                              ALAN
                    H-How much does Vick owe?

                                                              CUT TO:

                              ALAN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    200 thousand dollars?!

          INT. THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER

          Alan and Stu pace about the suite, beyond stressed. Vick
          stands, looking out the window. Chastity gets them all water.

                              ALAN
                    How the hell could you blow that
                    kind of money?!

                              STU
                    Was it for the custard store?

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, Stu, wake up! There is no
                    custard store! Vick was just trying
                    to rip us off to pay back Jimmy
                    Lang!

                              STU
                    Is that true, Vick?
          Vick just stares out at the city, not denying it.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Were any of your deals...real?

                              VICK

                        (GUILTY)
                    Some.
          Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned...

                              STU
                    Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that
                    money meant something to me...
          Vick spins around, furious:

                              VICK
                    Do you really think I wanted my
                    life to turn out like this, Stu?!
                    Do you really think I don't know
                    that I'm a massive loser?!

                              (MORE)

          

                                                                   84.

          

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, you guys got out of high
                    school and you just knew what to
                    do, you went to college and got
                    good jobs and found cool wives and
                    made beautiful children -- what do
                    I have to show for the last decade
                    of my life?! Nothing!
          Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES
          against the wall!
          The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only
                    thing I really have...the only
                    thing I really have is you guys.

                              STU
                    Come on, Vick--

                              VICK
                    No, man, it's true! I put on a good
                    show, but my life is so goddamn
                    hollow and vapid and lonely, it
                    scares me, man. I-I don't know how
                    much longer I can keep this scam
                    going. And now I've gone and ruined
                    the one good thing I had...
          Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    Just...please don't give up on me,
                    okay? I-I don't know what I'd do
                    without you guys. I really don't...
          Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky
          Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in.

                              STU
                    Come on, man, we've been bro's
                    since third grade, it's gonna take
                    a lot more than money to ruin our
                    friendship.
          Vick looks down, deeply touched...

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    What I don't understand is why you
                    didn't just ask me for the money. I
                    would've given you every last cent
                    I had, man...

          

                                                                  85.

          

          
          Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a
          hug. Stu hugs back, emotional.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    I love you, man.

                              VICK
                    Love you too, bro. Love you too.
          They hug tight. For a while.

                              STU
                    Also, I banged your sister
                    sophomore year.
          Vick pulls away.

                              VICK
                    What?!

                              STU
                    Sorry. Just seemed like a good time
                    to tell you.
          Vick stammers at Stu, speechless.

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    She had just broken up with that
                    guy from Central, we were playing
                    "I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool,
                    one thing lead to another--

                              VICK
                    No! No. That's...that's plenty.
          Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan
          just frowns at his watch, stressed.

                              ALAN
                    Look, I'm glad we're all sharing,
                    but we've got three hours to come
                    up with 200 grand, or else...
          The guys nod, frowning, back on point.

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    I'd offer to take a loan out, but
                    it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm
                    pretty sure my bank is closed.

                              STU
                    I think I can get a 20 grand cash
                    advance on my credit card...

          

                                                                     86.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    So that just leaves 180 grand...
          The guys frown at each other.

                              CHASTITY
                    Well, it is Vegas...
          The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...?

                                                       SMASH CUT TO:

          ALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE
          The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides
          over a large pile of CHIPS.

                                                              CUT TO:

          CHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE
          Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS
          grows...

                                                              CUT TO:

          STU YELLING "BINGO" AT A BINGO TABLE
          The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a
          table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face!

                                                              CUT TO:

          ALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE
          looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and
          quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker.

                                                              CUT TO:

          VICK JUMPING UP FROM A WAR TABLE
          having just won! Chastity and the guys aggressively hug him.
          Stu drinks from his glass, hands shaking, wired.

                              STU
                    Time check!

                              VICK
                        (looking at watch)
                    12 minutes.

                              STU
                    Chip check!

          

                                                                      87.

          

          
          Alan quickly counts the chips...

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    Faster! Come on chip check!

                              VICK
                    Dude, how many Red Bulls have you
                    had?

                              STU
                    I stopped counting at six! I can
                    hear my heart beating in my head!
          Alan finishes counting the chips -- and frowns.

                              ALAN
                    Just over 100 grand.
          The guys wince, damn.

                              VICK
                    There's only one thing left to do.
          They all exchange a knowing look...

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

          $100,000 WORTH OF CHIPS BEING PLACED ON BLACK
          at a roulette table. The guys sweat, tense. Stu is insane.

                              STU
                    You sure we don't want red?! What
                    if the ball lands on red--!

                              VICK
                    Shut up, Stu.

                              ROULETTE CROUPIER
                    Betting is closed.
          The Croupier drops the ball into the wheel. It bounces, hops,
          spins... Vick crosses himself. Stu looks away.

                              STU
                    I can't watch! My   heart's gonna
                    explode! Can your   heart even
                    explode?! Because   I think my heart
                    is gonna explode!   I can't watch!
          The ball lands. Dead silence.

          

                                                                    88.

          

          

                              STU (CONT'D)
                    It's red, isn't it?! I knew it!
                    Tell me it's not red!

                              ALAN
                    It's not red...
          Stu turns, ecstatic--

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    It's green.
          The ball has stopped on green, DOUBLE ZERO. Stu clutches his
          chest, like he's having a seizure. Vick inhales, grim. Alan
          slowly drops to his knees. Chastity closes her eyes.
          Their HUGE PILE OF CHIPS is raked off the table...

                                                               CUT TO:

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- PARKING CIRCLE -- PRE-DAWN

          The guys pack their bags into Vick's beat-up Caddy. The mood
          is as dark as the pre-dawn sky. When the car is loaded,
          Chastity takes Alan's hands, gentle.

                              CHASTITY
                    Would you like me to come with?

                              ALAN
                    No...It might get a little
                    dangerous. I wouldn't want...
          He trails off. Chastity nods.

                              CHASTITY
                    I'm so sorry...about everything.

                              ALAN
                    Thanks for all your help.
          Awkward silence. The cold desert wind blows.

                              CHASTITY
                    There's no sense...in exchanging
                    numbers or anything...right?

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, probably not...
          Alan looks genuinely sad.

          

                                                                  89.

          

          

                              CHASTITY
                    Well...I'll always remember you as
                    a great first husband, then.
          They both smile weakly.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    You can just send the divorce
                    papers to the Crazy Horse or
                    whatever...
          Alan nods, okay. Another awkward pause.

                              CHASTITY (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for reminding me that there
                    are still some really good guys out
                    there, Alan. I don't...I don't get
                    to meet too many of them.
          She smiles a bit sadly, kisses him on the cheek, and walks
          off. TIGHT ON Alan's Grandmother's ring still on her finger.
          Alan doesn't remember the ring, however; he's too busy
          watching her walk out of his life, and feeling a real sense
          of loss...
          Then Vick fires up the car next to him.

                              VICK
                    We gotta go, man.
          Alan nods, yeah, and gets in the car...

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- PRE-DAWN

          Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The
          guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared.

                              ALAN
                    Yep, just driving out to the middle
                    of desert to meet some mobsters,
                    what could possibly go wrong...?
          The guys all frown.

                              STU
                    So what's our plan?

                              ALAN
                    I think we should tell Mr. Lang
                    that we couldn't get the money, but
                    that, if he's amenable, we could
                    create a payment calendar--

          

                                                                     90.

          

          

                              VICK
                    We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag
                    of money, grab Doug, and make a run
                    for it.

                              ALAN
                    Yes, good! What an airtight plan--!

                               VICK
                    Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment
                    calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is
                    our only shot of getting Doug back!
                    Left turn!
          Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road.
          Things are quickly going from bad to worse...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN
          streaking across Venice Beach.

          TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 6:04AM"

          INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING

          Tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she
          barely slept. Her father is up, and making breakfast.

                              TRACY
                    Any word from Doug?

                               MR. TURNER
                    Nope.

                        (BEAT)
                    I know you don't want to hear it,
                    Trace, but you deserve better.
          Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress.

                              TRACY
                    I'm sure everything's fine. They're
                    all smart, capable adults...

                                                              CUT TO:

          VICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG
          on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create
          the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20
          bills, but also some $5's and $1's.

          

                                                                     91.

          

          

                              VICK
                    This all the cash we got?
          The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are

          INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN

          The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of
          the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely
          visible in the distance.
          Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to
          disturb the bills, and places it on his lap.

                              ALAN
                    This is the dumbest plan ever.

                              VICK
                    Alan I need you positive please.

                              STU
                    Here they come.
          They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far
          horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up.

                              VICK
                    Stuart?

                              STU
                    Yeah?

                              VICK
                    There's an emergency bottle of
                    tequila in my glove box. Get it out
                    please.
          Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He
          opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a
          pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks.
          They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer.

                              ALAN
                    I can't believe this is how we're
                    going to die...
          The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves.
          The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open...
          TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road...

          

                                                                     92.

          

          
          TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER,
          then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road...
          The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off.
          Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Let's see the money!
          Vick gently holds up his duffel bag.

                              VICK
                    Let's see Doug!
          Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the
          Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back
          and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit.
          The guys look a bit alarmed.

                              ALAN
                    Jesus, what'd they do to him?

                              VICK
                    Pull off the Ralph's bag!
          Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal

          IT'S NOT DOUG
          It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused.

                              VICK
                    Who the hell is that?!

                              JIMMY LANG

                        (ANNOYED)
                    This is Doug!
          He pushes the guy forward.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my God: it's the other Doug!
                    Roger's friend, the cake designer!

                              BLACK DOUG
                        (to Jimmy Lang)
                    I told you, man, I'm Doug Howland!
                    I barely even know these guys!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, you got the wrong Doug, man!

          

                                                                    93.

          

          
          Jimmy Lang and the thugs look exasperated.

                                 JIMMY LANG
                    You sure?!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, man, our Doug is white!

                              JIMMY LANG
                    But you were partying with this guy
                    at my birthday thing!

                              VICK
                    I don't know what to tell you, bro,
                    this isn't the Doug we requested!

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Well. I apologize for the mix-up...
                        (drawing his HUGE GUN)
                    But I'm still gonna need my money.
          Vick and the guys start backtracking towards their car.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my God Oh my God Oh my God...

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Don't move, Vick.
          Vick freezes, duffel in hand, as Stu and Alan slink from
          view. Jimmy reaches Vick, gun calmly trained at his head.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Now please. Give me my money.
          All eyes on Vick, anxiously clutching the bag in his hand...
          Sweat beads on his brow...

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Don't be stupid, son. You--
          Then Vick throws a hard left hook, SLAMMING Jimmy square in
          his massive stomach! And

          NOTHING HAPPENS
          Jimmy is built like a tank. Vick freezes, oh shit. Then Jimmy
          PISTOL-WHIPS Vick -- his lip explodes with blood and he falls
          to the ground.

                              VICK
                    Christ that hurts!

          

                                                                     94.

          

          
          Then Jimmy picks up the duffel bag. Hefts it. Feels wrong. He
          goes to open the zipper when he hears:

                               STU

                     AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!
          Jimmy looks up to see Stu insanely charging him like the
          linebacker he once was! Jimmy raises his gun, but

          STU TACKLES JIMMY TO THE GROUND FIRST!
          The gun flies free and they wrestle for it! Dust flies!

          BACK BY THE YUKON
          The two Guamians fumble for their guns -- but it's difficult
          with huge CASTS on their shooting hands!

          ON BLACK DOUG
          He sees what's going down, and, his hands tied behind his
          back, takes off sprinting towards Vegas!

          BY THE CADDILAC
          Alan looks around, what should I do?! What should I do?! Then
          he spots the keys in the ignition of the car. He hops in and
          fires up the engine! Just then

          THE TWO GUAMIANS OPEN FIRE
          Bullets pound into the Cadillac! Alan ducks down, terrified,
          and floors the gas!

                               ALAN
                     I'm being shot at! I'm being shot
                     at!

          UP AHEAD
          Jimmy Lang throws Stu off of him and recovers his gun,
          panting. He cocks it, aims it at Stu on the ground.

                               JIMMY LANG
                     I really didn't want to kill anyone

                     TODAY--
          Then WHAM! Alan drives the car into Jimmy Lang at 25mph!
          The obese mobster is pitched off his feet, and lands a good
          ten yards away, in a heap of dust!
          The guys freeze, shocked.

          

                                                                  95.

          

          
          The Guamians freeze, shocked.

                              ALAN
                    Oh my god, is he okay?!

                              VICK
                    Who cares! Go go!
          Alan floors the car while Stu and Vick SPRINT and DIVE in!
          The caddy peels the hell out of there, kicking up rocks and
          dust! The Guamians FIRE after them!

          BULLETS IMPACT ALL ALL OVER CAR
          taking out the tail-lights, the windshield, the headrests.
          The guys duck down til they're sufficiently far away. Then
          they sit up, amazed, out of breath.

                              STU
                    I can't believe you just saved my
                    life!

                              VICK
                    I can't believe you just drove my
                    car into Jimmy Lang!
          Alan drives, his eyes as big as saucers.

                              STU
                    He's gonna be really upset!

                              ALAN
                    Yeah, I was just thinking that!

          BACK ON JIMMY LANG
          The huge mobster lies face-down on the desert floor. His two
          henchmen waddle up, highly concerned.

                              KIKIOLANI
                    Boss, Boss, you okay?!
          Jimmy sputters into the dirt, furious.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Find Vick... And kill him.

          INT. VICK'S CAR -- DAWN

          The guys race down the dusty highway in traumatized silence.

                              ALAN
                    Now can we call Tracy?

          

                                                                  96.

          

          
          Vick frowns and blots his split lip with his sleeve.

                              VICK
                    Yeah. It's probably time.

                                                            CUT TO:

          EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- LONE PAYPHONE -- DAWN

          The guys pull up at a lone, dusty payphone in the middle of
          the desert. They all look at the phone.

                              ALAN
                    Who wants to make the call?
          Beat. Then Vick reaches for his nose, odd man out. Stu and
          Alan immediately reach for their noses, too. It's close.

                              STU
                    That was you!

                              ALAN
                    What?! No! I beat you by a mile!

                              STU
                    Vick, who won?!

                               VICK

                        (FROWNING)
                    Actually...I should do it. This
                    weekend was mostly my fault. I need
                    to Man Up.
          Alan looks shocked -- and impressed -- by Vick's newfound
          sense of responsibility.

                              ALAN
                    Well, I'll be damned...
          Vick grabs the bottle of Patron, takes a long swig. Beat.

                              VICK
                    I still can't believe Stu banged my
                    sister.
          Vick hands the bottle to Alan, gets out, and makes for the
          pay phone...

          Tracy is putting on her makeup in the bridal suite. Her stern
          dad blows in.

          

                                                                     97.

          

          

                              MR. TURNER
                    Any word from Doug?
          The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know
          about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law.

                              TRACY
                    No, but I'm sure he's--
          Just then, Tracy's CELL PHONE rings. She quickly answers it.

                                TRACY (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

          INTERCUT WITH:

          VICK
          In the desert, on the pay phone, looking through his busted
          aviators into the rising sun.

                              VICK
                    Tracy, it's Vick.

                                TRACY
                    Hey Vick!

                              VICK
                    Listen, honey...The bachelor party
                    got a little out of control and,
                    well...we lost Doug.

                              TRACY
                        (her jaw dropping)
                    What?! But we're getting married in
                    like four hours!

                              VICK
                    Yeah, that's not gonna happen...

          BACK IN THE CAR
          Alan starts to take a pull of Patron -- when he freezes,
          realizing something!

          BACK TO VICK
          on the phone with Tracy, being genuinely contrite.

                              VICK
                    Look, I'm really sorry, Trace. This
                    is all my fault--

          

                                                                    98.

          

          
          Suddenly, Alan flies out of nowhere and snatches the receiver
          out of Vick's hand!

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    What the--?!
          Alan gets on the phone with Tracy, his heart racing.

                              ALAN
                    Tracy, it's Alan! Hey, Vick is just
                    joking around! We've got Doug right
                    here!
          Vick looks like: what?!

                              TRACY

                        (HORRIFIED)
                    What kind of joke is that?!

                              ALAN
                    I know, Vick is such a prick! We'll
                    see you at the wedding! Bye!
          Alan hangs up and races back to the car. Vick follows.

                              VICK
                    What are you doing?

                              ALAN
                    I know where Doug is!

          Alan floors the car back onto the 15 towards Vegas, amped!

                              ALAN
                    Remember when we saw Doug's bed
                    impaled on the griffin thing?!

                              STU
                    Yeah, we threw it out the window.

                               ALAN
                    No: the windows don't open,
                    remember?!

          

                                                         99.

          

          

                               VICK
                    So how did--?

                        (REALIZING)
                    Oh my God.

                              STU
                    I don't get it.

                              ALAN
                    And that's why we've been seeing
                    Doug's clothes all over Vegas! He
                    was trying to signal someone!

                              VICK
                    I don't believe it...

                              STU
                    I-I still don't get it--

                              ALAN
                    And it totally jives with the
                    timeline, right?! We brought Doug
                    back to the hotel at 5:00, he was
                    passed out...

                              VICK
                    It's so obvious!

                              STU
                    Not...to me...so much?

                              VICK
                    How'd you figure it out?!

                              ALAN
                    The Patron, man! It reminded me of
                    our first drink of the night!

                              VICK
                    Honestly, dude, you're a genius.

                              STU

                    CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE

                    DOUG IS?!

                              VICK
                    He's on the roof!
          Stu looks confused, the roof?

          

                                                                    100.

          

          

                               ALAN
                     After Doug passed out, we must've
                     taken him up there in his bed as a
                     prank, so he'd wake up on the roof
                     or whatever? Then we forgot him.

                               VICK
                     And all day he's been throwing his
                     crap off the roof, trying to signal
                     someone to get him down!

                               STU
                     You think he's still up there?!

          The guys race through the lobby at top speed.

          EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- ROOFTOP -- DAY

          The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black
          tar roof. It's empty.

                               ALAN

                     DOUG?! DOUG?!

                               VICK

                     WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?!
          But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair...
          Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent,
          naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink
          from sunburn...

          IS DOUG!
          And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed!

                               ALAN

                     DOUG!

          Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and
          whispers, nasty, parched:

                              DOUG
                    Don't...even...talk to me.
          The guys stop short.

          and clutching an arm-full of BOTTLED WATERS, through the
          hotel lobby. Alan is arguing into his cellphone.
          As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over:

                              VICK
                    Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?!
                    Why did you betray us?!

                              ATASHIR
                    Because they paid me. And also
                    because you're kind of racist.

                              VICK
                    Fair enough! See you next time, you

          They blow out of the hotel...

          Vick is at the wheel, leaning on the HORN, keeping the three-

          he doesn't hesitate to drive in the shoulder.
          In the backseat, Doug chugs bottled water, still simmering.

          sliding door and, wind whipping his face, throws a huge
          PACKAGE over to Alan, who stands and catches it! Vick nods at

                              MR. TURNER
                    I'm sorry, honey, but I think you
                    need to seriously consider that
                    Doug might not be coming...
          Tracy stops short, speechless.

                               MR. TURNER (CONT'D)
                    Some men just aren't cut out for
                    this kind of commitment. I'm so
                    sorry that this is how you had to
                    find out--
          Just then, we hear a car SQUEALING UP outside...

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB

          The Bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby, waiting, anxious.
          Just then, the doors blow open and

          VICK, ALAN, STU, AND DOUG
          stride inside! Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a
          mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here.

                              VICK
                    Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy
                    route. We ready to do this thing?
          The bridesmaids sit up, stunned.

                                                             CUT TO:

          TRACY AND HER FATHER
          walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy
          looks tentative. Her father frowns, not at all happy...

          IN THE AUDIENCE
          Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos...

          AT THE ALTAR
          The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug:

                              VICK
                    She looks beautiful, man.

          

                                                                 105.

          

          
          Doug still doesn't speak to him.

                              VICK (CONT'D)
                    That's cool. I get it.

          TRACY
          reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess
          of emotions. They hug.

                              TRACY
                    I love you, Daddy.

                              MR. TURNER
                    I love you too, pumpkin.
          Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat
          in the first row.
          Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him,
          angry, hurt:

                              TRACY
                    Where were you? And why are you
                    pink?

                              DOUG
                    It's a long story. All I can say is
                    I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as
                    long as we're married, I will never
                    ever put you through something like
                    this again.
                        (desperate, pleading)
                    Can... Can you forgive me?
          Tracy studies his face, searching...
          All the guests wait with bated breath...
          The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on...
          Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him.
          He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The
          groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists.
          The Minister clears his throat.

                              MINISTER
                    We, um, we traditionally wait til
                    the end for the kiss...?
          But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing...

                                                 MATCH DISSOLVE TO:

          

                                                                    106.

          

          

          DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING
          at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding.

          CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED
          and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn,
          where white tables and a dance floor have been set up.

          STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION
          Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the
          bride and the groom.

                              VICK
                    We did it, fellahs. We pulled it
                    off.

                              ALAN
                    I never had a doubt.
          They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen
          him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their
          first dance on the dance floor.

                              STU
                    You think Doug's ever going to talk
                    to us again?

                              VICK
                    Give him time.

                              ALAN
                    Yeah. Like a decade or two--
          Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder.

                              STU
                    Uh-oh.
          The guys all look over to see

          BECKY
          Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate.

                              VICK
                    Hey Beck--!

                              BECKY
                    Shut up, Vick! Alan, where the hell
                    have you been?! I've been calling
                    and calling! What, you don't answer
                    your phone anymore?!

          

                                                                    107.

          

          
          Alan shrinks down, back to being the chastised boyfriend.

                               ALAN
                     I-I'm so sorry, I can explain--
          Then there's a WOMAN'S VOICE behind them.

                                 WOMAN'S VOICE
                     Alan?
          They all turn to see

          CHASTITY
          standing behind them in a very sexy, very elegant dress, her
          hair back. She cleans up nicely. Alan swallows, whoa.

                               VICK
                     This just got complicated...

                                 ALAN
                     Jennifer?
          Chastity smiles that he called her by her real name.

                               CHASTITY
                     I-I know I wasn't invited, but I
                     just had to return this...
          She hands Alan his GRANDMOTHER'S HOLOCAUST RING. Becky
          watches on, stunned.

                               BECKY
                     Okay: who the hell is this chick,
                     and why the hell does she have your
                     Grandmother's wedding ring?!
          Alan looks back and forth between Becky and Chastity...
          It's the moment of truth. The fork in life's road...

                               BECKY (CONT'D)
                     Talk, you moron! Jesus, you're just
                     like your mother! Talk! Who's the
                     ho wearing my ring?!
          And in that moment, it all becomes so clear. Alan turns:

                               ALAN
                     She's my wife.
          Becky's jaw drops. Chastity smiles slightly. Stu and Vick
          grin, oh shit!

          

                                                                 108.

          

          

                              ALAN (CONT'D)
                    We don't make each other happy
                    anymore, Beck. And we can keep not
                    making each other happy for another
                    14 years -- hell, maybe even
                    another 50 years -- but let's not.
                    Let's find people who make our
                    hearts race. Let's be excited and
                    fun and alive again...
          Alan looks at Becky, sincere, honest. Beat.

                              BECKY
                    Are you fucking kidding me?
          Alan shakes his head, sadly, no.

                              ALAN
                    I'm sorry, Beck. I really am.
                        (to Chastity)
                    Can I buy you a free drink?
          Chastity smiles, takes his arm, and they walk off together
          towards the bar.

                              CHASTITY
                    We're not...actually...still
                    married, are we?

                              ALAN
                    Let's start with dinner, and see
                    where it goes...?

                              CHASTITY
                        (smiling warmly)
                    I'd like that.

          BACK ON BECKY
          She finally recovers enough to speak:

                              BECKY
                    Alan! Alan Steven Mervish, get back
                    here this second!
                        (but Alan keeps walking)
                    Don't you walk away from me, you
                    stupid little clown! I own you! GET

                    BACK HERE IMMEDIATELY!
          But Alan just keeps walking away with Chastity. Vick and Stu
          wave him on, go dude! Go!
          Then Becky turns on them. Beat. They both scatter, terrified.

          

                                                                    109.

          

          

          STAY WITH STU
          as he hurries off through the crowd. After a moment, he

          HEARS:

                              VOICE
                    Daddy?!
          Stu turns to see his TWO ANGELIC DAUGHTERS in sundresses
          racing through the crowd towards him! They leap into his
          arms, so excited to see him! He scoops them both up.

                              STU
                    Oh, I missed you guys so much!

                              HAYLEE
                    We missed you too, daddy!

                              KAITLIN
                    You're the best dad ever!
          Beat.
          And then Stu just starts BAWLING. Tears everywhere.
          His lovely wife ERIN appears, harried, a diaper bag over her
          shoulder, and sees him crying. She rolls her eyes.

                              ERIN
                    Jesus, are you still drunk?
          Stu shakes his head, no, and keeps SOBBING as he pulls her
          into a big family hug...

          INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- LATER

          Vick, a cocktail in hand, his tie undone, heads into the
          men's room and approaches a urinal. Then KIKIOLANI and KALOLO
          FANALUA walk in behind him, still in their huge arm casts,
          still very pissed. Vick inhales, scared.

                              VICK
                    Okay, okay, I'll go with you.
                    Just...don't ruin the wedding.
          Then JIMMY LANG enters the bathroom on RED CRUTCHES.

                              JIMMY LANG
                    I really didn't want it to end like
                    this, Vick.
          Vick nods, resigned, and starts towards him. Then Jimmy
          extends his hand for Vick to shake.

          

                                                                   110.

          

          

                                 JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Good luck.

                              VICK
                        (totally thrown)
                    Um, what...?

                              JIMMY LANG
                    Your friend Alan just paid your
                    marker. Took out a second mortgage
                    on his house. The full 200 grand,
                    plus medical expenses, which I
                    thought was a classy touch.
          Vick looks blown away.

                              JIMMY LANG (CONT'D)
                    Without our friends, we are
                    nothing, Vick. Remember that.
          The three injured mobsters exit. Vick remains standing there,
          overwhelmed, his life literally saved...

                                                          DISSOLVE TO:

          VICK, STU, AND ALAN
          standing on the cliffs overlooking the Pacific, drinks in
          hand, as the wedding reception rages on behind them.

                              VICK
                    I will pay you back, you know.

                              ALAN
                    Damn straight you will!
          They all LAUGH.

                              VOICE BEHIND THEM
                    Okay, so what the hell happened
                    this weekend?
          The guys turn to see Doug approaching, smiling. They grin as
          he falls in with them, looking out at the calm blue ocean.

                              VICK
                    Well, Alan married a stripper, Stu
                    went gay, and I learned a very
                    important life lesson from an obese
                    hoodlum.

                              STU
                    We'll tell you the whole story when
                    you get back from your honeymoon.

          

                                                                   111.

          

          

                              ALAN
                    We really are sorry, man.
          Doug nods, I know. Vick raises his cocktail.

                              VICK
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              STU
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              ALAN
                    To Doug and Tracy.

                              DOUG
                    To me and Tracy -- and to being
                    here, with my three former best
                    friends in the world...
          The guys LAUGH.

                               DOUG (CONT'D)
                    There's nowhere else I'd rather be
                    right now.
          They nod, heartfelt, hear-hear.

                              DOUG (CONT'D)
                    That said, let's not get too stupid
                    tonight, okay? I'm going on my
                    honeymoon in 24 hours...
          The guys all nod reassuringly.

                              THE GUYS
                    No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally,
                    dude.
          The guys exchange a sly smile, CLINK glasses, then

                                                         CUT TO BLACK.


         THE END

    SPACE

    Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching
    between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense
    cosmic ocean.

                    MUMBLE (VO)
          You ever feel small?

    Moving in on....

    PLANET EARTH

    The spinning blue marble.

    FADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the
    familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto
    ANTARCTICA


    THE ICE SHELF

    Vast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few
    small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us.

                    MUMBLE (VO)
          Like you're no-one, cos the world is full
          of us, and everyone's the same

    Wait a minute. These aren't humans... they are PENGUINS!

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          How do you stand out from the crowd?
          How do you find someone special?

    A GREAT COMMUNITY

    EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand
    central station - with everyone SINGING to each other.

                    MUMBLE (VO)
          I know. I know. "You sing your heart
          out." That's how mum found dad in the
          first place

    Follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive
    crowd past an assortment of crooning males


                                                    (CONTINUED)

                         KEEN MALE

             "Babe...I got you Babe..."

She ignores him

                       NEXT MALE
                 (giving it his all)
             "When a man loves a woman..."

She keeps moving, until she sees the male of her dreams:

                       WISHFUL
             "Love me tender love me true, all my
             dreams fulfil.

He stands a bit apart from the rest. And what a voice. What a
hip movement. She sings along.

                       NORMA J. AND WISHFUL
             ...for my darling I love you and I always
             will.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             With them it was love at first song.

Close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine.

                       MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
             But with me everything was a different,
             right from the moment I was born


THE ICE SHELF

With infinite care, THE EGG is passed from Norma J's feet
onto WISHFUL's.

                       MUMBLE
             First rule of survival: get yourself laid
             before winter.

WISHFUL covers the egg, glancing up at the darkening sky

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Apparently I only just made it.

Women are leaving and heading off over the ice. The community
resounds with sad songs of parting.


                                                       (CONTINUED)

             Afterwards Mum went off to the sea to
             keep warm. Dad stayed home like dad's do,
             incubating.

Norma J is having difficulty tearing herself away. Finally
she pads off after the others.

                       WISHFUL
             Safe home baby....

As he watches her dwindle into the distance, where huge STORM
CLOUDS are building.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
             I'll miss you.

THE DARKNESS

Wind comes shreiking across the ice shelf to where THOUSANDS
OF MALES are huddled, ice crusting on their feathers.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Tell me what it is about the cold and the
             dark. Soon as the sun goes away, everyone
             gets religious

The huddled penguins are engaged in ritual chanting

                       LEAD VOICE
             When all others leave...

                          CHORUS
             We Remain.

                       LEAD VOICE
             When the Sun vanishes...

                          CHORUS
             We Remain.

INSIDE THE HUDDLE

The adult males are packed shoulder to shoulder, looking
downwards at the eggs balanced on their feet.

CU on the Lead male, a CARUSO




                                                     (CONTINUED)
                                                              4.
CONTINUED:

                       CARUSO
             Deny the pangs of hunger.
             Seal the gaps. Share the warmth....

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Caruso's the leader because he's so
             incredibly old. Some say more than 40,
             but you know how penguins exaggerate.

OUTSIDE

WINDWARD PENGUINS peel off and walk around to the leeward
side. WISHFUL is among them

                       CARUSO
             ....Each one taking his turn to defy the
             wind.

WIDE SHOT

The MASSED VOICES rise above the gale, the frosty plumes of
their breath forming a shared `thought bubble'...a benevolent
ÜBERPENGUIN.

                       CARUSO.
             ...As we invoke the Great One, Penguin of
             Penguins

                       WISHFUL
                 (pushing back inside)
             OK. Invoke. But keep moving

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             My dad was never that devout. Often his
             mind was on other stuff.

As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next
to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J

                       NORMA J.
                 (Sings)
             "I wanna be loved by you, alone and
             nobody else by you boo boo pee doo"

WISHFUL raises his head, breaking the seal. A little puff of
steam escapes

                       WISHFUL
             Amen to that honey


                                                        (CONTINUED)
                                                            5.

                       VARIOUS PENGUINS
             Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, pal!
             Ya lettin' out the heat!

Penguins around him start jostling to close the gap

                       PENGUINS
             ...Quit shovin'!
             ...Hey watch where you're putting your
             feet

                       CARUSO
             Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions!

An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE.

                       WISHFUL
             Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg!

WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and
waddles back into the warmth again.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
             S'okay. S'okay. No harm done.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             I guess he was wrong about a lot of
             things.

Pulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned
out by the HOWLING GALE.

                       WISHFUL
             But I did learnt this from him:    the
             power of positive thinking

We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the
Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts.

Louder and louder, until...

                       ELDER
             By the power of our Devotions...

                       ALL PENGUINS
             We turn the world once more.

                       ELDER
             By our devotion to the Wisdoms


                                                      (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

                    ALL PENGUINS
          We bring back the sun.

The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the
sound of the gale, and, as if in response

THE EARTH TURNS!

The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins
to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The
vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more.

ON THE ICE SHELF

The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing.

A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks
again.

The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at
the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs.

Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier
and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same
time...

THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY

An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like
POPCORN.

Fathers are calling out to each other as their fluffy CHICKS
emerge to greet the daylight.

                          EXCITED FATHERS
          ...It's   a   boy!
          ...It's   a   girl!
          ...What   a   peach!
          ...What   a   bruiser!

Amongst the excited crowd of males and hatchlings we find
WISHFUL staring down at his egg still balanced on his feet.

                    FRIENDLY PENGUIN
          Late opener, huh? You thinks its alive?

                    WISHFUL
          I'll say. Listen...



                                                    (CONTINUED)

He taps the egg with his beak. Bending close they hear a
TAPPING SOUND in REPLY.

                       FRIENDLY PENGUIN
             Well, how about that?

WISHFUL taps again. The tapping comes back louder. A TINY
FOOT pops out of the egg. Then ANOTHER. The Egg flips and
lurches off in a giddy DANCE.

                       WISHFUL
             Whoa li'l buddy, slow down!

THE FRIENDLY PENGUIN'S chick giggles at the DANCING EGG,
which finally trips and cracks, depositing baby MUMBLE.

                       MUMBLE
                 (hopping from one foot to the
                  other)
             Ow! Freezy, Fuh-Fuh-Freeezy! All Freezy!

                       OTHER PENGUINS
             ...Jees!
             ...You ever see a chick move like that
             before?
             ...is he damaged?
             ...is he deranged?

They gather round staring down at this strange little jigging
ball of fluff

                       WISHFUL
             What? Come on. He'll grow out of it.

Shovelling MUMBLE off the ice and into his BROOD POUCH.

                       WISHFUL (CONT'D)
             Come here, li'l Mumble. Let's get you
             warm and toasty.

Mumble SNUGGLES contentedly between his father's legs,
surveying his new world. The friend's chick, ELLA is staring
at him fascinated

                       ELLA
             Get him to do it again Daddy

                          FRIENDLY PENGUIN

          So What happens now, Dad?

                    WISHFUL
          We Wait


THE ICE

A LONG LINE of male penguins, thousands of them, all with
their chicks, stand staring expectantly across the ice shelf.

At the front, we find WISHFUL and MUMBLE, who is jiggling
with anticipation, hopping from one foot to the other.

                    MUMBLE
          Is she coming soon?

                    WISHFUL
          Any day now.

                    MUMBLE
          Tell me again what she's like

                    WISHFUL
              (sings)
          a wiggle when she walks, a giggle when
          she talks, makes my world go round....

MUMBLE does a little SOFT SHOE SHUFFLE.

Caruso waddles past: A stern glance down at little Mumble as
he carries on along the line

                       WISHFUL
             `Cos it ain't penguin.

LATER

MIST rises off the ice shelf. The males are still waiting
with their chicks. Over this: The sound of Chicks crying.

MUMBLE between his father's feet, follows his father's
concentrated gaze.

                       MUMBLE
             Gee I'm hungry

                       WISHFUL
             Everyone's hungry son. The mommas are
             bringing fish soon.

Long pause

                       MUMBLE
             What's fish look like.

                       WISHFUL
             You'll see it when she brings one

STILL LATER

The baby penguins are HOWLING now.

Anxious fathers lean forward, peering into the distance.

Out of the thickening mist, a cluster of little BLACK DOTS
materialises.

                         PENGUIN LOOKOUTS
             ...Wives-ho! Wives-ho!
             ...Hubba-hubba! Wives-ho!
             ...Better late than never.

The distant females look exhausted as they totter unsteadily
across the ice towards their partners. The MALES break ranks
and rush towards the distressed females.

                         MALE PENGUINS
             ...Barbra-Ann!

Weaving anxiously through the throng, overhearing:

             You're not as fat as I thought you'd be.

                       FEMALE#1

              (overcome)
          O Honey. O Baby. You made it!

She staggers into his waiting flippers.

                      WISHFUL (CONT'D)
          You hurt?

                    NORMA J.
              (breathless)
          Just tired and hungry is all.
          It was dreadful out there....

Over WISHFUL' shoulder, she sees the infant Mumble HIPPITY-
HOPPING towards them.

                    NORMA J
          But who's this.

                    WISHFUL
          I called him Mumble.

Mumbles feet start to tap involuntarily, Then he catches his
dad's warning look.

                    MUMBLE
          Did she get one. Did she bring one back.

                    NORMA J
          Just a little krill that's all

                    MUMBLE
          Can I see it?

                    WISHFUL
          Later, bud. Give your ma time to
          regurgitate

                    NORMA J
          Aw. But isn't he just a darling?

                    MUMBLE
              (yells ecstatically)
          I got one! I got a mum everyone. I got a
          MUM!!

THE GREAT COMMUTE

The ICE-SHELF is as busy as a freeway at peak hour with males
and females are hurrying BACK AND FORTH from the sea.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             After that, with food being so scarce
             everyone was busy busy busy. Mom and dad
             were working so hard I didn't see much of
             them. Besides I had school to go to.

THE CRECHE

An efficient, caring TEACHER is giving a lesson to a class of
about thirty young chicks grouped in front of her.

                       TEACHER
             Settle class. Settle. We will begin with
             the most important lesson you will ever
             learn. Now does anyone know what that is?

MANY flippers go up.

                        TEACHER (CONT'D)
             Michael?

                       MICK
             Don't eat yellow snow?

                       TEACHER
             True but, that's not it. Mumble?

                       MUMBLE
             Swimming? Catching Food?

                       TEACHER
             Anyone else?

Mumble looks astonished. What's more important than that

                       ELLA
             It's our Heartsong, Miss.

                       TEACHER
             Your Heartsong. Yes. The melody you hear
             inside, the thing that makes you
             different from every other penguin. So.
             Let's all be very still now and listen.
             And when you hear your song, let it come
             out. Who's first.

                       TEACHER
             Well Michael, if you think that's really
             you. What have you got for us, Ella?

                       ELLA
                 (sings)
             Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...ce soir?

                       MUMBLE
                 (laughs)
             That doesn't make any sense.

                       TEACHER
             Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better

                       MUMBLE
             Mine is more sort of a...

He hesitates, as if listening to something in his head.Then,
he sings UTTERLY TUNELESS, like a drum solo.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom

                       TEACHER
             You heard that in there?

Mumble is still going. TITTERS and SNIGGERS from the class.

                       MUMBLE
             You like it?

                       TEACHER
             Dear, that's not even a tune.

                         MUMBLE
             It's not?

                       TEACHER
             No, a tune is like...
                 (she sings a scale)
             La la la la la la la la.

                    MUMBLE
          Oh, La la la la la

A croaky monotone.   The class LAUGHS OPENLY.

                     TEACHER
              (getting worried)
          Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la
          la la la!!

The class fall about in HYSTERICS.

                    MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
          Whats funny?
              (genuinely perplexed)
          What's funny?

LATER

MUMBLE's PARENTS are talking to the TEACHER.

                    TEACHER
              (sotto)
          It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did
          anything happen - you know...- during early
          development?

                    NORMA J.
          No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't
          it honey?

Wishful shuffles guiltily.

                       WISHFUL
          Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter
          I guess, and he did hatch a little late,
          but...
                 (at a loss.)
          Is there really nothing we can do?

                       TEACHER
             Of course there is. Thats why we have
             Mrs Astrakhan.

MRS ASTRAKHAN'S

Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS
ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher.

                       MRS ASTRKHAN
             CAN'T SINK? Rubbeesh. Every little
             pengvin has a sonk. Vhen I have
             feenished, your singink vill be givink
             everyone the goosepeempel.

CU on MUMBLE looking up.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             So. Closink the eyes. Liftink chin. Deep
             breathe here in the downbelow. Now...most
             important part, find a feelink. Happy
             feelink, sad feelink, maybe lonely
             feelink.

MUMBLE closes his eyes.

                            MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             So?...So?...

                       MUMBLE
             I'm thinking.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Don't think EET!! Feel eet!
             Through the whole body, from the beak
             right down to tippy-toes.

Her voice is seductive, hypnotic.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             And then slowly, very slowly...

She hears a strange TAPPING sound and looks down.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             Vhat? Vhat is this?

                            MUMBLE
             What?

             not move muscle.
             Rigid like plank, like board. NO
             MOVINK!!!
             Now...calm. Remember the feelink.

                         MUMBLE
             Feelink...ok.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             And be spontanuous.

Once again his feet start twitching uncontrollably.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             No! Stop! No jiggy-jog!

                       MUMBLE
             I'm being spontanuous.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Not with the feet, with the sonk!
             You vant to meet beautiful girl?
             You vant to make the Egg?

                        MUMBLE
             Oh yes.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Well singk! "Ba Ba Bleckship,
             tvinklestar...La la la la la la, la".

                       MUMBLE
                 (totally unmusical)
             "Twinkle, twinkle, little star. How I..."

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN
             Hokay. Enough. Stop. Hokay! Ve go back to
             the top. Forget the body, look inside the
             soul. No notes, no sonk, only feelink.
             Happy feelink. Sad feelink. Enormous
             feelink, so enormous it fills the whole
             body. It must escape or you explode! Now,
             open your leetle beak...

Mumble opens his beak, inspired.

                       MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
             Yes, yes, lift up the head! That's it!

Mumble inhales, his eyes are shining, his body is shaking.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
          You take a big breath, good and...now! Now!

He's off again, DANCING LIKE A FOOL...wild, exuberant, totally
uninhibited and unselfconscious.

After some time, he remembers himself, stops and turns to the
Mrs Astrakhan who is BANGING HER HEAD against a lump of ice.

                    MRS ASTRAKHAN (CONT'D)
          Disaster! Catastroff! I never fail!
          Never!

THE ICE SHELF

Follow Mumble as he wanders alone, back towards his class.

He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who
are now performing with increasing virtuosity.

Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the
wind.

Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever
be able to sing like that.

                    MUMBLE
          Its tough when you realise you'll never
          fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult

A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          I couldn't face the class in this mood So
          I just kept going.

Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony
head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice,

Gradually the colony begins to thin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Looking for what? I don't know? A
          different type of penguin?

The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and
looks up.

             And that's exactly what I found.




THE EDGE


Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with
broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins
here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird.

A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to
himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around
himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings
angrily..."There's no business like show business.

CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony
and then back out over the wasteland

                       MUMBLE
             Not the nicest place in the world but at
             least you could do what you liked here.

Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off,
skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing
to his hearts content until....

a shadow passes over him and

Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel
flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him.

                       SKUA
             Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird?

                       MUMBLE
             Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing?

THREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded.

                       SKUA#1
             Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch.
             Hey hey hey...

                 (to others)
             Leg or wing?

Their dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy
and backs away.

                       MUMBLE
             But ...but. I'm a penguin.

                        SKUA#1
             Exackly! De flipperbirds - dat's you -

             Right now D'ain't no fish -- so...you do the
             math.

The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE.

                       FIRST SKUA
             And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits.

                       MUMBLE
             I don't have juicy bits! Look...
             all bone and feather! Feel for yourself.

They fall over each other, fighting to take up Mumble's
invitation.

                       SKUAS
             ...Hey, break me off a piec'a dat!

The Skuas stop momentarily.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Every seen anything like this?

He does a wild little TAPDANCE hoping to distract them.

                       FIRST SKUA
                 (unimpressed)
             Nope.

He knocks Mumble down and places his HUGE CLAW on his chest.

                    FIRST SKUA (CONT'D)
          Ok boys, for once we gonna do dis
          civilised. Now...

The FIRST SKUA opens his beak to strike. Mumble has noticed a
YELLOW PLASTIC BAND around the Skua's leg.

                    MUMBLE
          Hey! What's that on your leg?

The FIRST SKUA halts his attack.

                    FIRST SKUA
          Interesting you should ask?

                    OTHER SKUAS
          No! No! Don't startim on that!

He turns and whacks the other SKUAS over the head with his
wing.

                    FIRST SKUA
          Shaddap! The flipperbird aksed me a

He opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls
into a narrow CREVICE in the ice.

             Hey! Whatcha think ya doin' down dere

The other Skuas move in to help. MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK
as they spear at him with their beaks.

             ...Come on, out witcha!
             ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird!

They can't get hold of him. Frustrated, they turn on the
FIRST SKUA, squabbling and whacking each other with their
wings.

MUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and
argue viciously among themselves

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Compared with that, school almost seemed
             like fun

THE CRECHE

MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young
penguins are taking school lessons.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Most days I hid at the back, dreaming
             about the world beyond

MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the
unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs
into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again
into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with
bulging eyes and tentacled hands.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             But right up to graduation I never did
             find my heartsong


LATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY

Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted
to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers
underneath.

They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead
penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent

                       CARUSO
             Graduates, today you leave the safety of
             our community for the first time,
             forsaking the trusted solid ice for the
             terrible magic of the deep.

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Caruso. He couldn't help himself.

                       CARUSO.
             Things are not as they were. For five
             years now we have known nothing but
             famine. But you are our hope. Upon your
             survival depends the very future of the
             entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim
             far. May the Great Penguinus go with you.
             And remember...

With solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air
and shouts.

                       CARUSO
             Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah!

AWAY FROM THE CRECHE

Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult
plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a
bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head
which has not yet moulted off.

Music Over: Schools Out by Alice Cooper

          Dad? I'll learn to sing later. I'll find
          my voice out there. In the deep. Truly.

Glancing round he sees the class moves off en masse across
the ice...heading for the sea.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Dad. Pul-eeeze.

Wishful leans forwards, pulls off Mumbles tuft with his beak.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Yeooow!!

He races off, Norma J calling after him:

          Remember `Stranger Danger'! Never talk to

Mumble turns to wave, falls over, gets up and races on after
the others with his strange hippity-hop little gait.

THE HIGHWAY TO THE SEA

A high shot reveals the miles of frozen ice that the
GRADUATES have to cover to get to the sea.

Some are shuffling along on their feet; others are
tobogganing.

A long way behind them we see the lone figure of MUMBLE
racing to catch up.

AT THE EDGE OF THE ICE

The juvenile penguins stand in a bunch, peering down looking
for somewhere to dive in.

                         GRADUATE PENGUINS
             ...What do you think, here?
             ...Are you kidding?
             ...How about over here then?

They shuffle off in a group to a nearby spot.

                         GRADUATE
             ...That last place looked better.

                        OTHERS
             ..I agree.
             ..Much better.

They all shuffle back to the previous spot and stand there,
frozen by indecision

                       GRADUATE
             ...then again....

Suddenly the little dark figure of MUMBLE barrels through the
pack, yelling

                       MUMBLE
             Outta my way flipperbirds! Coming
             through!!

For a long moment he's airborne.

Then...he hits the water with a strangled squawk!...and
disappears.

                         GRADUATES
             ...What was that?

                        ELLA
             Mumble?

They tentatively crane over the edge. No sign of him. They
peer into the water.

                       GRADUATE
             ...Lunatic!
             ...where did he go?
             ...See any blood?

Then...MUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile...

                         MUMBLE
             Whatcha waiting for? It's
             fantast...(splosh)

... as he falls back under water again.

                       ELLA
              Go Mumble!

Without hesitation ELLA follows him.

The others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en
masse leap yelling and hollering.

SURFACE/ UNDERWATER

The penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking

                       MUMBLE
             I had an instinct I'd be good at this.
             Actually we all were. We were the best.
                                                             27.


UNDERWATER

Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they
swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles.

Over this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS.

                        BEACH BOYS
             "Suntanned bodies and the waves of
             sunshine.
             Those California girls and the beautiful
             coastline.
             In the warmed up weather, let's get
             together and do it again..."

Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE...

THE SURFACE

Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a
breathless heap on top of each other.

                         ELLA
             Mumble?

                         MUMBLE
             Ella?

They scramble to their feet...but the ice is slippery.They
clutch together, slipping and sliding.

                         ELLA
             Woah!

                       MUMBLE
             I've got you! No I don't.

Leaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close
now, eyes meeting.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Yes I do.

A brief moment then.

                         MALE PENGUIN

As others pop up all around

             ...Ella!
             ...Where da get to?
             ...there you are!

Laughing, she dives into the water. The young males follow
her. MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after
her.

UNDERWATER

A half dozen of them gambolling together, their bubble trails
intertwining...

                       BEACH BOYS
             "In the warmed up weather, let's get

Then everyone freezes as a few silvery FISH swim past.

                         MUMBLE
             ...FISH!!

They all zero in.

Collisions, barging, a bit like water polo when the ball is
first thrown in. In an instant...all the fish are taken.

ON THE SURFACE

MUMBLE surfaces with a fish in his beak

                       MUMBLE

                       MALE PENGUIN
             Why don't I have it


Suddenly, A SKUA BIRD swoops down and grabs it.

                       ELLA
             Hey! That's a felony! Mumble, let go!

Mumble hangs on. Neither he not the Skua will let go. The
SKUA soars higher, taking MUMBLE with him.

                       ELLA (CONT'D)
                 (yells)
             Mumble!

MUMBLE is carried...higher and higher. The SKUA tries hard to
shake him off, but finally gives up.

                       SKUA
                 (derisive)
             So fly flipperbird. Fly.

He lets go the fish and MUMBLE plummets downwards, landing
Splat! on an ice floe.

ON THE ICE.

Mumble lies still

Ella and the others gather around. MUMBLE still has the FISH
firmly in his beak.

                       PENGUINS
             ...Is he breathing?
             ...he's certainly not eating

Leaning forward to take the fish

                       PENGUIN
             ...Maybe I should just...

Mumble regains consciousness

             Take it. Really. Its for you

ELLA leans forward, takes the fish, and daintily gulps it
down.

                          ELLA

ON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT

The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the
AURORA AUSTRALIS.

The PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing:

                       ELLA AND THE OTHERS
             "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations
             a happenin' with her, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh..."

The HARMONIES are exquisite until...

                   (very loud and tuneless)

             ...Mumble,

                 (gently)
             Mumble, the thing is...

                       MUMBLE
             I know. I know

                       ELLA
             ....It's better if you just listen.

She returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect
harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE.

                         ELLA AND THE OTHERS
             MUMBLE!!!

                       MUMBLE
                 (retreating)
                 OK! I'll quit. OK!

AN ICE-FLOE

We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the
others on their iceberg.

As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an
exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE.

TIME LAPSE

As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely
floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current

Music Over: "The tracks of my tears"

MORNING

He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice.

                       MUMBLE
                 (sleepily)
             Woah. Whose there.

Another nudge.


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                          32.
CONTINUED:

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             OK. I'm awake now. You got me

He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over
the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples.

A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his
balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Saw you. Richard? Eddie? Ella....

The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS
missing Mumble by an inch.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             ......aaarghH!

As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER.

UNDERWATER/ SURFACE

Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get
back onto the ice.

                       MUMBLE
             Everybody out!! LEOPARD SEAL!! (glub)

The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows
of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life.

The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller
floes, powering around larger ones.

Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into
the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support
his weight.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             HEEEELP!!

Mumble scrambles to gain purchase but FALLS BACK INTO THE
WATER. Now he is ...

UNDER THE ICE SHELF

...caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless
black WATER below.



                                                     (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the
angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS.

The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about
to engulf Mumble when...

a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble
makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply.

He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it
rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast.
MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air...

THE ICE-SHELF

A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes
out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL.

WHAM! THUMP! They belly-flop on the ice .

                         THE ADELIES
                   (wincing)
             ...Ouch!
             ...That's gotta hurt!
             ...Who ordered seal?

Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's
reach. The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors

                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Over here
             ...No over here. Too slow!
             ...have to lose some weight pesado

The frustrated Leopard Seal snaps and snarls impotently.

                         MUMBLE
             Yeah go chase someone your own size, ya
             big.......blubberhead.

Taunting it with a cheeky little TAP DANCE. The Adelies love
it.

                       AN ADELIE
             Hey, amigo. Do that again!

                        MUMBLE
             Do what?
                 (defensive)
              I didn't do anything.

                        AN ADELIE
             That thing with The feet.
                 (to the others)
             ¡Hola muchachos!
             (to Mumble)
             Show them!

                          MUMBLE
             Well...I just kind of go ...like this...and
             then this...

Bolder now, he does a few neat steps.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...¡Oye! Ritmo Cubana!
             ...¡Riba Riba! Shake those hips!
             ...Yo penguino, bust a move!

They COPY HIM, improvising little riffs on his dance step.
The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Then mebbe something like...
             ...No. I got it. Watch me!

An Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own. The LEOPARD
SEAL is almost upon them.

                       MUMBLE
             Or how about ...

MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL
strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face
comes down hard on the ice

                         THE ADELIES
                   (to the winded Seal)
             ...Eat my ice, lardface.
             ...Kiss my frozen toosh, rubber butt

They fall about laughing. The Leopard Seal returns to the
water.

                       LEOPARD SEAL
             I know where you live.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Yeah, it's called The Land, tubby.
             ...Flop back anytime!

Laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off.
MUMBLE watches them go.

                       ADELIES
             ...Hey, ain't you coming, tallboy?
             ...Or you got something better to do?

MUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes,
all the way to the horizon. Nothing...

He shrugs and hurries off after his new friends.

FURTHER ON

A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and
MUMBLE crest the rise, to see...

ADELIE LAND

A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of
them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio,
very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony.

                       MUMBLE
             Wow, there are so many of you!

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Hey, this is nothin'.
             ...Used to be twice as many of us.
             ...Yeah, back when you could still catch a
             fish.

                       MUMBLE
             The shortage has affected you too?!

                       AN ADELIE
             ...Who you calling shortish?
             ...All I know is a lot of us
             ain't comin' back.
             ....And Some folks so hungry they eating
             rocks

Sure enough An ADELIE walks by, a PEBBLE in his beak.

                         THE ADELIES
                   (laughing)
             ...Eating rocks!!?
             ...That is major funny.

                       MUMBLE
             Why funny? That's terrible

                         ADELIES
             ...Just kidding the rocks are for nest-
             building
             ...That's how its works here. The one with
             the most rocks gets the chicas.
             ..Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom
             BOOM!

                       MUMBLE
             So why aren't you guys collecting them

                         THE ADELIES
             ..Cos we got personality!.
             ...Without us the chicas got no boom boom.
             ...Without us the fiesta will be a siesta..
             ...Watch and learn tallboy.

One of the Adelies calls to a pair of YOUNG FEMALES he sees
walking by.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Hola Conchita!

The Adelies pose, RUFFLING UP THEIR CRESTS into various
styles: the MOHAWK, the FLAT-TOP...

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...See something you like?

...trying to top each other, they add HIPPITY-HOPS they've just
learned from Mumble. The females are intrigued.

                       A FEMALE
             Hey. Cool. Where'd you learn that?

                         THE ADELIES
             ...The big guy.
             ...He from out of town.
             ...He with us.

                       FEMALE
             Do it again.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Sorry Show's over.

          ...You see. Some penguins got it, some
          don't And the Amigos, (in unison) WE GOT

They punch and bump each other playfully.

                      MUMBLE
          ....you think I could get some of it?

                     AN ADELIE
          Hombre, you got so much already, you
          dangerous.

He touches Mumble and recoils as if burnt

                    ADELIE
           Yow!

                    MUMBLE
          You really think so?

                      THE ADELIES
          ...You got the biggest personality of any
          of us.
          ...Except for me, maybe.
          ...Put that ego away, Ramon, you gonna hurt
          someone.

THE CONGA LINE

Music over: Carlos Santana's "Oyé Como Va".

                    MUMBLE (V.O.)
          So for a while I forgot about finding a
          song altogether.

The Adelies and Mumble form a conga, weaving in and out of
the nest builders, aiming a kick here and there at their
industrious brethren
                                                          38.


UNDERWATER

                       MUMBLE
             ...We were a team

the Adelies swoop and dive, corralling a FEW SMALL FISH into
a CREVICE.

The fish, darting to and fro are suddenly confronted by
Mumble's OPEN BEAK.

ON THE ICE AGAIN

Mumble shares out the catch

AN ICEBERG

                       MUMBLE
             ...there was so much to do, so much to
             see

Mumble and the adeles come shooting down a long curving
Slippery dip

                       THE ADELIES
             ...¡Arriba!
             ..Addidas amigos!

As they shoot off the slippery-dip and into the sea mumble
whacks his head on the edge of the ice

UNDERWATER

The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks,
slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the
surface recede.

Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom"

ON THE SURFACE

                       ADELIES
             ...Where's the tall-boy
             ...I thought he was with you.

They jump back in to look for him
                                                           39.


UNDERWATER

Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral-
like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light.

                        MUMBLE
             ....stuff down there beyond my wildest
             imagining.

Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of,
An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier.

It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem.

Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then
ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST.

INSIDE THE BULLDOZER

A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard.

He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the
sound it makes.

OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER

In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES
congregate.

                        THE ADELIES
             ... You sure he went in there?
             ...Mumble!
             ...Done go near it, looks like it can
             bite

One of them smims closer to the great jaws

                         ADELIES
             Ramos!

Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws

                       MUMBLE
             Oh! There you are

Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like
missiles.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Guys!    I want to speak to you.
                                                         40.


THE ICE SHELF

The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their
little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them

                    ADELIES
          ...Forget it
          ...We're not going back there
          ...Never

                    MUMBLE
          But its dead. It can't hurt you

                    ADELIES
          ...Maybe its got a brother still alive.


                    MUMBLE
          But that's what we have to find out.
          Don't you see. Things like that could be
          eating the fish.

The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their
tracks.

                    ADELIES
          Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and
          ask the revered one.

                     MUMBLE
          The who?

                    THE ADELIES
          ...Reverend Loveday.
          ...The One who Knows
          ...First we gonna need stones though

                    MUMBLE
          Why stones? Wait for me

LOVEDAY'S MOUND

MUMBLE and the ADELIE AMIGOS are bunched together, near the
head of a LONG QUEUE of Adelies each with a stone or in their
beak.

At the head of this queue stands LOVEDAY - guardian of a huge
pile of pebbles. His head pokes through one of the rings a
PLASTIC SIX-PACK CAN HOLDER festooned with seaweed like a
HOLY MANTLE.

A group of Soul singers, mainly female, sway in the
background, singing a soulful song of adoration as the
Penguin ahead of Mumble steps forward.

                       LOVEDAY
             First, the devotion...

The PENGUIN adds his pebble to the pile.

LOVEDAY holds up a flipper for silence and a hush falls over
the gospel choir

                       LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
             A moment...
                 (composing himself)
                 ... and your question?

                       FIRST IN QUEUE
             Señor Loveday, My wife is one of the
             Disappeared ones Tell me is she alive?

Loveday hyperventillates, his eyes roll up in his head

                       LOVEDAY
             The Mystic Beings are speaking to me.
             Yes! She is alive and happy and you are
             in her thoughts...

                       FIRST IN QUEUE
             But is she with another male?

                       LOVEDAY
             One pebble, one question. Next!

The AMIGOS push MUMBLE forward. He is at least a head taller
than the others.

                         LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
             I sense...you are the one with the
             question.

                         ADELIE
             ...How does he do it?
             ...He just one look and he know.

Mumble places the pebble on the pile. A long Pause

                        LOVEDAY
             A little nervous? That's normal. Take

In fact Mumble is mesmerised by the luight catching LOVEDAY's
six pack holder. He bends forwards to study it more closely

                    MUMBLE
          I was wondering. Have You ever been
          abducted by Aliens?

                    LOVEDAY
          No time wasters. Next!

                      THE ADELIES
          ...Señor! That's not his question. He's new
          here.
                (prompting Mumble)
          ...The yellow thing
          ...Ask him what's taking the fish?

                    MUMBLE
              (ignoring them)
          ...you see I met a Skua once, with
          something like that on his legs....

                    LOVEDAY
          ...Skua? Leg? What's he talking about?

                    MUMBLE
          ... and he said he was abducted by
          Aliens.

                    LOVEDAY
              (starts to wheeze and cough)
          Listen friend, this is my Sacred
          Talisman, bestowed upon me by the Mystic
          Beings...

                    MUMBLE
          Looks like they bestowed it very tight.

                    LOVEDAY
          ...during my Epic Journey of
          Enlightenment to the Forbidden Shore!

                    MUMBLE
          So these Mystic Beings, did you see them?

                    LOVEDAY
          I hear them. They talk to me all the time
          I am their instrument. They chose me
          to......

                    MUMBLE
          Did they have frontways eyes? No
          feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they
          probe you and stick a pointy thing into
          you?

                    LOVEDAY
          Enough! How many questions is that? You
          don't have enough pebbles.


                      ADELIES IN QUEUE
          ...Yeah, one pebble, one question.
          ...We've all got stuff to ask, pal!

                    MUMBLE
          But I haven't had any answers yet!

                    LOVEDAY
          SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are
          speaking. They say show some respect
          stranger. Especially to the One who
          Knows.

A hush falls over the gathering.

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
          The reason there are not enough fish is
          simple: There is not enough love in the
          world. Love is the answer!

One cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
              (over this)
          Okay, everybody, turn around to the
          penguin next to you and give them a great
          big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a
          safe place.

The gathering hug awkwardly. Mumble, because of his towering
height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him.

                    LOVEDAY (CONT'D)
          Now. The Mating Season starts today so
          here's what everybody should do: go forth
          and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself
          must retire for a moment to the couch of
          indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be
          first

MUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of
FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him

                    FEMALE ADELIES
          ..Me Loveday.
          ..Me!
          ..No Me !

          ...Did he say it starts today
          ...why didn't someone tell us.
          ...We gotta get to work guys!!

They start posturing for the any FEMALES they can attract

                      THE ADELIES
          ...¡Hola Baby! Get your chica boom-boom
          here.

A couple of females look up from the scrum

                    FEMALE
          ...How many rocks you got.

                    HER FRIEND
          ...Forget `em honey. They only one
          between the six of them...and they just
          spent it.

                    AN ADELIE
              (getting desperate)
          Wait. Look.

The Adelies all start DANCING MADLY, but it is too frenetic,
too desperate.

                     ADELIES
          ...You like it

Rejected, the Amigos stop dancing.

                      THE ADELIES
          ...Their loss, guys.
          ...Ramon, where you going?

Ramon is SEARCHING frantically for PEBBLES.

                    RAMON
          Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere!
              (to Mumble)
          Hey big guy, got any love stones over
          where you come from?

                    MUMBLE
          We don't collect them. All we have to do
          is , well... We sing

                    AN ADELIE
          ...Easy as that?
          ...So why aren't you over there?

Mumble looks at them. Then opens his beak and demonstrates:

          See. That's how I ended up with you guys.
          And emperor who can't sing isn't an
          emperor at all.

                    AN ADELIE

THE EMPEROR COLONY

It is autumn, the EMPEROR PENGUINS for the mating season.

It is just like the GREAT GATHERING we saw at the beginning
of our story. Males and females sing their Heartsongs. And
ONE SONG stands out from all the others.

Where NORMA J. once sang, stands ELLA, now sleek and fully
mature. Gathered around her in a semi-circle, a half a dozen
adoring MALES.

                    ELLA
          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir?
          Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

Suddenly she becomes aware of a MELLIFLUOUS MALE VOICE
overlapping hers. It has a curious bossa nova rhythm.

                    MUMBLE
          Tall and tanned and young and lovely
          The Girl from Ipanema goes walking
          And when she passes each guy she passes
          goes `Aaaah'

Ella turns to see: a PENGUIN backlit by the sun, standing
HEROICALLY on a little rise, just as WISHFUL did.

Ella recognizes those TAPPING FEET. Could this be MUMBLE?She
moves closer to investigate.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Oh, and I want her so badly
          How can I tell her I love her?
          Yes I would give my heart gladly

             She looks straight ahead not at me...."

                          ELLA
             Mumble?

                       SINGING VOICE
             Tall and tanned and young and lovely..

                       MUMBLE
                 (overlapping)
             Hi Ella, what do you think?

Ella, suspicious moves to one side. Mumble moves to block her
view. She moves further tound and sees:

                       THE ADELIE
             ¡Hola bonita!

Obviously he's been singing while Mumble mimes

                       ELLA
             Mumble, that's just cheap

She turns and heads off. The Adelie starts after her.

                         THE ADELIE
             Wait up! You and me baby, we can make
             sweet music. I may be short but I'm a
             love god...Ooww!

Mumble smacks him with the back of a flipper and goes off
after Ella himself.

                       MUMBLE
             Ella. Wait!

She stops. He takes her by the shoulders Shes upset.

                          MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             I'm sorry.

                       ELLA
                 (shakes her head, tearful)
             When you left without saying goodbye I
             thought something had happened, then I
             thought he just doesn't care.

                     MUMBLE
          Don't care? I never stopped thinking
          about you.

                    ELLA
          And then when I saw you singing, for a
          second I thought...

                    MUMBLE
          I can't sing.

                    ELLA
          I know. I know. Its impossible.


She walks off.

                    MUMBLE
          But I'll show you something better

He TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Sing something to this!

                    ELLA
              (her back to him)
          What's the point. It's embarrassing

                    MUMBLE
          Just try it. This once.

Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and
without conviction.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going.

The singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic

                      THE ADELIE
          "...turn around you fool
          You know I love you more and more..."

Right on cue, the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of
him, singing back-up.

                    THE ADELIES
          "Tell me why is it so
          Don't wanna let you go
          I never can say goodbye, no...no no no..."

Curious, ELLA TURNS.

Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it
for a moment... then lets rip.

He TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES
accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS

FEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to
improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps.

Now ELLA is caught up in it. AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO
PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE!

                    MUMBLE
          This is it Ella! This is the song inside
          me!

ELLA is ecstatic. Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be
swept up into the abandon. A DARK FIGURE steps forward

                        CARUSO
              (bellows)
          STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!!

ELLA STOPS DANCING. MUMBLE misses a beat, loses his footing,
trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO
and the ELDERS.

                    CARUSO (CONT'D)
          WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS
          ABOMINATION?!!

          It is exactly this kind of disrespectful,
          heretic behaviour that has brought the
          Scarcity upon us! Don't you see...we are
          being brought to account by the

          Wait. Wait. You think it's my fault that
          there are no fish?!! Doing Happy Feet
          can't cause a food shortage.

                    AN ELDER
          ...then what did?!

                       MUMBLE
          My own opinion? I think living beyond
          the ice there are creatures we've never
          met before Aliens. Mystic Beings. Big,
          flabby......

            No, Son they're right.

Wishful emerges from the crowd

Catching up with him

                      MUMBLE
            Its no use Ella. I can't live with that.

                      ELLA
            Can you live without it?

He stops.

                    ELLA (CONT'D)
          I believe in you, Mumble. But without the
          huddle we can't make an egg. Without the
          egg, what are we here for?

                    ADELIES
          ...True
          ...That's a big question

                    MUMBLE
          Guys. Can Me and Ella be alone for a bit

The Adelies give them space

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          OK. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm
          going to talk an alien. I'm going to find
          what's causing the shortage

                    ELLA
          But what about?...

                    MUMBLE
          Its the only way. You're right. Unless
          we have food theres no future for any of
          us - you, me the adelies, anyone

                    ELLA
          But...

                    MUMBLE
          Give me a year, just until the next great
          gathering. If I don't make it back ....at
          least I tried

                    ELLA
          But...

                    MUMBLE
          Now go back. I love you. Go.

ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and
the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist.

THE ICE SHELF

Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind,
trekking homewards

                       ADELIES
             Tell me again where we're going.

                       MUMBLE
             To find the mystic beings.

                       ADELIES
             How do we know where they live.

                       MUMBLE
             We'll ask Loveday. He's been there.

ADELIELAND

Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and
Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at
them.

                       MOTHER
             ...Not so close. We got babies on board

                       ADELIES

They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE
PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...LOVEDAY, you okay??
             ...what happened
             ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin?

MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him.

                       MUMBLE
             Just one question! And I want a straight
             answer! Where do I find the Mystic
             Beings?

LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling
rumbles from his throat.

                       AN ADELIE
             Why don't he speak?

LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC
round his neck.

                         AN ADELIE (CONT'D)
             Talisman...sounds like Talisman!!

LOVEDAY coughs. His eyes bulge.

                         ADELIES
             ...He's possessed!
             ...It's a seizure!

                       MUMBLE
             No. He's choking! The Talisman's gotten
             way too tight.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Why din' you say so?
             ...Hold on we gonna take it off.
             ...You pull that side, I pull this side.

They tug at the SIX-PACK PLASTIC. LOVEDAY GASPS AND WINCES.

                       MUMBLE
             Stop. You're hurting him.

The Adelies back off.

                    AN ADELIE
          Any better?

LOVEDAY gives a little `so-so' gesture with his flipper.

                      THE ADELIES
          ...It not gonna come off.
          ...Of course it's not! It's sacred!

                    MUMBLE
          LOVEDAY, where did you get it?

                      THE ADELIES
          ...It was bestowed on him.
          ...By the Mystic Beings!

LOVEDAY shakes his head sadly.

                    MUMBLE
          They didn't bestow it on you?

                       THE ADELIES
          ...Poor Guy.
          ...He don't know what he's saying.

                    MUMBLE
          If it wasn't bestowed, what happened?

LOVEDAY mimes swimming.

                         THE ADELIES
          ...Oh, this one's easy.
          ...He swam....
          ...On his Hectic Journey of Delightenment...
          ...To the Forbidding Shore.

                    MUMBLE
          And then....?

LOVEDAY mimes the talisman going over his head.

                      AN ADELIE
          ...Well to me that's gotta be bestowing.

LOVEDAY shakes his head, `no'. He stretches his neck.

                    MUMBLE
          You looked up and...... It just got caught
          around your neck?

LOVEDAY hangs his head. A TEAR slides down his beak.

                    MUMBLE
              (gently)
          Loveday, did you ever meet a Mystic
          Being? Really?

Beaten, LOVEDAY shakes his head `No' The Adelies are stunned
into silence.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          But this thing was made by someone. And
          if we find them, they could take it off.

LOVEDAY looks up, a glimmer of hope in his eye.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          So where do we Go, Loveday

Loveday Then he makes a strange "Oi, Oi, Oi" sound.

                    AN ADELIE
          Oh my! Now he thinks he's an Elephant
          Seal

LOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains.

                    AN ADELIE (CONT'D)
          He wants to go to the top of the
          mountain.

LOVEDAY shakes his head.

                       MUMBLE
          The forbidden place is over the
          mountains...

LOVEDAY nods.

                      MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          ...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!?

LOVEDAY gestures wildly with his flippers!

          So who's coming

                     LOVEDAY
          Oi

A MOUNTAIN RIDGE

The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging
behind, breathing hard.

Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the
climb.

Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother.

                    ADELIES
          ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it
          ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even
          close.

Then on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'.

                    MUMBLE
          Hear that?!

As they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the LAND of
the ELEPHANT SEALS. Thousands of them.

                        THE ADELIES
          ...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat
          penguin?
          ...No, no...jus' krill and fish.
          ...Sure of your facts are you?

Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side,
slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES
follow.

                    ADELIES
          Well I guess we're about to find out

THE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS

The beach is literally heaving.

MUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to
two HUGE SEALS.

             Well roll me over and call me a dugong.
             What the heck have we got here

The Adelies bunch up behind Mumble

                       MUMBLE
             Excuse me, we need directions...to the
             Forbidden Shore.

             Sure. Just git yourselves over them there
             hills I'd come with you myself but...

             over them hills, beyond the great
             glacier, `n' through the blizzard
             country.

The Good Ole Boys are into ONE-UPMANSHIP.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 1 (CONT'D)
             Anyhow. Its its forbidden to go there.

                       ELEPHANT SEAL 2
             I heard its forbidden to ask how to get
             there!

             Aliens, the ones who made this.

He indicates the SIX-PACK PLASTIC around LOVEDAY'S neck.

SEAL 1 lowers it's massive head down to face LOVEDAY.
Wheezing he examines the plastic with first with one eye,
then the other, before announcing his verdict.

          Could they be taking our fish?

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 1
          Could be!? I heard they'd take a whole
          penguin, rip its skin right off and turn
          it into mush.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 2
          Huh! That's a Picnic! I hear tell they'd
          take a baby seal and club it to death.
          With their bare clubs.

                    ELEPHANT SEAL 1
          Huh! Clubbing's a Clambake! My Granpappy
          says they been known to skin a seal from
          snout to tail in a hot second.

          Stop! I'm hearing voices. The mystical
          guys. They say:
          "Your life is perfectly good as it
          is...forget this stupid mission".

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY keep trekking.

                    ANOTHER ADELIE
          Ramon. That was embarrassing, man.

And reluctantly, he trails after them. As do...

                      THE OTHER ADELIES
          ...Oh no, don' do this to us.
          ...I'm a lover not a fighter
          ...The first sign of Popsicles or funfood
          of any kind, I turn round and go back


THE BLIZZARD COUNTRY

MUMBLE, LOVEDAY and the ADELIES are tiny specks, struggling
over a series of great ridges.

                    MUMBLE
          So we walked ... and walked .. and kept
          walking. Over the hills and into Blizzard
          country

A SNOW STORM breakes over them. A screaming wind brings total
WHITE-OUT. The Penguins have to shout to make themselves
heard.

                      THE ADELIES
          ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin!
          ...We should be migrating out to sea by
          now!

             Huddle??!

             Form a moving circle! Share the cold,
             share the warmth!

He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a
STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Oh yeah, nice.
             ...That's definitely better.
             ...Good call big guy.

                       MUMBLE
             I said a circle!

They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from
the upwind position, the Adelies complain.

                         AN ADELIE
             ...No, no. This can't be right!
             ...It was better the other way.

They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops
the FULL BLAST of the GALE.

He gives up and marches off into the driving snow.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Hey!
             ...What happened to the Huddle?!

                        MUMBLE
                  (shouts back)
             Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have
             to!!

The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their
fronts

                        THE ADELIES
             ...Oh no, now I got chest pain
             ...tell you, this is a good way to get
             snow blind

          ...just keep moving or you'll get my beak
          up your butt

FLARE OUT TO WHITE

The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness.

One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards
to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance.

They have finally reached the sea again

                    MUMBLE
          You think this is it? The Forbidden
          Shore?

LOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'.

                    ADELIES
          ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten"
          shore
          ....So what are those black things?.

Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings

AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION

The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing-
sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned,
and half concealed by snow.

Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting
twisted METALWORK.

                    MUMBLE
          Hello?! Is there anyone out there?

An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the
wind.

                     MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Hello!!

                      THE ADELIES
          ...No need to shout.
          ...Yeah, somebody might hear you.
          ...I think we seen all there is to see
          round here.

LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet.

                       MUMBLE
             What is it?

There, imbedded in the ice: another six pack holder.

THE SEA ICE

Mumble and the Adelies venture out onto the weak ice beyond
the whaling station, finding more and more of the strange
artefacts: a piece of nylon rope, a soda can, a boot.

                       MUMBLE
             They must be here somewhere.
             They wouldn't leave all this stuff lying
             around.

                       AN ADELIE
             Maybe they invisible.

FURTHER ON

They've reached the edge of the sea-ice. LOVEDAY croaks a
warning. He points out to sea.

                       AN ADELIE
             What is that?

A WAVE has appeared on the glassy surface of the sea. It is
coming towards them, FAST like the bow wave of an IMMENSE
UNDERWATER CREATURE.

                        MUMBLE
             A whale?

                       AN ADELIE
             As long as it's a good whale, not the
             other kind.

The wave is coming CLOSER.

                       ANOTHER ADELIE
             What other kind?!!

A massive BLACK DORSAL FIN breaks the surface.

                       MUMBLE
             The ones with teeth!!

The PENGUINS are off and running...


                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:

The DORSAL FIN keeps coming like the blade of a demonic
carving knife.

Then the monstrous fin disappears and KABOOM! The killer
whale breaches the ice AHEAD of them, cutting off their
retreat.

They are left stranded on a free-floating ICE FLOE

                         THE ADELIES
             ...Jump!
             ...Swim for it!

                       MUMBLE
             No!! Stay on the ice pad where its safe

The little floe is wobbling crazily

                         THE ADELIES
             ...You call this safe amigo?
             ...Maybe we should split up.
             ...You split up I'm staying right here.

The KILLER WHALE breaches again, rising like a tower block
out of the ocean.

                       THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             Woooaaaahhh!!

The ICE PAD flips, flinging them into the water like a
handful of peanuts.

IN THE SEA

The PENGUINS head for shore , swimming for their lives.
LOVEDAY, thrashing and wheezing, is unable to keep up.

                       MUMBLE
                 (stops)
             LOVEDAY! LOVEDAY!!

He swims back. The KILLER WHALE is about to take them both in
one bite. MUMBLE pulls LOVEDAY aside, but he's not quite
quick enough: one of the Whale's outer teeth catches LOVEDAY
by the SIX-PACK PLASTIC and he is DRAGGED AWAY, tethered to
the KILLER WHALE like Captain Ahab.

The WHALE thrashes around wildly trying to dislodge the
hapless little penguin until...


                                                       (CONTINUED)
                                                          65.
CONTINUED:

LOVEDAY is FLUNG high, high into the air and...SPLASHES DOWN
some distance away.

The KILLER WHALE is left with the SIX-PACK PLASTIC lodged in
its teeth.

ICE SHELF

MUMBLE and LOVEDAY scramble onto the ice exhausted.

Wondering where the next attack will come from, the AMIGOS
huddle nearby.

Suddenly the ICE SHELF CRACKS OPEN and the KILLER WHALE soars
right over the top of them

It hits the water but does not stop, just keeps going right
on out to sea. The Penguins have no time to reflect on their
good fortune.

Theres an EARTH SHATTERING NOISE behind them . Turning they
see a vast BLACK SHAPE, a hundred feet high, coming at them
through the fog.

The ADELIES flee across the ice. MUMBLE stands transfixed by
the BIG BLACK SHIP towering above him. On the deck he sees
HUMAN FIGURES...

                        MUMBLE
             Aliens?!

The pack-ice is BUCKLING AND EXPLODING ahead of the GREAT
JUGGERNAUT.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Stop! Please!....

From a safe distance the ADELIES stop and look on in
amazement as Mumble stands his ground, shouting up at THE
SHIP as it advances towards him.

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             ...It's very important!

The ICE beneath his feet OPENS UP, Mumble topples into the
gap and The SHIP PASSES OVER HIM, huge propellers churning,
leaving a channel ninety feet wide.

MUMBLE resurfaces.


                                                    (CONTINUED)
                                                           66.
CONTINUED:

                           MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             WE...HAVE...TO...TALK!

He chases after the ship. THE ADELIES chase after Mumble...

                         THE ADELIES
             ...AMIGO-O-O-O! ...LET IT GO-O-O-O-O!!

Already the ship is half a mile away.

THE ICEBERG

Beyond the last of the ice floes is THE WORLD'S TALLEST
ICEBERG. MUMBLE hurls himself onto it and starts scrambling
up its precipitous sides. THE ADELIES follow, struggling to
keep up.

THE SUMMIT

MUMBLE's POV: THE BIG BLACK SHIP has joined TWO OTHERS about
a mile away. The Adelies join him.

                         THE ADELIES
             ...You found them, you found Aliens!
             ...Now we go back tell everybody who's
             taking the fish.


Mumble's     eyes remain fixed on the horizon.


                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...Don't feel bad Tall Guy.
             ...They were just too fast. Too big.
             ...Too everything.

                       MUMBLE
             They've stopped!

                        LOVEDAY
             Mumble. I owe you my life amigo. And I
             say this because I
             admire and deeply respect you. If you are
             thinking what I think
             you are thinking. You are out of your
             crazy head

                       MUMBLE
             Say Hi to Ella for me

             You say Hi. Come back and say Hi to her
             yourself

Mumble turns, takes a few paces back.

                       MUMBLE
             Oh. One other thing. You guys

                       ADELIES
             What?


Suddenly, MUMBLE turns to the precipice and runs as fast as
he can...

                       MUMBLE
             Excelsi yah!!!

As he launches himself into space...

WIDE SHOT

The tiny penguin soaring off the top of the ICEBERG.

THE ADELIES rush to the edge as, far below Mumble HITS THE
WATER. And vanishes.

                       THE ADELIES
             ...can you believe that
             ...brought us all this way and killed
             himself
             ...no he didn't! look!

Far out he has surfaced and is swimming strongly in direction
of the BIG BLACK SHIP.

                         THE ADELIES (CONT'D)
             ...A dive like that, and still he lives!
             ... Yeah like when he did his Happy Feet,
             his feet had wings.
             ...A normal penguin could never have done
             it.

                       LOVEDAY
             You don't think we should go with him

Loveday follows behind

             Maybe just call me Pedro

THE OPEN SEA

MUMBLE PLOUGHS THROUGH a rolling sea: towering waves block
everything from view but on the crests he catches sight of...

THREE BLACK SHIPS, far ahead, but stationary, as if waiting
for him.

LATER

He's getting closer. The ships are only half a mile away when
Something rises from the deep, threatening to engulf him: a
HUGE NET, TEEMING WITH FISH.

Mumble shoots out of the way, just avoiding being caught as.

UP AHEAD The great NET FULL OF FISH breaks the surface of the
water and is winched on board.

                       MUMBLE
                 (yells)
             HEY! YOU CAN'T DO THAT!
             WHAT ABOUT US?!
             THE SCARCITY! THE SCARCITY!!

As if in response the ship's ENGINES START UP again and the
sea around him erupts in churning foam.

Swamped by the wake, Mumble goes under. When he resurfaces,
THE SHIP is already on its way.

             HEY YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA GET AWAY WITH
             THIS?!! NOT IF I CAN HELP IT YOU SHIT-
             SQUIRTER ALIEN CREEPS.

He takes a deep breath and resumes his pursuit.

OPEN OCEAN

The SEAS are MOUNTAINOUS. There is no sign of the ship now,
nor of land.

MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest
and down into the deep dark valley below.

LATER

The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the
water.

UNDERWATER

Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns
with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!!

A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a
few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening.

                         MUMBLE
             Too loud.

He surfaces, spluttering.

                         MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Too loud!

A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An
ALBATROSS hovers overhead.

                       ALBATROSS
             He's looking for a mate, mate. And these
             days, I tell you they're few and far
             between

From the ALBATROSS' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to
the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale.

             Talking of which, I never seen a penguin

             Convergence mate.

                       MUMBLE
             The Convergence?

                       ALBATROSS
             Where the cold water meets the warm,
             mate. Once you cross it, there's no
             getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove
             anyway?

                       MUMBLE
             I'm trying to talk to the Aliens!

                        ALBATROSS
             The who?

                       MUMBLE
             On the black iceberg. The ones taking all
             the fish!

                       ALBATROSS
             Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate.
             Them aliens is the ones who took out the
             whales.

                       MUMBLE
             They kill whales! That's impossible

                       ALBATROSS
             Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever
             lived. Decimated, mate.

                        MUMBLE
             So if I wanted to talk to them, where
             would I go

                       ALBATROSS
             Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea,
             under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them
             fly. The great southland's swarming with
             em

                       MUMBLE
             Where's that. Do you think the Whale
             would take me there?


                                                        (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: (2)

The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which
the Albatross does not need to translate.

                    ALBATROSS
          No way mate, he won't go anywhere near
          `em. And neither should you.

Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the
warnings.

He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards
the convergence.

The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches.

                    ALBATROSS (CONT'D)
          Don't say I didn't warn you

The ALBATROSS wheels away.

As MUMBLE fights on through the huge choppy waves, the
Whale's Wagnerian song booms out, EERIE and FORLORN.

THE CONVERGENCE

We see from above, the BLUE WHALE turning as well, changing
course to avoid a change in the texture and colour of the
water stretching in a line, as far as the eye can see. MUMBLE
swims RIGHT ACROSS THE LINE.

A VAST OCEAN

MUMBLE is a mere DOT now as the GREAT CURRENTS capture him
and sweep him away.

We pull back through the clouds until the very CURVATURE OF
THE EARTH is visible: a blue horizon with no land in sight.

SMALL POLLUTED BEACH

On the HIGH-WATER MARK, amongst the rubbish and the oil
slick, we see what looks like a dead animal. It is MUMBLE.

A creature in RED GUMBOOTS approaches. Its small hand reaches
down and nudges him with a stick. MUMBLE moans and the
gumboots RUN AWAY, shouting something unintelligible.

With great difficulty, Mumble raises his head to try to see
more. Sunlight flares, bleaching to white, as he LOSES
CONSCIOUSNESS.
                                                            72.


A WHITE ROOM

Scientific books and specimens of birds in large bottles on
shelves line the walls.

MUMBLE, eyes closed, is lying on a stainless steel table. He
opens his eyes to the brilliant glare of an examination lamp.

There is movement around him. Voices whispering in an alien
tongue. A FIGURE IN WHITE bends over him cleaning the oil
from his feathers with detergent. MUMBLE squawks.

                    MUMBLE (VO)
          When I finally saw one, the Alien was
          even more hideous than I'd imagined

A very pretty FEMALE SCIENTIST is smiling down at him.

                      MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D)
          ... frontways eyes, no feathers. Big teeth
          with blood around them. Strange fleshy
          beak. A meat eater

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
              (terrified)
          The - fish - are - ours. Understand?

But all the SCIENTIST sees is a squawking penguin.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          We can't live without them!

The SCIENTIST produces a syringe and squirts some of it's
contents in the air.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Speak Adelie? Skua-talk?

Another SCIENTIST holds him still while the needle is
administered.

                    MUMBLE (CONT'D)
          Oh no! Not the pointy thing!

Drowsy now, he is eased into a PADDED CAGE. The SCIENTISTS
close the lid, and secure it with straps.

IN THE CARGO HOLD

We hear a feeble thumping from inside.

                                                       (CONTINUED)

Pull back to reveal Mumble's box on a shelf among crates and
luggage. Fade in engine noise over as....

ENDLESS SKY

A 747 drones across the screen, eastwards into the night.

DARKNESS

                       MUMBLE
             I woke in darkness. Unable to move. Was I
             dead? And if I was dead, where was that
             light coming from

Like the light at the end of a tunnel. As if in a dream,
MUMBLE ambles towards it. Emerging into

PENGUIN HEAVEN

Bright BLUE SKY, sparkling WHITE CLIFFS OF ICE.

                       MUMBLE
             Wow. They brought me home

His voice ECHOES back at him, with a mocking edge. There is
something unusual about this place. A plump penguin waddles
by

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Excuse me, where are we.

                       PENGUIN
             Heaven. Where d'you think?

                       MUMBLE
             Oh. So we're dead. Right

                       PENGUIN
             Dunno. Don't care. We got food. We got
             water. You hear a seal now and then, but
             you never meet one. Perfect.

Mumble is looking around, trying to figure it out

                       PENGUIN (CONT'D)
             Fish!

                       MUMBLE
             Where?

CONTINUED:

A fish hits him on the head.

A moment later he's knocked flat by a sudden rush of
PENGUINS: Chinstraps, Rock-hoppers, Adelies, King penguins,
emerging from holes in the rock face

                       PENGUINS
             Fish time. Fish time!

Lying on his back he sees fish tumble from the sky. It's
RAINING FISH!

                       MUMBLE (VO)
             Every day after that, it rained fish in
             the afternoon.

His POV, Load after load of fish tumbling out of a clear sky

UNDERWATER

Fish hit the surface and sink

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Fish on land and fish underwater.

Mumble pursues one of them.

                       MUMBLE
             Sometime you got a live one but there was
             nowhere really to chase it

He swims SLAP BANG into a sheet of thick glass. ALIEN FACES
are pressed against it. Mumble yells and shoots to the
surface.

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

High up he sees the viewing gallery. A great CROWD of ALIENS
staring and chattering

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Aliens everywhere, watching you eat,
             watching you sleep

Mumble backs away and knocks into the PAINTED HORIZON. He
puts out a wing to steady himself and notices a metal tag on
it. This place is beginning to upset him.

                       MUMBLE
                 (yells at the aliens)
             What have you done to my wing! This is
             not my home! I want to get out of here!

The other penguins stand around, immobile, chomping fish.

                       OLD TIMER PENGUIN
             Guess he's new here

THE PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Caption: A year later

Specators POV: Mumble stands around, like the others,
ignoring the aliens, chomping fish

His POV: Day after day, the view constantly the same, except
for the groupings of spectators high in the viewing Gallery

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             After a while, you learn to stop fighting
             it. Stop protesting, take the knocks.

CU Mumble: A camera flashes. A fish hits him, he doesn't
flinch

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             ...just take what comes and live inside
             your mind

THE SAME/ PASSAGE OF TIME

Another day and another. Night follows day follows night.
Spectators come and go. The penguins stand like statues.

Though bubbles begin to appear above Mumbles head, snapshots
of his past experiences

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             Sometimes I thought about dad and mum.
             Sometimes the Amigos, and others I'd met
             along the way. But mostly I thought about
             Ella, wondering who she ended up with.
             Whether she had enough food to eat.
             whether she still remembered our song.

In the though bubble, Ella has appeared singing never can say
goodbye. Mumbles feet begin shuffling to the rythm
                                                        76.


SPECTATORS GALLERY

Most of the specators are leaving but one young girls stops
and stares

                     YOUNG GIRL
           Look Mommy! It's dancing!

She bangs on the glass in her excitement.

PENGUIN ENCLOSURE

Mumble, woken from his reverie, looks up and sees her looking
at him.

                     MUMBLE
           What? What did I do?

The little girl who is pointing at mumbles feet. Mumble looks
down, realizes what his feet are doing, looks up again.

                     MUMBLE (CONT'D)
           You like that? Well how about this.

He does a more elaborate step. The Mother shouts in
disbelief. Various other specators come back and join her.

Mumbles fellow captives are unimpressed.

                     PENGUIN #1
           Oh-Oh, another one gone troppo

                     PENGUIN #2
           You think its infectious

                     PENGUIN #3
           I sure hope not

They shuffle away

IN THE SPECTATORS GALLERY.

The aliens, in contrast, are loving it. Already a crowd has
gathered, laughing and clapping.

NEXT DAY

The Gallery is packed. Mumble keeps dancing
                                                           77.


NEXT DAY

Theres a riot going on up there. People fighting to get a
view. Newspaper reporters, TV cameras.

The other penguins in the enclosure have moved back, giving
Mumble more space. Every specattor is focussed on him. Mumble
is focussed on the spectators.

                     MUMBLE (VO
           Yes. Yes. At last something was
           happening. I was finally getting through
           to them!

THE TRANSPORTER BOX

A squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on
him. Kerchunk.

THE EMPEROR COLONY

Silence, then across the vast expanse a TINY FIGURE appears
on the horizon.

                       PENGUIN V/O'S
           ...What's that?
           ...Where?
           ...Coming from the Inland!

A couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure.

                       PENGUINS
           ...Is it a Penguin?
           ...Is it one of ours?

LATER

Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much
diminished: only small groups scattered here and there.

                     MUMBLE
           Hi, where is everybody!?

                     PENGUINS
           Who wants to know?

                      MUMBLE
           I used to live here. When's the Great
           Gathering?


                                                      (CONTINUED)
                                                               78.
CONTINUED:

                       PENGUINS
             This is it. I guess

                       MUMBLE
             This is all that's left?

Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger.

                         PENGUINS
             ... So Who's this?
             ...Kinda small for an emperor.
             ...(suspicious) Where did you say you were
             from?

Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd.

                       ELLA
             Mumble?! Its Mumble!!

                       MUMBLE
             Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a
             bit.

As he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY
CHICKS following behind her

                       MUMBLE (CONT'D)
             Are these all yours?

                       ELLA
             They're my singing students.

                       MUMBLE
             So. You never....

                       ELLA
             Of course not. I was waiting for you.

                       MUMBLE
             But that's fantastic. I've got so much to
             tell you - to tell everyone.
                 (To the gathering crowd)
             I found out who's been causing the
             Scarcity!

                       ELLA
             Huh?

                    MUMBLE
          I know who's been taking our fish!
          I made contact with Aliens!
          They're coming here. Right behind me.
          Listen.

They listen. Above the wind   faint electronic BEEPING SOUND.

                    PENGUINS
          ...Who's doing all the shouting
          ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before.

                    MUMBLE
          No, honestly Aliens will be here soon!
          You have to believe me. We came in a big
          hollow bird and they landed on the ice
          and....

CARUSO bursts through the crowd.

                    CARUSO.
          You again! And still full of the same old
          nonsense.

                    MUMBLE
          But its true!!

The BEEP is quite audible now - a little faster and louder.
Curious, Ella ambles round behind mumble tro see what's
making the noise

                    CARUSO.
          Move along everyone. Pay no attention.
          There's no such thing as aliens

                    ELLA
          So who fixed him up with this.

She turns him around to reveal some kind of circuit board
glued to his back: a small aerial, winking red lights. A
TRANSMITTER.

A gasp of fear and astonishment from the penguins. Caruso is
momentarily speechless.

                    PENGUINS
          ...Does it hurt?
          ....Its not made of feathers thats for
          sure
          ...what's it gonna do

                                                     (CONTINUED)

                    MUMBLE
          It's so they can find me.
              (cocks an ear)
          That's them now. Listen.

A distant rumbling, like some monstrous cataclysm is
approaching

                    CARUSO
          You led them here. Are you crazy!!

                    MUMBLE
          You said they didn't exist.

                    CARUSO
          They'll slaughter us. Head for the sea!

                    MUMBLE
          No. Do this. Do Happy feet.

He starts tap dancing. The penguins are torn, between
Caruso's instructions and Mumbles.

                    MUMBLES
          Its what they understand. They can't
          talk, they can't sing. They speak with
          their feet. Do it.

A few adventurous souls begin to copy him, out of fear if
nothing else.

As they do so, the sky begins to darken. A strange whirling
wind starts whipping the snow around them. The very earth
seems to be shaking under them.

                    CARUSO.
          Now look what you've done!

                    PENGUINS
          ...its the end of the world.
          ....Its all Mumbles fault. I told you

Wishful rounds on them angrily.

                    WISHFUL
          Just do what the kid says.

They start dancing.

Caruso has climbed a small hillock and is ranting like an old
testament prophet

          "Together we stand".
          "Divided We Freeze".

Mumble and Ella are dancing through the community

The tide is beginning to turn in his favour

          That's it! Excellent! ¡Riba Riba,
          penguinos!
          Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!!

                     CARUSO.
          Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will
          protect us

As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous
gust of wind

Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook
helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing
the air.

It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little
distance away.

Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody.

HUMAN scientists disembark. Skidoos are kicked into life.

We TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony

Scientists POV: As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in
astonishment. One of them lifts a video cam to record

THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED
JOY.

                     MUMBLE (VO)
          From that day on, No one quite knows how
          it happened, but the black icebergs began
          to disappear and the fish became abundant
          once more.

A CONFERENCE ROOM

Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as
IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen.

Without the music it's less obviously a dance.

                    CHAIRMAN
          ...So what do you reckon?

                       EXPERT
             Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the
             screen) some kind of neurological
             disorder? a nutritional deficiency
             perhaps. We'd certainly back the
             long-term study.

                       CHAIRMAN
             And the international treaty?

                       DELEGATE#1
             Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need
             for an embargo. No fishing
             whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned,
             whatever.

                       DELEGATE#2
             So we all step up policing of the pirate
             factory ships. And we pressure that
             country to stop their so-called
             `experimental' fishing.

                       DELEGATE#3
             Yes, if our government asks your
             government to approach their government
             to call off their fleet...

                       DELEGATE#2
             Better if their government hear it from
             our government via your government...

                       CHAIRMAN
             What the heck. The amount of publicity
             this is generating, they'd have world war
             three if they didn't stop.

THE COLONY

In the confusion of penguins we find MUMBLE, ELLA and their

             Ella's gave up teaching to look after our
             chick. We take turns looking after her
             and going to get the fish.

As we watch, Ella moves off, joining the great to and fro of
penguins along the highway to the sea.

away.

                       MUMBLE (V.O.)
             I worry about her, sure. Theres so much
             big stuff out there it can be kind of
             frightening.

We are pulling back now, back from the colony, back from
Antarctica.

                       MUMBLE (V.O)
             But the way I see it. Theres so much out
             there we don't understand...,

SPACE

Still pulling back


             ....the stuff you think is small stuff
             could actually be the big stuff.

Keep pulling back from the world, the solar system,       the
galaxy.

                       MUMBLE (V.0
             Or am I not making sense here?

Further back. Our galaxy is framed in something like a bomb-
sight.


                       VOICE#1
             Is there a problem? I thought this one
             was barren.

IN THE DOME

We`re somewhere otherworldly, inside a clear dome the size of
a stadium, with a view of the heavens. In the centre of this
space, always just out of shot, two illdefined figures are
talking, subtitled:

                       VOICE#2
             More or less. But one of the stars we're
             harvesting supports these things here.

Projected somehow in mid-air A 3-D image of Times square in
winter with tiny people milling around in black coats

                         VOICE#1
             So...?

                       VOICE#2
             Well. Exactly. But what we didn't know
             about before was these things here

An image of the dancing penguins appears.

                       VOICE#2 (CONT'D)
             Just thought you'd want to see them
             before...you know.

The shadowy figure laughs, enjoying the image.

                        VOICE#1
             Hmm.   Charming

                         VOICE#2
             So.    We go ahead. Or...?

                       VOICE#1
             No. Better leave them be. See what
             sector twelves got to offer instead.

The bomb sight moves away from our galaxy to another part of
the universe

With that the two figures head off across the great shadowy
interior.

The projector beam catches them, briefly, throwing up the
giant shadows of these aliens They look very like huge
penguins.

As they walking solemnly out of shot with their hands behind
their backs one of them breaks step to do a little jig.

          1   INT. BILLY OFFICE (BREWSTER KEEGAN INVESTMENT BANK)- 4:50 PM

                                                                         1
              BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting
              at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex-
              girlfriend.

                                  MAN (O.S.)
                     Billy Boy!
              J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters
              the office.

                                  J.D.
                     Get your ass ready! It's almost five
                     o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his
                     drink on!
              J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo.

                                  J.D.
                     Oh God. Give me that.     I'm burning it
                     once and for all.
              J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as
              the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back.

                                  BILLY
                     Don't!

                                  J.D.
                     Dude, it's been six months.    You have to
                     move on.
              BILLY nods knowingly.

                                  J.D.
                     You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot
                     chick riding your jock all night long.

                                  BILLY
                     You're such a romantic, J.D.

                                  J.D.
                     It would help get your mind off of Sarah.
              BILLY ponders this for a moment.

                                  BILLY
                     Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other
                     women, I wouldn't even know what to do.
                     I've been out of the game so long.

                                  J.D.
                     Billy, you come out with me tonight, and
                     I promise you'll get laid.

                                  BILLY
                     Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson
                     needs me to update the financial models
                     for his meeting with the foreign
                     investors.

                                  J.D.
                     So what? It's Friday!      You have all
                     weekend to do that.

                                  BILLY
                     No I don't. The Germans are taking an
                     earlier flight back, so the meeting's
                     been moved to tomorrow.
              J.D. thinks for a moment.

                                  J.D.
                     Well, why don't you just get somebody
                     else to do your work then?

                                  BILLY
                     Who?
              J.D. gets a big smile on his face.    He has an idea.

          2   INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - 4:55 PM                                 2
              HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American
              workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up
              his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day.
              BILLY and J.D. approach...

                                  BILLY
                     Harold, listen, I need you to update
                     these models for me.

                                  HAROLD
                            (confused)
                     But aren't you supposed to...

                                  BILLY
                     I know, but something came up. I have to
                     meet with some clients tonight, so I
                     won't be able to get to it. It's your
                     responsibility now. Okay?
              Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to
              protest, J.D. steps forward...

                                  J.D.
                     And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine
                     o'clock sharp.

                     With all the downsizing going on around
                     here, we wouldn't want to have to tell
                     Berenson that you've been slacking. He's
                     just dying to figure out who he should
                     fire next.

                                  HAROLD
                     Uh...okay...no problem...
              BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk.

          3   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM                    3
              BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot.

                                   BILLY
                     Wow!   I can't believe how easy that was!

                                  J.D.
                     Dude, how do you think I get all my shit
                     done? I'm telling you -- those Asian
                     guys love crunching numbers. You
                     probably just made his weekend.
              The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE.

          4   INT. J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE                                       4
              Billy and J.D. enter the car.

                                  J.D.
                     Now get ready. It's time we embark
                     on...Operation Get Some!
              And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes
              the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy
              song kicks in.
              Intercut:

          5   INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE                                    5
              Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through
              the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick
              in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it.
              When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats
              in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner.
              J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his
              car zooms out of the parking lot.

          
              QUICK BOOM UP from J.D.'s Convertible and PUSH IN to Harold
              standing at a window watching as Billy and J.D. zoom off.
              He looks at the stack of papers they gave him...

              KUMAR PATEL (22, Indian, Funky Hair) is answering questions
              from his NYU Medical School interviewer, DR. Woodruff (middle
              aged, erudite, very professional). Kumar has NO ACCENT.
              He's American.

                                  KUMAR
                     Mononucleosis or mono is an infection
                     caused by the Epstein-Barr virus.
                     Symptoms may include fever, sore throat,
                     headaches, white patches on the back of
                     your throat, swollen glands, sluggishness
                     and loss of appetite.

                                  DR. WOODRUFF
                     Excellent, Kumar. I have to say you're
                     one of the best applicants I've ever
                     interviewed. Not that it's a surprise.
                     Your father is very respected in his
                     field. You know he and I had some pretty
                     wild times when we were in med school.

                                    KUMAR
                     Really?

                                  DR. WOODRUFF
                     Yeah. We started our own basketball team--
                     the Hemoglobin Trotters...
                            (cracking up)
                     Yeah, we were crazy.
              Kumar nods and smiles.   Woodruff finally stops laughing...

                                  DR. WOODRUFF
                     Anyway-- just one more question.
                            (reading from a clipboard)
                     What are some potential symptoms of
                     pancreatitis?

                                  KUMAR
                     Let's see. There might be epigastric
                     tenderness, diffuse abdominal
                     tenderness...
              Suddenly, we hear what sounds like be a match being lit, a
              gurgle, and a cough -- the distinct sounds of somebody
              smoking from a bong. Dr. Woodruff is confused. Kumar pulls
              out his cell phone. It's his personalized ringer.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Dr. Woodruff)
                 I'm sorry. Can you hold on one second?
          Kumar stands up and answers his cell phone.

                              KUMAR
                        (into the phone)
                 Kumar's phone. Kumar speaking.
                        (listening)
                 Oh, hey.
                        (listening)
                 Nothing important. I can talk. What's up?
          Dr. Woodruff is offended. He takes a sip of from a mug of
          coffee and watches as Kumar begins pacing around the office.
          Intercut:

                 I'm not gonna be able to partake in our
                 usual Friday night ritual. I've gotta
                 stay late at the office.

                              KUMAR
                        (into the phone)
                 Fuck that shit! We had plans!
          Dr. Woodruff can't believe Kumar's choice of words.

                              HAROLD
                 I know, but I gotta get this work done.

                 prevented you from finishing your work?
          Dr. Woodruff is so shocked that the mug of coffee simply
          slips out of his hands. Hot coffee goes all over his shirt.
          Woodruff yells and starts wiping his shirt with a napkin.

                              HAROLD (O.S.)
                 Listen, I'd love to go home, but...

                              KUMAR
                 No fucking buts! I just bought a quarter
                 of the finest herb in New York City, and
                 I'm not smoking it alone.

                              KUMAR (cont'd)
                 So you're just gonna have to chill the
                 fuck out, bring your work home, and
                 prepare to get blazed, because in a
                 couple of hours I expect both of us to be
                 blitzed out of our skulls. Got it?...Okay
                 good. See you later.
          Kumar hangs up the phone and sits back down.      Dr. Woodruff is
          stunned.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Dr. Woodruff)
                 Okay, where was I? Oh yes. More
                 symptoms of pancreatitis. Um...decreased
                 bowel sounds, possibly fever,
                 dehydration, and sometimes even shock.

                              DR. WOODRUFF
                        (livid)
                 Mr. Patel. This is supposed to be a
                 proper interview. Do you actually believe
                 after the way you've behaved that I would
                 ever even consider recommending you for
                 admission?

                                KUMAR
                 No.    I'd actually be pretty surprised.
          Dr. Woodruff is flustered.   He doesn't know how to react.

                              KUMAR
                 Look, I'm just interviewing so my dad
                 will keep paying for my apartment. I'm
                 not really planning on going to med
                 school.

                              DR. WOODRUFF
                        (confused)
                 But...you have perfect MCAT scores!

                              KUMAR
                 Well, I'm not an idiot.
          Dr. Woodruff is at a loss for words.
          Kumar notices a framed picture of a HOT TEENAGE GIRL on Dr.
          Woodruff's desk. He picks it up.

                                KUMAR
                 Wow!    Is this your daughter?
          A disturbed Dr. Woodruff grabs the portrait out of Kumar's
          hands.

               Harold shuts down his laptop. He then puts the laptop along
               with all his paperwork into a bag and leaves the office.

          9    EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT                                9
               Harold walks to the end of the parking lot, where his car is
               parked. As he walks, the strap of his laptop bag breaks and
               falls to the ground. Harold is frustrated as he picks it up.

          10   EXT. PARKING LOT EXIT GATE                                  10
               After other cars zoom through uninterrupted, the ELDERLY
               PARKING ATTENDANT stops Harold and checks his ID before
               letting him leave.

          11   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING PARKING LOT - 6:21 PM               11
               Harold's driving his WHITE INFINITI G20. He finds a spot...

                                    HAROLD
                      Yes!   Right in front...
               Harold carefully lines up his car to parallel park. As he
               starts to pull in, A YELLOW JEEP STEALS THE SPOT FROM BEHIND.
               The jeep is loaded with "alternative" stickers, and has a
               KAYAK, HANG-GLIDER, and other sports equipment on the roof.
               Harold almost hits the JEEP. He knows this car.

                                   HAROLD
                             (frustrated, to himself)
                      Those assholes.
               The driver, COLE (20's, asshole, high energy, intense, loud
               mouth), puts down his window...
               COLE is joined in the jeep with his EXTREME SPORTS PUNK
               FRIENDS, who all laugh at Harold.

                                   COLE
                             (mock Asian accent)
                      This is America, dude! Learn how to

               Frustrated, Harold turns around and continues driving...

                He ends up parking far from the building. He has to parallel
                park. He's anal with his parking, going in and out a bunch
                of times, until the car is positioned perfectly in the spot.

          11B   EXT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT BUILDING                  11B
                Harold walks a bunch of blocks to his apartment building. He
                walks up the steps to the LOBBY ENTRANCE of his building...
                Suddenly, he stops in his tracks. Through the glass door, he
                sees... MARIA-- A beautiful, sweet-looking young woman of
                Puerto-Rican descent. She's standing by the elevators.
                HAROLD can't move. He's mesmerized. This is his dream girl.
                Harold takes a deep breath...

                                    HAROLD
                       Okay, be yourself. Don't be nervous.

          11C   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING (LOBBY) - DAY                       11C
                Harold enters the building and walks over to Maria. They
                give each other a friendly smile. We hear a "BING" sound,
                indicating the elevator has arrived. The doors open and
                Harold and Maria walk inside.

          12    INT. ELEVATOR                                                12
                HAROLD and MARIA are standing silently as the elevator goes
                up. Eventually, Harold gets the courage to speak...

                                    HAROLD
                       So Maria, what's been going on?

                                    MARIA
                       Oh, nothing. It's just been a long week.
                       How about you?

                                    HAROLD
                       My week was great. Work wasn't too bad. I
                       caught up on some sleep. Plus, the guy
                       who works next to me decided to bathe for
                       a change.

                                      MARIA
                       Really?

                                    HAROLD
                              (deadpan)
                       Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
                       that. Work sucked. I barely slept. And
                       the guy next to me still smells like
                       crap. But a man can dream, right?

          

                               DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   9.

          

          
               Maria laughs.   Harold's pleased that his joke worked.

                                   HAROLD
                      So what are you up to tonight?

                                   MARIA
                      Actually, I'm probably gonna work out a
                      little bit, clean up the apartment, and
                      then go over to my boyfriend's place.
                      He's cooking me a really nice dinner.

                                   HAROLD
                             (disappointed)
                      Really?

                                    MARIA
                             (smiling)
                      Oh wait, I meant the exact opposite of
                      that.
                             (beat)
                      I'll actually probably just sit on my
                      ass, eat a pint of Hagaan Daz, and watch
                      Blind Date.

                                   HAROLD
                             (playful)
                      That sounds awful.
               Harold laughs, as does Maria.    They smile at each other...

                                   HAROLD
                      Well, if you want some company, maybe you
                      could sit on your ass at my place.

                                     MARIA
                               (flirty)
                      Maybe.

          
               We hear the "BING" of the elevator...

          13   INT. APARTMENT BUILDING(LOBBY)                                 13
               We're back in the lobby. EVERYTHING THAT JUST HAPPENED WAS A
               FANTASY. Harold and Maria enter the elevator.

          14   INT. ELEVATOR                                                  14
               HAROLD and MARIA stand silently while the elevator goes up.
               It's clear Harold wants to say something, but he doesn't have
               the courage. They reach their floor and exit the elevator.

               MARIA walks over to her apartment and goes inside.

                                     HAROLD
                      Bye.

          16   INT. HAROLD AND KUMAR'S APARTMENT - 6:30 PM                  16
               Tired and frustrated, Harold enters his apartment. The place
               is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a
               poster of "BILLY MADISON."

                                     HAROLD
                      Kumar?

                                   KUMAR (O.C.)
                      Yeah, I'm in here!
               Harold walks over to Kumar's room and looks inside. It's
               Martha Stewart's nightmare-- dirty laundry all over the
               floor, etc. On his walls we see old school gangsta rap
               posters. MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA is everywhere. We see a
               Giant Photograph of Kumar with his arm around Mr. T. Kumar
               is not in the room, however.

                                     HAROLD
                      Kumar?

                                     KUMAR (O.C.)
                      In here...
               Curious, Harold walks over to HIS ROOM (neat, tidy, IKEA
               furnishings), where he sees KUMAR STANDING BUTT NAKED IN
               FRONT OF A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR. There's a "clipping sound"
               coming from Kumar's direction. Harold stares at him, shocked
               and appalled. Harold walks inside...

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar, what the hell are you doing!

                                   KUMAR
                      I'm trimming my pubes.
               Kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple
               more snips. On the floor, we see LARGE CLUMPS OF HAIR.

                                   HAROLD
                      Why aren't you doing this in your room!

                                   KUMAR
                      The mirror's in here.
                             (re: his crotch)
                      Hey, check it out! It looks like a Bonsai
                      tree!

                                   HAROLD
                      I'm gonna puke. Get your clothes on.

                                    KUMAR
                       Chill out. It makes my Johnson look
                       bigger. Besides, if I don't do this, I'll
                       end up with pubes like my dad. You've
                       seen Osama Bin Laden's beard, right?
                HAROLD notices something...

                                    HAROLD
                       Are those my scissors? Oh my God!     I
                       trim my nose hair with those!

                                    KUMAR
                       Dude, I've been cutting my ass hair with
                       them for the past six months.

                                    HAROLD

                       GET THE HELL OUT OF MY ROOM!
                Kumar puts the scissors down and EXITS THE ROOM. Harold
                shakes his head and sets up his laptop on his desk...

                Kumar puts on some boxers and a T-shirt (I love Bush: the
                pussy not the president).

                                    KUMAR
                              (calling out to Harold)
                       So what the hell is your problem, anyway?

                                    HAROLD (O.C.)
                       Other than my roommate's boney ass?

          17    INT. HAROLD'S BEDROOM                                        17
                Harold turns on his laptop and is ready to start working.

                                    HAROLD
                              (calling out)
                       One of the senior analysts asked me to do
                       a bunch of his work for him tonight.
                Kumar walks back into Harold's room...

                                    KUMAR
                       I assume you gave him the appropriate "go
                       fuck yourself."

                                    HAROLD
                       If by "go fuck yourself" you mean "no
                       problem sir" then yes, he got the message
                       loud and clear.
                KUMAR shakes his head in disgust...

                                   KUMAR
                      Oh, no wonder you tried cancelling on me
                      today. Dude, you gotta learn how to say
                      "no" once in a while. Now lets get high.

                                    HAROLD
                      No.   I got a lot of work to finish.
               Kumar shuts Harold's laptop.

                                   KUMAR
                      Fuck that! You'll have plenty of time to
                      get that shit done later. Come on, let's
                      smoke a couple joints.
               Harold thinks for a moment and then caves...

                                   HAROLD
                      One joint.

                                   KUMAR
                      One and a half. Now let's do this...
               Kumar exits the room...
               HAROLD hangs his jacket up in his closet, which we see
               organized in rows of suits and button downs.

          18   INT. LIVING ROOM                                           18
               Kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds
               AN M.C.A.T. TEST PREP BOOK. Kumar lifts open the cover--
               inside, we see a hollowed-out circle filled with marijuana.
               Kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy.
               The phone next to the book starts to ring. Kumar doesn't
               care. He lets it ring until the answering machine picks up.

                                   MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT
                             (on the answering machine)
                      Kumar...it is daddy. I hope your
                      interview today was good. I'm calling to
                      remind you that you have another one
                      tomorrow morning with Dr. Wein from
                      Cornell at 10:00 a.m. Do not be late!
               Kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the M.C.A.T.
               book and starts rolling a fat blunt...

                                   MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT
                      It is very important you show up on time!
                      Mommy and I will be very upset if you do
                      not go. Good luck, Kumar. Remember, the
                      meeting is at ten o'clock. Bye bye.

               Harold (still wearing his button-down shirt, only now
               untucked) enters the living room. Kumar is now licking the
               blunt.

                                   HAROLD
                      Don't you think you should take at least
                      one of your interviews seriously? At some
                      point your dad's gonna get really pissed.

                                   KUMAR
                      So what? It's not like there's a
                      shortage of Dr. Patel's out there. My
                      dad's a doctor. My brother's a doctor.
                      Just because everyone in my family went
                      to med school, doesn't mean I have to.

                                   HAROLD
                      Well, then what are you going to do?

                                   KUMAR
                      I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm
                      gonna smoke this fat blunt, get
                      ridiculously high, and then get something
                      to eat.

                                   HAROLD
                      Sounds like a plan.

               HAROLD takes the first hit off the blunt. He nods to Kumar,
               as if to say "that's good shit." Kumar takes the blunt from
               Harold and inhales...

               Harold and Kumar are now smoking out of an ENORMOUS BONG,
               while watching TV. The room is filled with smoke.

               ANGLE - TELEVISION
               It's an episode of "The Router Workshop."

                      I think we've already seen this one.
               Harold changes the channel...

          ANGLE - TELEVISION
          It's an anti-marijuana commercial. Two teenagers are
          listening to rock music in a house without parents. One
          teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired).

                                 BLONDE HAIRED KID
                    Come on, dude. Just take one hit.       Don't
                    you want to be cool?
          Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint. Right
          after he exhales, he walks over to his DAD'S GUN RACK and
          takes out a LONG RIFLE...

                                 BLONDE HAIRED KID
                    Hey man, what are you doing?

                                   BROWN HAIRED KID
                    I'm so high!    Nothing can hurt me!
          The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth.
          We see Blonde Haired kid in slow motion go "Nooooo!" BANG!

          WE HEAR A GUNSHOT AS THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK...

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                    Marijuana kills.

          ANGLE -    HAROLD AND KUMAR
          They're laughing their asses off at the commercial.

                                 KUMAR
                    I love that shit!
          Harold continues flipping channels...

          ANGLE- TV
          We see a News report

                        (mock opening an envelope)
                 ...Harold Lee! Come on down! Take a bow!

                              HAROLD
                 Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie!
                 It's a classic! It's a beautiful story
                 about someone who feels unnoticed,
                 unappreciated, unloved...

                               KUMAR
                 Hey look!   It's you!
          Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN
          CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie]
          Kumar laughs.   Harold isn't amused.
          We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he
          does for the grandparents].

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, when are you gonna start doing some
                 chores around here?
          Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look. He then
          violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar
          laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke...

                              HAROLD
                 We're so high right now.

                              KUMAR
                 We're not low.

                              HAROLD
                 I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as
                 balls.

                                KUMAR
                 No shit!    Let's eat!
          HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that
          have been left on the floor...

                              KUMAR
                 Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight.

                              HAROLD
                 What about KFC?

                               KUMAR
                 Nah, we've been there too many times.
                        (beat)
                 I want something we haven't had in
                 awhile. Something different. Something
                 that'll really hit the spot. I want the
                 perfect food...

                      Are you hungry?
               HAROLD and KUMAR turn their attention to the TV, where they
               see A WHITE CASTLE COMMERCIAL taking place. In the
               commercial, we see DOZENS OF TINY BURGERS lined up in a row.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Then come to White Castle and try our
                      Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and
                      a soft drink for only 2.99.
               HAROLD and KUMAR start salivating, as they see THE STEAM RISE

               FROM THE BURGERS ON THE T.V.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Imagine all those burgers in your stomach
                      right now. Mmmmmh....
               HAROLD and KUMAR move closer to the TV to smell the burgers.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Don't you like food that's tasty and
                      delicious?
               Almost in a trance, HAROLD and KUMAR nod agreeingly.

                                   VOICE ON TV
                      Then what are you waiting for? Head over
                      to White Castle. It's what you crave.
               The commercial ends. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other--
               this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them.

          22   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - 7:45                        22
               HAROLD and KUMAR exit their apartment.

                                   HAROLD
                      You're sure you know how to get there?   I
                      haven't been to White Castle in ages.

                                   KUMAR
                      I'm telling you, there's one right around
                      the corner from that multiplex in New
                      Brunswick.
               They walk down the hallway, stopping at another apartment.
               On the side of the doorway is a MEZUZAH IN THE SHAPE OF A
               NAKED WOMAN. Harold and Kumar walk in without knocking...

          23   INT. ROSENBERG AND GOLDSTEIN'S APARTMENT                     23
               HAROLD and KUMAR walk into an apartment that looks almost
               identical to theirs. (Instead of a "BILLY MADISON" poster,
               there's one of "HAPPY GILMORE.")

          Sitting on the couch is ROSENBERG (a seemingly "nice Jewish
          boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and GOLDSTEIN (a more
          depraved Jewish boy, wearing a t-shirt with a picture of the
          OLSEN TWINS-- underneath the picture we see the words,
          "FINALLY LEGAL ON JUNE 13, 2004"). Both of them are taking
          bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching TV as Harold    
          and Kumar enter...

                              KUMAR
                 Rosenberg, Goldstein-- get up.    We're
                 going to White Castle.
          Rosenberg and Goldstein continue staring at the TV...

                              ROSENBERG
                 Wait-- we're watching The Gift on HBO.

                               KUMAR
                 No waiting.   We're starving...
          Out of the corner of Kumar's eye, he notices Harold grabbing
          a piece of beef jerky from Rosenberg & Goldstein's coffee
          table.

                              KUMAR
                        (scolding Harold)
                 ...Put that down! We're not eating `til
                 we get to White Castle.
          Harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as
          soon, as Kumar turns his attention back to Rosenberg and
          Goldstein, he slips it his pocket.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Rosenberg and
                         Goldstein)
                 Now come on guys, let's go.

                 We're talking about Katie Holmes here.
                 You would never think a sweet, innocent
                 girl like her would ever take her top
                 off. Which is precisely why we have to
                 watch her do it.

               HAROLD presses the "down" button. KUMAR notices that Harold
               has his LAPTOP BAG on his shoulder...

                      You're driving. I'm gonna try to get
                      some of my work done in the car.
               Kumar then checks his pockets and comes up empty.

                                   KUMAR
                      Shit, I forgot my cell phone.

                                   HAROLD

               As Harold and Kumar enter, we hear a DOOR SLAM behind them.
               They turn around and see MARIA locking her door. She hasn't
               noticed Harold and Kumar yet.

                                   KUMAR

                Harold's answer becomes clear as he pushes the "door closed"
                button repeatedly. The door closes before Maria sees them.

                                    KUMAR
                       What the hell are you doing? That was a
                       perfect opportunity! You could have asked
                       her if she wanted to go to White Castle.
                Harold doesn't say anything.   He looks down in shame.

                                    KUMAR
                       You're worthless.

                       Dude, it's only awkward because you're a
                       pussy. Just talk to her once and I

                       It doesn't matter. The only girls
                       interested in me are girls I have no

                       Speaking of Cindy, she called earlier.
                       One of those 58 Asian clubs she's in is
                       throwing a party at her dorm tonight.

                                    HAROLD
                       God, she invites me to everything.

                       So what? She's fucking cute.     Let her

                Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and
                the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS doing lame skateboard tricks on the
                sidewalk near their jeep. They're about to get back in the
                jeep, when Cole sees Harold and Kumar walking near them.

               COLE AND THE PUNKS LAUGH HYSTERICALLY. Harold is
               uncomfortable. Kumar just ignores them.

               for the TOLL BOOTH STOPLIGHT to turn green. It doesn't.

          A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a
          number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A

                 Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of
                 the manned booths and tell them what
                 happened.

          Kumar can't take it anymore. Just as Harold is about to get
          out of the car, Kumar hits the gas and screeches away.

                              HAROLD

                      know we're gonna get shot.

                                   HAROLD
                      Maybe it's not as bad as they say.    It's
                      probably just a bunch of hype.
               They look out the window and see another ASIAN and INDIAN guy
               (Daniel and Shankar) walking down the street. Suddenly,
               THREE HOODS jump out from an alley and start beating the
               living shit out of Daniel and Shankar.
               Kumar gives Harold a dirty look.

                                   HAROLD
                      Let's get the hell out of here.
               KUMAR continues driving. He makes a turn. All of a sudden, he
               stops short, causing he and HAROLD to jerk forward quickly.

                                    HAROLD
                      What the...

               Directly in front of Harold's Infiniti, A BASKETBALL GAME IS

               GOING ON BETWEEN A BUNCH OF HUGE BLACK DUDES, RIGHT IN THE
               MIDDLE OF THE STREET! (There are hoops on both sides.)
               The BASKETBALL PLAYERS briefly look over at Harold's Infiniti
               before continuing their game.

          41   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                      41

                                   HAROLD
                      Dude, we are NOT driving through that
                      basketball game!

                              KUMAR
                 We have to if we want to get out of here.
          Kumar points to a sign indicating that the HIGHWAY is ahead.

                              HAROLD
                 Forget about it. No way.

                              KUMAR
                 Come on. How do you know they're not
                 peaceful Gregory Hines-like black guys?
          With that, the HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN OF ALL TIME ROARS AS
          HE COMPLETES A MONSTER DUNK. In celebration, he violently
          bumps chests with his teammates.

                              HAROLD
                 Turn the car around.

                              KUMAR
                 Why? Are cars not allowed to go through
                 when a game's going on? When we were
                 kids, we used to move to the side when we
                 were playing in the street.
          The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

                              HAROLD
                 For some reason, I don't think this is
                 the same thing.

                              KUMAR
                 I'm going through.
          KUMAR begins inching forward.

                                HAROLD
                 Don't!
          The BASKETBALL PLAYERS slowly begin moving aside.

                                KUMAR
                 Look.    They're moving.   I told you.
          Even though the Players are making way for Harold and Kumar,
          they're still no more than a foot or two from the car at all
          times. Harold is scared shitless. He then notices the
          HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN holding the basketball.

                              HAROLD
                 Shit, he's gonna throw the ball at us.

                              KUMAR
                 How do you know?

                      Look at him!
               The HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN has an ESPECIALLY ANGRY FACE.

                                     KUMAR
                      Oh fuck.
               KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM.

               COUPLE SECONDS, THEY ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND START

               LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY! A RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER TURNS TO

               THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN...

                                   RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER
                      Man, you scared the shit out of them!
                      Make that face again!

                                   HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
                      Okay, okay, okay...
               THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN suppresses his laughter and
               tries to make the face. He bursts out laughing again.

                                    HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
                      Shit.   I can't do it.
               His friends laugh harder.      He tries to regain his composure.

                                    HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN
                      Hold up.   Hold up...
               He manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before
               bursting out laughing again.

                      Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like
                      twenty of those burgers.

                                   KUMAR
                      I'll see your twenty and raise you five
                      orders of fries.

                                   HAROLD

                                   KUMAR
                      Don't worry, we'll find it.
               HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead...

                                   HAROLD
                      There's the multiplex!

                                   KUMAR
                      That means the White Castle should be
                      just around the corner...

               HAROLD AND KUMAR'S MOUTHS DROP! INSTEAD OF WHITE CASTLE,

               THEY SEE A BURGER SHACK. THEY'RE IN TOTAL SHOCK.

                                   HAROLD
                      What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That
                      doesn't look like a White Castle to me!

                                   KUMAR

                 What happened to the White Castle?

                 Excuse me?

                 There used to be a White Castle right in
                 this spot. Where is it?

                        (remembering)
                 Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here.
                 Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad
                 news, but Burger Shack bought this
                 location four years ago.
          HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated.

                              KUMAR
                 Please tell me there's another White
                 Castle in town.

                               BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 Nope.

                              HAROLD
                 Are you sure?

                              BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                 Do I look like the type of guy who would
                 be unsure about something like this?
          HAROLD and KUMAR are freaking out.

                               KUMAR
                 Shit.   What are we gonna do?

                              HAROLD
                 I don't know. Should we just eat here?

                              KUMAR
                 Do you really think that'll satisfy us?
          The BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE senses their desperation.

                 I can make the trip if you're willing to.

                              HAROLD
                 Kumar, I have a shitload of work to
                 finish. And you have that med school
                 interview in the morning.

                              KUMAR
                 Forget about the med school interview.
                 It's a non-issue.

                 If I may interject for a moment...
                        (beat)
                 I've been an employee here for three
                 years now, and if there's one thing I've
                 learned, it's that when you're craving
                 White Castle, the burgers here simply
                 won't cut it.
                        (in his own little world)
                 In fact, just thinking about those tender
                 little White Castle burgers and those
                 grilled onions makes me want to burn this
                 place to the ground and re-build a White
                 Castle in its place.
                        (back to reality)
                 If I were you, I'd suck it up and make
                 the trip.
          KUMAR looks at HAROLD. The guy makes a convincing case.
          HAROLD is clearly torn. We sense that this is an important
          moment for the guys...

                              KUMAR
                        (enticing Harold)
                 You can always do your work in the car.
          HAROLD thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.

                                HAROLD
                 Let's do it.

                              KUMAR
                 Then it's settled. No matter what, we're
                 not ending this night without White
                 Castle in our stomachs. Agreed?
          KUMAR puts his hand out.   HAROLD shakes it.

                                HAROLD
                 Agreed.

                      Wise choice. Besides, you wouldn't want
                      to go near our special sauce tonight.
                      Some of the guys and I added an extra
                      ingredient, if you know what I mean.
               HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.

                      It's semen.

               Infiniti zooms out of the drive thru...

                      White Castle, here we come. I just wish
                      we had some more pot. I'm almost
                      completely sober right now.
               HAROLD ignores this. He's TYPING FEVERISHLY ON HIS LAPTOP--
               trying to get his work done. Meanwhile, Kumar notices a sign
               on for the PRINCETON EXIT.

                                   KUMAR
                      Nice. Princeton. We're getting off here.
               Kumar takes the exit.

                                     HAROLD
                      Why?

                                   KUMAR
                      We're gonna sweet talk Cindy Kim into
                      finding us some weed.

                                     HAROLD
                      Oh no.    I'm not seeing Cindy.

                                   KUMAR
                      Why the fuck not? You talk to her on the
                      phone all the time.

                                   HAROLD
                      She calls me. Then she rambles on about
                      her East Asian Students club or whatever.

                      And I have to pretend like I actually
                      give a shit, or she'll call me a twinkie.

                                    KUMAR
                      A twinkie?

                                   HAROLD
                      You know, yellow on the outside, white on
                      the inside.

                                   KUMAR
                      Look you twinkie bitch, you threw our
                      weed out the window, so now it's your
                      duty to make sure we're high as shit by
                      the time we're eating those burgers.

                                   HAROLD
                      Well, I can't help you out there. Cindy
                      doesn't smoke. She's not gonna help us.

                                   KUMAR
                      As long as she buzzes us into a dorm,
                      we're set. Give me ten minutes in there
                      and I guarantee I'll find some hizzy.

                                   HAROLD
                      No, forget it. I'm not seeing Cindy Kim.

          51   INT. CINDY KIM'S DORM ROOM - 11:OO PM                        51
               HAROLD is sitting on a bed, next to CINDY KIM (very cute,
               prim and proper, Korean girl). Sitting on the floor are A
               DOZEN ASIAN STUDENTS-- pure stereotypes (glasses, nerdy
               clothes, etc). Harold is kind of creeped out by them.

                                   CINDY
                      I'm so glad you showed up, Harold!

                                  HAROLD
                            (unenthusiastic)
                      Yeah. Me too.

                                   CINDY
                      Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued
                      to the envelope I sent you?

                                     HAROLD
                      Uh, yeah.    They were...nice.
               Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises
               his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to
               Cindy. "Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?"
               Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while...

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Kenneth)
                      Uh, yes?

                              KENNETH
                 Kenneth Park. Class of 2004. Is it true
                 you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan?

                              HAROLD
                 Yeah, I'm a junior analyst.

                               KENNETH
                 Awesome!
          KENNETH high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him.
          He then raises his hand again. HAROLD rolls his eyes...

                               HAROLD
                 Yes?

                              KENNETH
                 Uh, this is actually a two-part question.
                 I'm applying for a summer internship at
                 Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a)
                 what it's like being an investment banker
                 and b) if you would write me a
                 recommendation.

                              HAROLD
                 What it's like being an investment
                 banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's
                 pretty...
          HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian
          students. He can't bear to tell them the truth...

                               HAROLD
                 ...awesome?
          All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other.

                              HAROLD
                 As for the recommendation, I may be able
                 to make a call or two...
          CINDY looks at her watch...

                              CINDY
                 Actually Harold, we should be getting to
                 the party. We can discuss all this stuff
                 there. It's just down the hall.
          All the Asian students get up...

                              HAROLD
                 Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait
                 for Kumar...

                                    CINDY
                       You'll see him when we're done. Trust me,
                       you're gonna love this. Kenny's mom
                       dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae.
                Kenneth looks proud of himself.

                                     HAROLD
                       Nice.
                CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away.

          52    INT. DORM HALLWAY - 11:15 PM                                 52
                KUMAR is standing in the hallway, accosting random students.
                He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by...

                                    KUMAR
                       Hey! You know where I can get some
                       chronic?
                The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated...

                                    KUMAR
                       What kind of Ivy League school is this?

          52A   EXT. PRINCETON DORM - 11:16 PM                             52A
                Kumar exits the dorm, and walks throughout the quad, asking
                random students for drugs. Eventually, a HIPPIE-LOOKING
                STUDENT (Phish t-shirt, Birkenstocks) taps KUMAR on the back.

                                    HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                       Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up?
                KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief...

                                    KUMAR
                       Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime
                       of your finest herb.
                The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A
                GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck...

                                    KUMAR
                       Oh my dear sweet lord...
                Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his
                hand away...

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                       Yo, man!   Not cool! This is my baby,
                       man!

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     33.

          

          
          Hippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a
          measly dime bag...

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                 That'll be eighty bucks.

                              KUMAR
                 Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops,
                 bro!
          The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar.

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                 I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel
                 like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy
                 it. That's cool with me. I can find lots
                 of people who want to get high. I can
                 smoke it myself, man.

                              KUMAR
                 Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are
                 you?

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                 One who understands the concept of supply
                 and demand, dude.
          Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a
          couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes
          out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole.

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        (laughing like a prick)
                 Dumbass.
          Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE,
          BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying
          take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making
          their deal.

                              CHRISTY
                 Hey, you guys about to smoke?
          KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS.   They're
          both floored by their hotness.

                             HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                       (to the Twins)
                 Yeah. Wanna come back to my place?

                              KUMAR
                 Please. Like they want to go listen to a
                 bunch of Phish records while you read
                 your lame ass poetry.

                               (to the Twins, showing his
                                bag of weed)
                        Ladies? Wanna get high and have some fun?
                CHRISTY and CLARISSA look at each other. They like this dude.

                           CHRISTY                           CLARISSA
                Sure!                           Sure!

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                               (butting in)
                        Hey, my poetry isn't lame! It's actually
                        quite good.
                The girls clearly aren't convinced. The ignore him and turn
                to Kumar. Hippie Asshole is oblivious to the fact he's not
                part of the crowd.

                                     CHRISTY
                               (re: bag of food)
                        We're just gonna eat before this gets
                        cold. What do you say we meet you back
                        in our room in twenty minutes?

                                     CLARISSA
                        We're in room 109.

                                      KUMAR
                        109.   Got it. I'll see you later.

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        Yeah, see you there.
                THE TWINS walk away. Kumar's excited. Hippie Asshole tries
                to pound fists with Kumar like they're all of a sudden
                friends. Kumar snubs him and runs off.

                                     HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        Not cool, man.

                Kumar runs down the hall and finds HAROLD walking with CINDY
                and the ASIAN STUDENTS. He runs over to them...

                                     KUMAR
                        Rold! Rold! You gotta come quick!
                        There are these two filthy pussies who
                        are just aching to get boned by us.
                KUMAR notices that CINDY is appalled by his choice of words.

                                     KUMAR
                        Uh...I mean...there are two very lovely,
                        young pussies who would like to have a
                        chat with you and I.

                                     CINDY
                      Sorry.    Harold's coming with us.

                                   KUMAR
                      That's bullshit. He's coming with me.
                      Isn't that right, Rold?
               CINDY gives HAROLD an evil eye-- he's intimidated by her.

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Kumar)
                      Let's go to the party for a little while.

                                     KUMAR
                      Fuck that!
               KUMAR notices an open dorm room nearby. He enters the room,
               and returns a few moments later dragging an ASIAN FRESHMAN in
               his pajamas. He pushes the Asian Freshman over to Cindy...

                                   KUMAR
                      Here-- this is Harold's understudy.     You
                      can do whatever you want with him.
                             (to Harold)
                      Let's go.
               KUMAR grabs HAROLD by the arm and drags him away. CINDY
               looks pissed as she watches HAROLD being taken away from her.

               KUMAR takes the first puff of a joint.

                                   KUMAR
                      I can't believe you were gonna ditch me
                      for the Joy Luck Club. You know what
                      their parties are like.

                                   HAROLD
                      Look, what do you want me to say?     I was
                      under pressure.

                                   KUMAR
                      Just say "no"! That's all it takes.      Now
                      take a hit of this.
               Kumar hands Harold the joint...suddenly, a nearby door opens
               and a SECURITY GUARD enters the hall. He sees HAROLD and
               KUMAR with drugs.

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                      Hey, what are you two doing?!
               HAROLD and KUMAR start running down the hallway.

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                      Hey, get back here!
               HAROLD and KUMAR duck around the corner.     They see a door to
               the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.

                                     KUMAR
                      Quick.    In here.
               The guys rush into the WOMEN'S BATHROOM.

          54   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                          54
               HAROLD and KUMAR try to decide where to hide.

                                     HAROLD
                      Shit!    What if he finds us?

                                   KUMAR
                      Dude, chill out. He's not gonna look for
                      us in the women's bathroom.
               Harold and Kumar hear TWO FEMALE VOICES outside the bathroom.

                                     KUMAR
                      Shit!    Get in that stall!
               There's a line of THREE BATHROOM STALLS on one wall. HAROLD
               RUNS INTO STALL NUMBER TWO (the middle one). KUMAR sees the
               BATHROOM DOOR START TO OPEN. He also runs into STALL NUMBER
               TWO and shuts the door behind him.
               The guys struggle to STAND ON THE TOILET BOWL.    Harold's
               laptop bag keeps smacking Kumar.
               CHRISTY and CLARISSA (THE TWINS) enter the bathroom.       They're
               in mid-conversation.

                                   CHRISTY
                      Hurry up, I want to go smoke pot with
                      that cute Indian bloke.

               INTERCUT:
               IN STALL NUMBER TWO, KUMAR'S ears perk up, as we see HAROLD
               and KUMAR both standing on the toilet bowl. From Kumar's POV,
               he sees CHRISTY and CLARISSA through the crack of the door.

                                   CLARISSA
                      It'll be a few minutes, I'm about to have
                      the worst case of the taco shits.
               KUMAR is clearly upset to hear this.

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 Ew...gross.
          CLARISSA runs into STALL NUMBER ONE and shuts the door.
          The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
          look over at that stall.

                               CHRISTY
                 Oh great.   Now I think I have to go.
          CHRISTY enters STALL NUMBER THREE and shuts the door.
          The sound of the door shutting causes HAROLD and KUMAR to
          turn their attention to the other stall. They then look at
          each other grossed out.
          From above, we see HAROLD and KUMAR struggling, while the
          girls have taken their places in the surrounding stalls.

          WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL.

                                CLARISSA
                 Ahhhhh!
          HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified.      There is silence for a few
          seconds until....

                              CHRISTY
                 Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle
                 shits?
          We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?"

                              CLARISSA
                 Oh my God. We haven't played that since
                 back in camp!
          HAROLD and KUMAR look confused.

          WE HEAR A LOUD FARTING NOISE, THEN THE SOUND OF SHIT HITTING

          THE WATER...

                                CHRISTY
                 Wait for it.    Wait for it.    Ahhhhh!

                                CLARISSA
                 Hit!
          HAROLD and Kumar look terrified.

          55   EXT. DORM COMMON ROOM                                        55
               Meanwhile, CINDY has left the other students and is roaming
               the hallways, looking for Harold. She sees Hippie Asshole
               walking by, counting Kumar's money...

                                   CINDY
                      Have you seen a Korean guy around here?

                                   HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                      Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of
                      them in this dorm.
                             (to himself, but audible)
                      `Tard.
               Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid.

          56   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                        56
               We hear the sound of diarrhea splattering against the bowl.

                                    CLARISSA
                      Hit!
               We see HAROLD dry heave.
               We hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again.
               CLARISSA smiles.

                                   CHRISTY
                      You sank my destroyer! Scag!
               KUMAR almost pukes as HE DROPS THE POT INTO THE TOILET BOWL.

                                    HAROLD
                              (whispering)
                      Shit!

               THEY SEE THE MARIJUANA UNPROTECTED FLOATING IN THE TOILET.

               WE THEN HEAR THE MOST DISGUSTING DIARRHEA SOUND YET.

                                   HAROLD

                      I CAN'T TAKE THIS!
               With that, HAROLD runs out of the stall and exits the
               bathroom. The girls look shocked.

                                   CHRISTY
                      Who was that?
               KUMAR looks nervous. He quickly bolts from the bathroom.

                                   CLARISSA
                      Christy, are you still here?

                Silence until...We hear a SUPER LOUD FART.    CHRISTY starts
                laughing.

                                     CLARISSA
                       Damn!   You sank my battle shit!

                Harold and Kumar run down the dorm hallway, grossed out.    As
                they run, they suddenly see--

          57A   INT. COMMON ROOM                                            57A
                Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST
                ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the
                "nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each
                other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP.
                Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the
                dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the
                couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES.

                                    KENNETH
                       Pot brownies for everyone!
                Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at
                them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it.
                Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth...

                                     CUTE ASIAN CHICK #1
                       Hey, K-dog!   Can we have some brownies?

                                    KENNETH
                       To tell you the truth, I'm running low.
                       But a quick titty flash may persuade me.
                The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!"
                They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs.

                                    KUMAR
                       Dude, I'm starting to think you made a
                       mistake by not going to this party...
                Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY
                GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER

                SECURITY GUARD (#2)--

                                     SECURITY GUARD
                       Hey, you!
                The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND

                KUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE

                GUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM...

               Further down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers
               watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a
               quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she
               notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing.
               Cindy Kim notices Harold...

                                     CINDY KIM
                      Harold!
               They keep running, past the bathrooms, where Christy and
               Clarissa exit...

                                     CHRISTY AND CLARISSA
                      Kumar!
               They continue running.
               The guards are still running after Harold and Kumar, who see
               the EXIT DOORS just ahead. Suddenly, the Hippie Asshole
               walks by, blocking their path.

                                   HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                             (to himself)
                      Where the hell is 109, man?
               Harold is about to avoid him, but Kumar grabs Harold close
               and the two of them BASH INTO THE Hippie Asshole-- KNOCKING

               HIM ON HIS ASS.
               Harold and Kumar burst out the doors and EXIT THE DORM...
               The Security Guards run by the Hippie Asshole, but stop when
               they see his backpack, which is half-open, and is exposing
               THE GIANT BAG OF WEED. The Security Guard picks it up...

                                   SECURITY GUARD
                      Well, well, well. What have we here?

                                   HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                             (reaching for the bag)
                      Aw, dude! Don't take it! It's mine!
               He continues to protest as SECURITY GUARD #2 holds him down.

                                   KUMAR
                             (using his fingers)
                      I can't believe it. We were this close
                      to getting high and getting laid.

                                   HAROLD
                      Oh, come on, you always exaggerate.    We
                      weren't gonna get laid.

                                   KUMAR
                      Hey, the diarrhea twins would've had sex
                      with us! And what about Cindy?! She was
                      looking hot tonight! The fact that you're
                      not into her just might make you gay!

                                   HAROLD
                      I know Cindy's cute, it's just...

                                    KUMAR
                      What?   You'd rather have Maria?
               From Harold's reaction, it's clear he hit it on the head.

                                   HAROLD
                      Look, it doesn't matter. I'm gonna end
                      up with Cindy anyway. It's just more
                      practical. Now can we drop this and get
                      our asses to White Castle?

                                    KUMAR
                      Fine.
               Suddenly, KUMAR pulls the car over to the side of the road...

                                   HAROLD
                      Now what are you doing?

                                   KUMAR
                      Daddy needs to urinate.
               Harold rolls his eyes.

               KUMAR gets out of the car (leaving the car door open). He
               walks onto the grass near the road for about fifteen yards
               until HE FINDS A NICE BUSH. HE UNZIPS HIS PANTS AND STARTS

               PEEING ON THE BUSH..

                                    KUMAR

               As he types, A RACCOON JUMPS INTO THE CAR AND CRAWLS INTO THE

               KUMAR is still peeing. Suddenly, A CREEPY GUY (FROM OUT OF
               NOWHERE) walks over to him. The Creepy Guy unzips his pants
               and starts urinating IN THE SAME BUSH, RIGHT NEXT TO KUMAR!
               Kumar looks at the Creepy Guy -- totally confused. The
               Creepy Guy simply goes about his business. It's clear that
               Kumar wants to say something. He remains silent for a couple
               seconds, until he can't take it anymore...

                                   KUMAR
                      Excuse me...I'm sorry, I just have to ask
                      you...why are you peeing here?

                                   CREEPY GUY
                      What do you mean?

                                   KUMAR
                      Why did you decide to piss here right
                      next to me? Why not that bush over there?

                                   CREEPY GUY
                      Well, this looked like a good bush to pee
                      on. Why'd you choose this bush?

                                   KUMAR
                      Nobody was here when I chose this bush.

                                   CREEPY GUY
                             (getting heated)
                      So you can pee here and nobody else can,
                      is that it?

                                   KUMAR
                      I was just saying....

                                   CREEPY GUY
                      Is this like your special bush or
                      something?

                                    KUMAR
                      No, I just...
                             (beat)
                      You know what? Forget about it. I'm not
                      in the mood to get stabbed right now.
               The CREEPY GUY calms down. He and KUMAR silently urinate
               next to each other for about TEN SECONDS, until the Creepy
               Guy subtly looks at Kumar's package.

                                    CREEPY GUY
                      Nice pubes.

                      Thanks.

               KUMAR gets into the car and shuts the door.     He hits the gas
               and continues driving down the dark road...

                                   HAROLD
                      Do you even know where you're going?

                                   KUMAR
                      I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But
                      don't worry. Once we get on the highway,
                      we'll be there soon.

                                      HAROLD
                      We better.                                                     
               It starts to rain...                                                  

                                   HAROLD                                            
                      Shit, now it's raining.                                        

                                   KUMAR                                             
                      What's the big deal?                                           

                                   HAROLD                                            
                      Look, I'm completely on edge right now,                        
                      okay? After all the shit we've been                            
                      through tonight, I don't know how much
                      more of this I can take.

               AT THAT MOMENT, THE RACCOON JUMPS OUT FROM UNDER HAROLD'S

               SEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS

               BITING HIS NECK...

                                      HAROLD

                      AHHHHH!!!     FUCK!!!!
               KUMAR turns and sees the raccoon on Harold.

                                      KUMAR
                      Holy shit!
               HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     KUMAR
               tries to help him.

               We see Harold's Infiniti SWERVING BACK AND FORTH.

               HAROLD FINALLY GETS THE RACCOON OFF OF HIM. He holds it as
               far away from his face as possible. The raccoon's arms and
               legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape.

                                   KUMAR
                      How the hell did that get in here?

                                   HAROLD
                      Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have
                      rabies now or something!

                                 KUMAR
                           (looking at Harold's neck)
                    Don't worry. He didn't even break your
                    skin. You'll be fine.

          SUDDENLY, THE RACCOON COUGHS UP BLOOD ONTO HAROLD'S SHIRT.

                                 HAROLD
                    Oh, that's not good!

          HAROLD TURNS THE RACCOON AWAY FROM HIM.          THE RACCOON COUGHS

          UP BLOOD ONTO KUMAR.

                                 KUMAR
                    Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer
                    raccoon away from me!!!

          KUMAR SWERVES THE CAR IN A PANIC, AS HAROLD OPENS HIS WINDOW.

          KUMAR WATCHES AS HAROLD CHUCKS THE RACCOON OUT THE WINDOW.

                                 KUMAR
                    Thank Christ!
          Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF

          HEADLIGHTS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM!

                        HAROLD                                KUMAR
          Shit!!!                                Shit!!!
          KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD
          and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch
          nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins
          walking over to them.

                                   HAROLD
                    Uh-oh.
          KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside...

                                 GOLDSTEIN
                    What the hell do you think you were
                    doing? You almost killed us!
          GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR.

                                   GOLDSTEIN
                    Holy Shit!

                                   KUMAR
                    Goldstein?
          HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief.

                                 GOLDSTEIN
                           (to his car)

               Rosenberg gets out of the car and walks over.     HAROLD and
               KUMAR get out of their car.

               Kumar is sitting in the waiting room. He hides his head in a
               jittery manner, as if he's hiding from someone. Next to him
               are DANIEL and SHANKAR, who are both badly beaten and nursing
               their wounds. They all make eye contact. It's weird.

          Harold enters the room with a band-aid on his neck...

                              HAROLD
                 I don't have rabies.
          Kumar stands up quickly.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    47.

          

          

                              KUMAR
                 Great, let's get out of here.
          Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT...

                               MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.)
                 Kumar!!!
          Kumar know that voice all too well...

                               KUMAR
                 Shit.

          
          KUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS
          BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five
          years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire.

                              HAROLD
                 Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come
                 to the hospital.
          Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.

                              KUMAR'S FATHER
                        (thick accent)
                 I hope you are here to apologize for what
                 you did in your interview today. Dr.
                 Woodruff is a very good friend of mine,
                 and let's just say he was not at all
                 amused by your antics...and neither am I.

                              SAIKAT
                        (no accent)
                 What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar?
                 Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a
                 beamer. And I get laid whenever I want.
                 You can have all that too, if you'd just
                 get off your ass and go to med school.

                              KUMAR
                 Eat my balls, Saikat.

                              SAIKAT
                 God, you're 22 years old already! When
                 are you gonna grow up and stop with this
                 post-college rebel bullshit? Like your
                 life is so tough.
          Kumar doesn't have a response.   Saikat's right.

                              KUMAR'S FATHER
                 I will not tolerate this business from
                 you any longer. You have one more
                 interview tomorrow and it is the last one
                 I'm setting up for you.

                              KUMAR'S FATHER (cont'd)
                 If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were
                 anything short of spectacular, I'll
                 completely cut you off!

                              KUMAR
                 Oh, come on, dad!

                              KUMAR'S FATHER
                 "Daddy will not be coming on anything!"
                 You will be there and you will behave!
                 I've put too much time and effort into
                 you to let you go and fuck it all up.
          KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place.

                              KUMAR
                 You're right. I'm sorry.
          KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug.

                              KUMAR
                 It won't happen again.

                               KUMAR'S FATHER
                 Good.   I'll speak with you tomorrow.
          KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he
          and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned...

                              HAROLD
                 Wow. So I guess you're going to med
                 school after all, huh?

                              KUMAR
                 Fuck that! Like I care what my dad
                 thinks. I can't wait to see the look on
                 his face when he finds out I skipped the
                 interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me
                 off? Fine! I don't need his money!

                              HAROLD
                        (extremely confused)
                 But...you just hugged him...

                              KUMAR
                 I just needed to get my hands on these...
          KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS.

                              KUMAR
                 Two words-- medical marijuana.
          HAROLD shakes his head in disgust.

                Using the SCAN CARDS, Harold and Kumar walk into a room where
                there are loads of medical supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar
                grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on...

                                    KUMAR
                       Look, I'm telling you, they see   an Indian
                       and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll
                       just assume we're doctors. Then   we walk
                       right into the pharmacy and get   the weed.
                Harold does not appear happy he's doing this.

          75    INT. HALLWAY                                                75
                HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks)
                walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway...

                                    HAROLD
                       If we get caught, you're taking the
                       blame. This wasn't my idea.

                                    KUMAR
                       We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna
                       get toasted and then we're gonna eat
                       delicious White Castle-- just like we
                       planned.
                All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked
                out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy
                feely).

                                    MALE NURSE
                       Dr. Patel, thank God I found you!    I need
                       your help immediately!
                The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room...

          76    INT. EMERGENCY ROOM                                         76
                The scene is very fast paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL
                TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is confused and concerned
                as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient...

                                    HAROLD
                              (whispering to Kumar)
                       What the hell's going on here?

                                    KUMAR
                       He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry.
                       Leave the talking up to me.
                On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST.
                He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   50.

          

          

                              MALE NURSE
                 The patient was brought in by EMS five
                 minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds
                 with entry in the anterior abdomen. No
                 exit wounds.
          HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest.

                               HAROLD
                 Oh shit!   This guy's gonna die!!!

          THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD.

                              MALE NURSE
                 It's a good thing I found you two. All
                 the other surgeons are working on other
                 patients...
          The NURSE hands HAROLD a surgical instrument.

                              HAROLD
                 Wait. Hold on. You see you got this all
                 wrong. We're not doc...
          KUMAR interrupts before HAROLD can tell her the truth.

                              KUMAR
                 What Dr. Lee is trying to say is that we
                 need to sedate the patient first or else
                 he could go into cardiac arrest.
          HAROLD looks at KUMAR confused and nervous.

                              MALE NURSE
                 Alright. I'll get the anesthesiologist.
          The NURSE is about to rush away, but Kumar stops him.

                              KUMAR
                 Hold on. What we should probably use is
                 marijuana. That'll sufficiently sedate
                 the patient for surgery.

                              MALE NURSE
                        (confused)
                 Marijuana? But why...

                              KUMAR
                 We don't have time for questions! We
                 need marijuana now! Get as much of it as
                 possible! Like a big bag of it!
          KUMAR shows the amount he wants with his hands.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   51.

          

          

                              MALE NURSE
                 But doctor, we don't have marijuana in
                 this hospital.
          HAROLD gives KUMAR a dirty look.

                               KUMAR
                         (to himself)
                 Shit.
          Suddenly, more blood squirts from the Patient's chest.
          Harold shouts in disgust, making the Patient more nervous...

                              MALE NURSE
                 We're losing him! You gotta do something!

                              KUMAR
                        (disappointed)
                 Very well. I guess we'll have to do this
                 the old fashioned way.
          KUMAR puts a nitrous oxide mask over the Patient's face.
          Harold gives Kumar a look-- "What the fuck are you doing?"

                              KUMAR (CONT'D)
                 First, we need to clear his C-spine. I
                 want stat x-rays of the chest and
                 abdomen. Give me two large bore IVs and
                 start a ringers lactate push. Nurse, we
                 need 2 units of O neg on board.
          Using the surgical equipment, Kumar actually begins removing
          bullets from the bleeding patient!!! Harold can't believe
          what's going on.
          Suddenly, the Patient begins having trouble breathing! He's
          gasping for air! The BEEPING SOUND monitoring his heart rate
          begins speeding up to an insane pace.

                             MALE NURSE
                 Doctor! The patient is desatting!
          Kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...

                              KUMAR
                 Ah, I see. The Patient's got a collapsed
                 lung. Get me a 14-gage Angiocath, stat!
          After a couple seconds go by...

                              KUMAR
                 What's taking so long?

          

                             DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   52.

          

          
               The NURSE hands KUMAR what is essentially a LARGE NEEDLE!
               Kumar directs the needle in the direction of the Patient's
               chest. It's a tense moment. The Patient is scared. So is
               Harold. The Nurse looks hopeful. Kumar looks determined.
               With a quick thrust, Kumar jabs the needle into the Patient's
               chest, causing a rush of air! The Patient breathes easier.
               His heart rate drops back to normal.

                                   MALE NURSE
                      Great catch doctor! His sat is up to 94!
               Kumar is cool and collected. He turns to the YOUNG MEDICAL
               TECHNICIANS who have been aiding the surgery.

                                   KUMAR
                             (casual)
                      Will one of you guys put the chest tube
                      in and wrap this up?
               A chorus of "yes, doctors."

                                   KUMAR
                             (taking off his gloves)
                      Well, it looks like my work here is done.
               Kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his
               face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous.
               He then leans down to the BLEEDING PATIENT, who is just
               barely conscious -- but seems in good spirits...

                                   KUMAR (CONT'D)
                      Say, you wouldn't happen to know the
                      quickest way to get to the White Castle
                      in Cherry Hill from here, do you?

               Harold is very excited. Kumar is proud of himself, but
               playing it cool.

                                   HAROLD
                      I'm telling you. That was amazing!    Even
                      your dad would've been impressed!

                                   KUMAR
                             (nonchalant)
                      Yeah. It wasn't bad.

                       HAROLD
          This is perfect! We're back on the road.
          We have directions now. The rain let up.                
          And guess what...

          HAROLD clicks on the "SAVE" option on his laptop...

                               HAROLD
                 I'm officially done with my work.
                        (beat)
                 I'm telling you, things are finally
                 starting to go our way.
          While they're stopped at a red light, Kumar takes in his
          surroundings and notices something...

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, check it out!     Your movie's playing.
          Outside, to Kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater
          we see: "JOHN HUGHES RETROSPECTIVE. CURLY SUE - 9:00.

          SIXTEEN CANDLES - 11:00.

                              KUMAR
                 And look who went to see it...
          Harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees MARIA
          standing outside, all by herself. He can't believe it.

                               HAROLD
                 Holy shit.

                              KUMAR
                 You see? You thought you two had nothing
                 in common. But it turns out you both
                 have the same lame taste in movies. Hey,
                 you wanna see if she wants to come with
                 us to White Castle?

                                HAROLD
                 No way.    Forget about it.   Just drive.
          Kumar puts his hands on Harold's shoulders to get his
          undivided attention.

                              KUMAR
                 Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an
                 hour from home. And who do we see, but
                 your dream girl standing outside a
                 theater playing your favorite movie. I
                 mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic
                 comedy, and I was your annoying gay
                 friend, this would be the moment I'd tell
                 you "this is a sign."

                               HAROLD
                 Stop it.

                              KUMAR
                 Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy
                 Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina
                 Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you
                 yourself said things are starting to go
                 our way...

                              HAROLD
                 Let's just go!
          KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN.

                              HAROLD
                 What are you doing?!

                              KUMAR
                        (calling out)
                 Hey Maria!
          MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN

          REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR

          STARTS PEELING OUT...

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, get your hand off the gas!
          Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then,

          THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY...

                              KUMAR
                        (looking up)
                 Oh shit!
          Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING

          DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL.
          KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car
          safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill.
          Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD.

                              HAROLD
                 You asshole! My car's probably all
                 scratched up now!

                              KUMAR
                 Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us
                 off the road!

                              HAROLD
                 I told you I didn't want to speak to her!
                        (composing himself)
                 Whatever. Let's jut get back on the
                 highway.

                                    KUMAR
                      Fine.
               KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!"   Harold and
               Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated.

          79   EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM                               79
               HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby.
               There's not another car in site.

                                   HAROLD
                      Godammit. You know how to change a flat?

                                   KUMAR
                      Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know
                      how to change a tire.
               Harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    It's missing.

                                   HAROLD
                      Where's my spare tire?

                                   KUMAR
                      I don't know.

                                   HAROLD
                      Shit, where the hell is it?
               Kumar suddenly remembers...

                                   KUMAR
                      Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we
                      got baked and started throwing shit off
                      that bridge to see if it would float?

                                   HAROLD
                      What bridge? What the hell are you
                      talking about?

                                   KUMAR
                             (realizing)
                      Oh shit. That's right. I was with
                      Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day.
                      My bad.

                                    HAROLD
                      Your bad?   What are the hell are we gonna
                      do now?!
               Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their
               direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops
               in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins
               walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon
               as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES.

               It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties,
               wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE
               BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump
               back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.

                                   UGLY MAN
                      You boys need some help?
               The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is
               freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP).
               HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out.

          80   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:20 AM                                    80
               The UGLY MAN'S TRUCK tows Harold's Infiniti down a dirt road.

          81   INT. TRUCK                                                  81
               The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is in the front seat, on the
               passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between them.

                                   HAROLD
                      Thanks for helping us out.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded
                      there and thought to myself, "what would
                      Jesus do?"
               Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a
               JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard...

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      So, you boys worship Christ?
               The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.

                            HAROLD                           KUMAR
               Uh...Yeah.                        Sure, he's great.

                                   UGLY MAN
                      Great. Good to hear it. The name's
                      Randy...but everyone calls me Freak Show.

                                   KUMAR
                      I'm Kumar. This is Harold.     Good to meet
                      you, Mr...Freak Show.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Pleasure's all mine.
               After a while, HAROLD starts to notice that they're driving
               in the middle of a dark woods. It looks very sketchy.

                                   HAROLD
                      So where exactly are we going?

                              FREAK SHOW
                 Don't worry. My place isn't too far from
                 here. Once we get there, I'll have your
                 ride fixed up in a jiffy.
          The guys silently continue driving, until KUMAR notices a

          RASH OF BOILS ON FREAK SHOW'S NECK.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering to Harold)
                 Eww-- check out those boils on his neck!
          HAROLD nudges him to be quiet. KUMAR looks back over at
          FREAK SHOW and sees that ONE OF THE BOILS IS PULSATING.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering)
                 Oh my God! You gotta look!     One of
                 them's actually pulsating!

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 Will you shut up? He's right next to me!
                 He can hear you!
          KUMAR sees that A WHITE PUSS IS NOW OOZING FROM THE BOIL.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering)
                 Now there's some sort of puss! It's the
                 most disgusting thing I've ever seen!

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 What's the matter with you? You think
                 that just because you're whispering, he
                 can't hear what you're saying? He's two
                 feet away from us. He can hear this
                 entire conversation. He can hear me
                 talking right now.

                              KUMAR
                        (whispering)
                 Don't worry, he can't hear anything.    Not
                 with all that crust in his ear.
          HAROLD gives KUMAR a hard elbow to the stomach. He then
          looks nervously at FREAK SHOW, who doesn't seem to have heard
          a thing. Harold seems relieved.

                              FREAK SHOW
                 I heard every word you said.
          FREAK SHOW doesn't say anything else. HAROLD and KUMAR don't
          know how to react. They feel really uncomfortable. The fact
          that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.

               HAROLD (with laptop in tow) and KUMAR stand by their car, as
               FREAK SHOW brings out some tools and a new tire from his
               house, which is run-down and in the middle of nowhere.

                                     FREAK SHOW
                        Now it's gonna take me a little while
                        here, so if you boys like you can go
                        inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have
                        something to drink, watch tv-- anything
                        you want. Mi casa es su casa. Just
                        don't do anything Jesus wouldn't do.
               FREAK SHOW gives HAROLD a pat on the back and starts changing
               the tire. KUMAR and HAROLD look at each other. Slowly, they
               walk towards FREAK SHOW's house...

                                     KUMAR
                        Am I deaf or did he just say we can fuck
                        his wife?

                                     HAROLD
                        He couldn't have said that.

                                     KUMAR
                        But he did! It may have been in mid-
                        sentence, but it was still clear as day.
               They reach the front door and are about to enter...

                                     HAROLD
                        Who cares? You've seen Freak Show. What
                        do you think his wife is gonna look like?

               HAROLD and KUMAR walk inside and see THE HOTTEST CHICK OF ALL
               TIME (LIANE) walk out of the kitchen. She is dressed Daisy
               Dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.

                                     LIANE
                        Hi. I'm Freak Show's wife, Liane.    Would
                        you boys like some pink lemonade?
               HAROLD and KUMAR can't move.   They're awestruck.

                                     LIANE
                        Let me go bring in a pitcher.
               LIANE   leaves to go into the kitchen. Along the way, she
               turns   on a record player, which starts playing a CREEPY SONG
               ABOUT   JESUS CHRIST. HAROLD and KUMAR look around the house.
               There   are crosses and Bible Verses on the walls, along with
               Freak   Show and Liane's wedding picture...

                              HAROLD
                 Okay. It's official.     We've entered the
                 Twilight Zone.

                              KUMAR
                 Dude, Liane is fucking hot!

                              HAROLD
                 She's not ugly.
          LIANE comes in with the pitcher of lemonade.    She pours them
          drinks and hands them the glasses...

                               KUMAR
                 Thanks.
                        (beat)
                 So, tell me Liane-- how are things
                 between you and Freak Show presently?

                              LIANE
                 Oh, never been better.    We love each
                 other very much.
          KUMAR looks disappointed.    HAROLD, however, is intrigued...

                              HAROLD
                 Can I ask-- how does a guy...like Freak
                 Show...end up with a woman like yourself?

                              LIANE
                 Well, I met him at choir practice `bout
                 four years ago. Freak Show was very shy
                 back then-- you know, because of all the
                 hideous boils on his face and neck. But
                 he had the most amazing voice -- like a
                 baby canary.
          Harold and Kumar look at each other in disbelief -- "are we
          talking about the same Freakshow?"

                              LIANE
                 Well, one day after Easter service, I
                 told him how much I enjoyed his solo, and
                 he just mustered up some courage and
                 asked me out. The rest is history. And
                 we've been in love ever since.
          HAROLD ponders this for a moment.    He and KUMAR begin
          drinking their lemonade.

                              LIANE
                 So you boys gonna fuck me or what?
          HAROLD and KUMAR spit the lemonade out simultaneously. They
          look at each other in complete shock. Kumar turns to Harold.

                              KUMAR
                 Rock, paper, scissors to see who goes
                 first?

                              HAROLD
                 Wait a second-- what about Freak
                 Show...and this whole Christian thing you
                 guys have going on?

                              LIANE
                        (a little offended)
                 Oh, so just because we're passionate
                 about our Lord, you assume we don't know
                 how to have a good time?

                              HAROLD
                 No, I just...
          Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and
          Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window,
          where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy.

                               HAROLD
                 Nevermind.
                        (to Kumar, swinging his
                         hand)
                 Okay, rock, paper, scissors...

                              LIANE
                 Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do
                 me at the same time.

                              HAROLD
                 Huh?

                               LIANE
                 Come on.   Give me the double stuff.
          HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused.

                              KUMAR
                 I'm not sure we quite understand...

                              LIANE
                 I want you both inside me simultaneously.
          HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and
          kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE...

                              KUMAR
                 Um, are we talking about one hole or two?

                              LIANE
                 However you want to do it.

                              HAROLD
                 Sorry, no thank you.

                               KUMAR
                        (to Harold)
                 Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad.
                        (beat)
                 Shotgun anus!

                              HAROLD
                 Forget it! I don't want our balls
                 rubbing against each other. No way!
          KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation...

                              KUMAR
                 What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow
                 jobs!?

                              LIANE
                 Well...okay.
                        (to Harold)
                 Can you help me with this...?
          Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous
          and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and
          puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar,
          who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the
          cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her
          shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her
          breasts.

                              LIANE
                        (to Harold, re: breasts)
                 Do you want to play with them?
          Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane...

                              HAROLD
                 Okay, let's do that.
          Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts.
          Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold
          starts to massage her chest.
          AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a
          particularly threatening TIRE-IRON...

                              FREAK SHOW
                 Hey boys-- I changed your tire...
          FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE...

                              FREAK SHOW
                 What the hell are you doing with my wife!

                                   HAROLD
                             (scared shitless)
                      Uhh...you said outside that we can have
                      sex with her!
               FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar!

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      I most certainly did not say that!

                                    KUMAR
                      No.   You did. We both heard you.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                             (calming down)
                      Are you sure?

                                    KUMAR
                      Positive.
               FREAK SHOW ponders this.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Oh...my mistake then.

                                    KUMAR
                      No problem.

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Well, since we're all here, why not make
                      it a foursome?

               FREAK SHOW PULLS HIS PANTS DOWN AND PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND

               HAROLD AND KUMAR...

                                   FREAK SHOW
                      Who wants the first reach-around?

          84   EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE                                      84
               HAROLD and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards
               their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can.

          85   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:45 AM                                     85
               Harold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods.

          86   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       86

                                   KUMAR
                      Okay, let's agree never to talk about
                      what just happened.

                                    HAROLD
                      Agreed.

               KUMAR searches for some clue of where they are.

                                   KUMAR
                      Dude, I have no idea where we are.
               All of a sudden, A HITCHHIKER waves them down up ahead.

                                   KUMAR
                      Hey, a hitchhiker. Should we pick him up?

                                   HAROLD
                      And get chopped to bits?     Are you crazy?
               Kumar pulls over to the side of the road...

                                   KUMAR
                      Oh, calm down. We're lost. He may know
                      how to get us back on the highway.

                                   HAROLD
                      Fuck that! It's my car! We're not
                      picking up a hitchhiker!
               The back door opens and Neil (hitchhiker), gets into the car.

                                   NEIL
                      Yo, man, thanks for picking me up.
               HAROLD and KUMAR look at NEIL and then look at each other.
               THEY ARE IN COMPLETE SHOCK. Harold is no longer angry.

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Neil)
                      Uh...excuse me, but...are you Neil
                      Patrick Harris?

                                      NEIL
                      Yep.

                                   KUMAR
                      Holy shit, dude! Doogie Howser, M.D. was
                      my favorite TV show growing up! You were
                      my idol!

                                    NEIL
                             (curt)
                      Hey, that's great. Do you think we could
                      get going? I'm bored as shit back here.

          87   EXT. DIRT ROAD                                                87
               We see Harold's Infiniti drive back onto the road...

                                   KUMAR
                      So, Neil, I have to ask you-- did you
                      ever get it on with Wanda off the set?

                                   NEIL
                      Dude, I humped every piece of ass ever on
                      that show.

                                   KUMAR
                      Even the chick who played the hot nurse?

                                   NEIL
                      No, I didn't go all the way with her.

                                   HAROLD
                      Hey, you don't know how to get back on
                      the highway, do you?

                                   NEIL
                      I don't even know where the fuck I am
                      right now. I was at this party earlier
                      tonight, and this dude hooked me up with
                      some killer X. Somehow I ended up
                      getting thrown out of a moving car, and
                      I've been tripping balls ever since.
               HAROLD and KUMAR both find this to be quite strange.

                                   KUMAR
                      Well, our night's been pretty crazy too.
                      We've been driving around for hours,
                      trying to get to White Castle, but we
                      keep getting sidetracked.

                                   NEIL
                      Dude, forget White Castle.   What we need
                      is some pussy.

                                   HAROLD
                      Huh?

                                   NEIL
                      It's a fucking sausage fest in here.
                      Let's get us some poon-tang. Then we'll
                      go to White Castle.

                                   KUMAR
                      You don't understand, Neil. We've been
                      craving these burgers all night.

                                   NEIL
                      I've been craving burgers too.   Fur
                      burgers, that is.

                                   NEIL (cont'd)
                      Let's pick up some trim at a strip club.
                      The Doogie line always works on
                      strippers.
               HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- weirded out.

                                   KUMAR
                      Hey, there's a gas station! Let's stop
                      and get directions.
               KUMAR quickly makes a turn onto a NORMAL-LOOKING STREET
               leading up to a gas station in the distance...

          89   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE - 1:50 AM                  89
               HAROLD and KUMAR get out of the car.   NEIL is still in the
               backseat. The car is still running.

                                   HAROLD
                      We'll be right back, Neil.
               NEIL shakes his head, disappointed. Harold and Kumar start
               walking over to the CONVENIENCE STORE.

                                   HAROLD
                      What's the deal with Neil Patrick Harris?
                      Why's he so horny?

                                   KUMAR
                      I don't know. But we can't let him
                      interfere with our quest.
               Suddenly, Cole's Yellow Jeep drives right by them. They have
               to jump out of the way. Cole parks the jeep and exits with

               TWO OF THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS.

                                   COLE
                      Late night math league meeting, homos?

                                   EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                             (to Cole)
                      Extreme!

                                   HAROLD
                             (upset)
                      Oh shit. These idiots.
               Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk
               into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them...

          90   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE                                        90
               HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and
               the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from
               the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a
               HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS
               SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests...

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    66.

          

          

                              INDIAN CASHIER
                        (to Cole and the punks)
                 Please...the pies...do not...
          Cole and the Punks ignore him.    Harold and Kumar then
          approach the Indian Cashier...

                              HAROLD
                 Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get
                 onto the highway from here?
          The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Harold)
                 He probably can't speak English...

          KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE
          CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the
          directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to
          explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It
          sounds like it's very complicated.
          Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO
          MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK
          AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store.
          Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the
          CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches
          nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK...

                              KUMAR
                 Who knew that learning Hindi would
                 actually pay off? The guy says the
                 highway's just down the road. We should
                 be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes.
          HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS...

                               HAROLD
                         (to Kumar)
                 Huh?   Oh, good.

                              COLE (O.S.)

                 EXTREME KAYAKING!!!
          HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and
          look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY

          THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH

          THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR...
          In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid-
          air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS,

          GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC.
          The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR,
          and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief.

          

                          DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003    67.

          

          
          The kayak lands on the floor.     COLE gets out and celebrates
          with his friends.

                                 COLE
                    That was so fucking extreme, man!

                                 EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                    Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten--
                    one being not so extreme, ten being
                    extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine
                    point five.
          Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy
          throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves,
          bothering other customers.
          The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI.
          Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of
          various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an
          other.    Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS.
          He goes   apeshit over his find.

                                 EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                    Extreme Cheddar!
          He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth,
          getting the chips all over the place.
          The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.      Cole picks up the
          Cashier...

                                 COLE
                    Extreme Cashier!!!
          Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER
          around and around.

                                 HAROLD
                    Somebody should do something.

                                 KUMAR
                           (to Cole)
                    Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy
                    alone and go jerk off to some
                    snowboarding videos or something.

                                  EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS
                    Oooooooooh!
          Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the
          floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get
          their asses kicked.

          

                              DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   68.

          

          

                                   HAROLD
                             (to Kumar)
                      I didn't mean you should do something.
               Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face.
               Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior.
               It's a tense moment.
               Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit
               Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground
               without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks
               don't know what to think as their leader is shown up.
               Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as
               if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back,
               doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard,
               this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling...

                                    KUMAR
                              (pissed off at himself)
                      Shit.
               Cole and the Punks burst out laughing.

                                   COLE
                      Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking
                      with me one more time. Just try it!
               Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest.

                                   KUMAR
                             (to Kumar, embarrassed)
                      Come on, lets get out of here.
               Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their
               leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating.

                                   COLE
                             (like Apu)
                      Thank you, come again!

          91   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE                           91
               HAROLD and KUMAR walk back towards their car...

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar-- you okay?

                                    KUMAR
                      Yeah, I just hate those dicks.
                             (beat)
                      Fuck it. At least now we know where we're
                      going. I'm so friggin' hungry...

               SUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CAR ENGINE START.    HAROLD AND KUMAR STOP

               WALKING AND LOOK OVER AT KUMAR'S CAR.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   69.

          

          THEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY

          WATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES

          OFF, DRIVING THROUGH A SIGN, AND GETTING ON THE ROAD...
          Harold and Kumar stand there for fifteen seconds, without
          saying a word, as they watch the car slowly disappear in the
          distance. Eventually, Harold breaks the silence...

                               HAROLD
                        (calm)
                 Did Doogie Howser just steal my fucking
                 car?

                              KUMAR
                 I think he did.

                              HAROLD

                 FUCK!!!!!!
                        (to Kumar)
                 You! You had to pick up a hitchhiker!

                              KUMAR
                 Rold, calm down!

                              HAROLD
                 Why the hell did you leave the keys in
                 the car?!

                              KUMAR
                 I figured that Neil Patrick Harris was a
                 trustworthy guy. How was I supposed to
                 know that he'd fuck us over?

                              HAROLD
                 This is all your fault! This whole
                 fucking night! You know I leased that
                 car! They're gonna make me pay for it!
          Harold starts to walk back to the convenience store.

                              KUMAR
                 Where are you going?

                              HAROLD
                 I'm going to call the police!   I don't
                 want to talk to you anymore!
          Harold is about to walk in, when he sees Cole wind up and
          throw a Hostess-like snowball right in the Cashier's face.
          "Extremes" all around!

                              KUMAR
                 There's a pay phone across the street, if
                 you don't want to deal with those
                 assholes.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   70.

          

          
          Harold turns around and walks back towards the street. Kumar
          walks with him, keeping his distance. They reach the street.
          On the other side, he sees AN ORANGE "DON'T WALK" SIGN LIT
          UP. Harold presses the "WALK" BUTTON on the post next to him.

                              KUMAR
                 So after you talk to the cops we're still
                 going to White Castle, right?

                              HAROLD
                 I'm not speaking to you.
          Harold waits for the "DON'T WALK" sign to change. It
          doesn't. HE STARTS PRESSING THE "WALK" BUTTON REPEATEDLY.

                              KUMAR
                 You know, pressing the button a bunch of
                 times doesn't make the sign change any
                 faster. The computer responds to the
                 first press. Every press after that is
                 extraneous.

                              HAROLD
                 Thank you, Mr. Wizard.
          HAROLD waits for a few seconds, but when the light doesn't
          change, he begins pressing the button again.

                              HAROLD
                 Jesus Christ! When are they gonna
                 fucking develop button technology that'll
                 understand urgency?
          The "DON'T WALK" sign still won't change. Kumar looks to the
          left and then to the right. The street is completely empty
          and there is no place for a police car to hide.

                              KUMAR
                 This is ridiculous.   Just walk across.

                              HAROLD
                 It'll change in a second.
          They stand there for another ten seconds.   It doesn't change.

                              KUMAR
                 Come on, there's not a car in sight!

                              HAROLD
                 Alright fine. You want me to cross?
                 I'll cross. Just leave me alone!
          Harold starts walking angrily across the street.

                              KUMAR
                 Finally.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   71.

          

          
          Before Kumar has a chance to follow, a POLICE CAR FROM OUT OF

          NOWHERE FLASHES ITS LIGHTS AND STOPS HAROLD DEAD IN HIS

          TRACKS.

                               HAROLD
                 Shit!
          Harold walks back over to Kumar, clearly upset within him, as
          OFFICER PALUMBO (30's, good looking, tough) gets out of the
          car and walks over to them...

                              HAROLD
                        (looking at cop's name-
                         tag)
                 Good evening. Is there a problem,
                 Officer...Palumbo?

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Is there a problem? Ever hear of
                 jaywalking?

                              HAROLD
                 Yes. Yes I have. I'm so sorry. I promise
                 I'll never do it again.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Yeah, like I give a fuck. I'm writing
                 you up a ticket.
          OFFICER PALUMBO begins writing a ticket.    Kumar walks over,
          flabbergasted...

                               KUMAR
                 A ticket?!   Are you serious?
          Harold motions Kumar to "shut the fuck up!"

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                        (to Kumar, unthreatened)
                 Who the fuck are you, shitwad?

                              HAROLD
                        (stepping in front of
                         Kumar)
                 Let me apologize for my friend. I promise
                 I will pay the fine. But actually, I'm
                 glad you're here. You know the TV show
                 Doogie Howser, M.D? You see, Doogie
                 Howser just stole my car and...

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Pipe down and give me your ID.

                              KUMAR
                        (to Officer Palumbo)
                 Wait. Hold on.

                              KUMAR (cont'd)
                 How can you give him a ticket for
                 jaywalking? I mean, look at this street!
                 He wasn't causing traffic or anything!

                              HAROLD
                 Kumar, shut up...

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                        (to Kumar)
                 Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on
                 a cop who could bust your ass.

                              KUMAR
                 Bust my ass?!

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass.
                        (to Harold)
                 What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with
                 like three o's and shit. What happened to
                 good old fashioned American names like
                 Dave, Jim...
          Harold points to his ID.

                              HAROLD
                 Harold.
          Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Yes. Harold. That's a great name.    You
                 should be proud of that name, son.

                              HAROLD
                 Thank you.
          OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk
          away.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 As you were, ladies.
          Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it.

                              KUMAR
                 220 dollars!? Are you crazy?
          Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys.

                              HAROLD
                 Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't...

                              KUMAR
                        (to Officer Palumbo)
                 No, no, no. I understand what's going on.

          

                             DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   73.

          

          
               Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block
               him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement
               towards him.

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                      Hey, hands down! No sudden moves!
               Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with
               Palumbo improvising little responses.

                                   KUMAR
                      Let me guess. You were probably the big
                      asshole in your high school, right?
                      You'd pick on guys like us every day.
                      But then graduation came, and we went to
                      college and you went nowhere, so you
                      thought, "How can I still give them shit?
                      I know! I'll become a cop!" Well,
                      congratulations. Your dream's come true.
               Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed.
               Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to
               Palumbo.

                                   KUMAR
                             (to Officer Palumbo)
                      Hey, while you're at it, why don't you
                      write him up another ticket? Or better
                      yet, arrest him. Lock him up!
               With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees
               Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends
               up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!!

                                      HAROLD
                      Oh shit.

          92   INT. JAIL CELL - 2:30 AM                                    92
               The CELL DOOR SLAMS.    Harold is behind bars.

                                   HAROLD
                             (calling out)
                      Hey, are you gonna do something about my
                      car? Hello?
               Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE
               ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check.

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                      Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation
                      to our Police Charity is very
                      appreciated.

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     74.

          

          

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM
                 Well, thank you for being so
                 understanding about Bradley. I promise
                 you he won't ever do it again.

                              OFFICER PALUMBO
                 Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the
                 talk we had, right Brad?
          Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look.

                              HIPPIE ASSHOLE
                        (shaken)
                 Mom-- please take me home...
          The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a
          frightened child.
          Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we
          see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's
          WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on
          Harold...
          Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars...

                              HAROLD
                 Can I at least give you my car's licence
                 plate number?
          Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio...

                              RADIO   ANNOUNCER
                 The search for the   escaped cheetah
                 continues tonight.   It was last spotted in
                 Randolph Township,   heading South...
          Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him
          is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold
          sits down, across from Tarik.
          While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the
          cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it.

                              HAROLD
                 So what are you in here for?

                              TARIK
                 For being black.

                               HAROLD
                 Come on.   Seriously.
          TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his
          Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation.

          

                         DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   75.

          

          

                              TARIK
                 I am serious. You wanna know what
                 happened?
          Harold nods.

                              TARIK
                 I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble,
                 and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black
                 man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore,
                 since I'm black, it was probably me,
                 right?
          Harold shrugs his shoulders.

                              TARIK
                 Well that was the logic the cop used. I
                 told him I haven't even been to Newark in
                 months. Then he pointed a gun at me and
                 told me to stop resisting arrest. I
                 said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything."
                 So he starts beating me with his gun,
                 screaming at me, telling me to stop
                 resisting.

                               HAROLD
                 Holy shit.   What did you do?

                              TARIK
                 I kept saying, "I understand that I'm
                 under arrest. Please stop beating me."
                 But that didn't work. Then another cop
                 showed up. Then another. When it was
                 all said and done, it took nine cops to
                 bring me in here.

                              HAROLD
                 That fucking blows!
          Tarik nods and continues reading his book.    Harold sees that
          Tarik is remarkably relaxed.

                              HAROLD
                 I don't understand how you're able to be
                 so calm about all this.

                               TARIK
                 Son, I'm fat. I'm black. I can't dance.
                 And I have two gay fathers. I've had
                 people messing with me my whole life.
                        (beat)
                 I learned a long time ago, there's no
                 point in getting all riled up every time
                 a bunchy of idiots gives you a hard time.
                 Because in the end, the universe tends to
                 unfold as it should.

          

                             DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   76.

          

          
               Harold takes this all in.

                                   TARIK
                      So what are you in here for?

                                   HAROLD
                      Assaulting an officer.

                                   TARIK
                      They tried to pin that shit on you too?

                                   HAROLD
                      No. I actually did hit the cop. But
                      only because I was trying to hit my
                      friend. Well, ex-friend.

          
               Suddenly, OFFICER REILLY hangs up the phone on his desk. He
               shouts out to the other officers in the room:

                                   OFFICER REILLY
                      Hey, listen up guys! Multiple gun shots
                      fired in Millbrook Park! It sounds bad!

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                      Finally, some action! I'm going!
               Another cop, OFFICER MARTONE, gets up...

                                   OFFICER MARTONE
                      No-- I'm going!
               All six officers in the room jump out of their desks and run
               for the door. Harold and Tarik can't believe it.

          93   EXT. POLICE STATION - CONTINUOUS                            93
               We see the officers get into their POLICE CARS and drive off.

          94   INT. JAIL CELL - CONTINUOUS                                 94
               Harold and Tarik are now left all alone in their cell.

                                   HAROLD
                      That was strange.
               Suddenly, a loud banging sound is made from a VENTILATION
               SHAFT on the ceiling, above one of the officer's desks.

                                   HAROLD
                      What the hell was that?

                                  KUMAR (O.C.)
                            (from inside the shaft)
                      Rold? Is that you?

          

                        DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   77.

          

          
          Although his voice is muffled, we can hear Kumar's words.
          Tarik is very confused.

                              HAROLD
                        (shouting out)
                 Kumar?! What the fuck are you doing?!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Are the cops still there?

                               HAROLD
                 No, they...   Wait a second, did you...

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 I called and made up some story about a
                 shooting in Millbrook park...

                              HAROLD
                 Jesus Christ! What did you do that for?!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 I'm fucking starving! I figured I'd bust
                 you out, and we'd get over to White
                 Castle.

                              HAROLD
                 Forget it! I don't want to get in any
                 more trouble! I'm already in here because
                 of you!

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Hey, fuck you! What did you want me to
                 do? Stand there and take the hit? You
                 know, I've never taken a swing at you
                 before. Never.

                              HAROLD
                 Well, I never got your car stolen!

                              TARIK
                 Hey, I'm trying to read here.

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Look, Rold, I'm sorry. But you're not
                 the only one dealing with shit. My dad's
                 cutting me off, remember?

                              HAROLD
                 Hey asshole, I'm in jail! Don't bitch to
                 me about your problems! Just leave me
                 alone. I don't want your help.

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 You don't want my help? Fine!    I'm outta
                 here!

          We hear a couple banging sounds from the ventilation shaft.
          Then a couple more. Then a couple more. Pouting, Harold
          pretends to ignore it.

                                KUMAR (O.C.)
                 Uh...Rold?    How do I get out of here?
          Tarik rolls his eyes in disbelief.

                              HAROLD
                 How the hell should I know?

                              KUMAR (O.C.)
                 This isn't good.
          We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE

          VENTILATION SHAFT BREAKS OFF THE CEILING AND KUMAR FALLS OUT

          ONTO THE GROUND...

                              HAROLD
                 Jesus Christ.
          Tarik shakes his head.

                                KUMAR
                 Ow...my ass.
          Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell.

                              KUMAR
                 You sure you don't want to get out?

                              HAROLD
                 And become a fugitive? Are you nuts?
                 The guy has all my information.
          Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report,
          Harold's I.D., and his laptop.

                               KUMAR
                 So what? We'll take everything he wrote
                 down about you and leave.
                        (beat)
                 Unless you want to stay here all night
                 and not be able to hand your work in
                 tomorrow.
          Harold thinks about this for a second.

                                HAROLD
                 Fine.    Hurry up.
          Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key.

               Kumar finds A BIG METAL KEY RING on Palumbo's desk...

                                   KUMAR
                      Yes! I was hoping it would be one of
                      these big ring of keys. Now I get to try
                      all of them to see which one will...

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar, hurry the fuck up!
               Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple
               keys, when he suddenly smells something...

                                   KUMAR
                      What's that smell?
               Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on
               Officer Reilly's desk.

                                   HAROLD
                      Kumar?...Kumar!
               Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a
               romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED...

               It's a beautiful, sunny day in the park, as KUMAR pushes THE
               BAG OF WEED on a swing, like young lovers do in movies...

               KUMAR has his arms around THE BAG OF WEED as he helps it
               swing the golf club. It's a hole in one! KUMAR TURNS THE

               BAG OF WEED AROUND AND GIVES IT A KISS.

               CARICATURE SKETCH ARTIST. The Artist reveals his sketch to
               Kumar and The Bag of Weed. It obviously looks ridiculous.

                 THE BAG OF WEED is holding a box containing pictures and
                 memorabilia of it's relationship to the HIPPIE ASSHOLE. The
                 Bag of Weed throws the box in a GARBAGE CAN.
                 Kumar lights a match and throws it in the can, setting it
                 aflame. He and the bag of weed face each other and kiss...

                 BAG OF WEED starts to go under the covers. We watch, as the
                 sheets move up and down. KUMAR STARTS TO HAVE AN ORGASM...
                 THE BAG OF WEED comes up from under the covers. Kumar gives
                 it a kiss. THEN, HE GOES UNDER THE COVERS. We see THE BAG

                 OF WEED START TO TREMBLE AND SHUDDER IN ECSTASY...

                 KUMAR (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is
                 frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing
                 a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF

                 COFFEE. IT GIVES KUMAR THE COFFEE. KUMAR TAKES A SIP. IT'S

                 TOO COLD. HE SPITS IT OUT AND SLAPS THE BAG OF WEED...

                 DEPRESSED, THE BAG OF WEED WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE...
                 KUMAR hears THE BAG OF WEED crying from the other room.   He
                 obviously feels guilty...

                 KUMAR GETS UP AND RUNS OVER TO THE BAG OF WEED. HE PICKS IT

                 UP, GIVES IT A KISS, AND EMBRACES IT WITH ALL OF HIS SOUL...

                Kumar walks away from the cell, goes over to the desk, picks
                up the bag of weed and caresses it...

                                    HAROLD
                       What the hell are you...
                Suddenly, all six police officer come back into the room,
                pushing a black man wearing pajamas (NATHANIEL BANKS).
                Nathaniel seems very gentle. He's even wearing a turtleneck
                sweater.

                                    OFFICER PALUMBO
                              (to Nathaniel)
                       You thought you could get away with this,
                       huh?

                                    NATHANIEL
                       Where am I? I was in bed.         I didn't fire
                       any gun, I swear...
                Suddenly, Officer Reilly looks over to the jail cell...

                                 (pointing)
                       Look!
                All the cops turn to the cell. Kumar is still holding the
                weed. He doesn't know what to do. Harold is scared shitless.

                                   OFFICER PALUMBO
                             (re: Tarik)
                       Shit! Jackson's trying to escape!
                Tarik looks up from his book...

                                       TARIK
                       What?     Oh, not again!
                The cops handcuff Nathaniel to the leg of a desk, and run
                over to the jail cell, ignoring Kumar and the weed.

                                    OFFICER PALUMBO
                       Stop trying to escape!

                       I'm not trying to escape!        Look at me,
                       I'm sitting down!
                They turn the key that is already in the keyhole and storm
                into the room. Harold stands back, confused. Tarik leans
                against the wall, ready to be handcuffed. The cops grab him
                and throw him down against the bed.

                In the midst of all the action, Kumar grabs Harold and pulls
                him out of the cell. HAROLD GOES OVER TO PALUMBO'S DESK AND
                PICKS UP HIS WALLET AND LAPTOP, along with the police report.
                They start running out of the room. Kumar's still clinging
                to the weed.

                                    HAROLD
                              (to Kumar)

                       If I were you, I'd get out of here as
                       soon as possible.

                HAROLD and KUMAR (still clinging to the weed) burst out the
                door and run down the steps. They race through the street
                and start heading towards a FOREST.

                                      KUMAR

                HAROLD and KUMAR have stopped running.   They start catching
                their breath.

                                    HAROLD
                       Jesus Christ! That place was a fucking
                       mad house! Thanks for getting me out of

                       from being broke to being millionaires.
                Suddenly, they hear what sounds like A COYOTE'S HOWL.

                                    HAROLD
                       What was that?

                                    KUMAR
                       Just a coyote. Don't worry.

                 Aren't people supposed to be scared of
                 coyotes?

                              KUMAR
                 That's only because they sound scary. In
                 one on one combat, either one of us can
                 take a coyote down.

          SUDDENLY, A CHEETAH JUMPS OUT FROM BEHIND A BUSH AND LETS OUT

          A MONSTROUS ROAR!

                              KUMAR (CONT'D)
                 Now cheetahs, they're another story.
          The CHEETAH stares HAROLD and KUMAR down.

                              HAROLD
                 We're gonna die.

                              KUMAR
                 Just calm down. Cheetahs are used to
                 eating zebras and shit. They're not
                 known for eating humans.

          WITH THAT, THE CHEETAH WALKS OVER TO A NEARBY BUSH AND DRAGS

          OUT A HALF-EATEN HUMAN CORPSE IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN DEVOURING.

                              HAROLD
                 We're gonna die.

                              KUMAR
                 Okay, I'll admit, that's not a good sign.
                 But I'm sure if we just stay calm he'll
                 probably leave us alone.
          HAROLD and KUMAR stand silently. SLOWLY, the CHEETAH begins
          walking directly over to HAROLD...

                              HAROLD
                        (whispering)
                 This isn't working.

                               KUMAR
                 Shhh.
          Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON

          WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAROLD'S GROIN AREA.

                              HAROLD
                        (eyes closed, screaming)

                 HE'S MAULING ME! HE'S MAULING ME!
          HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS.
          Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH.

                THE CHEETAH IS NOT EATING HAROLD.    HE'S EATING THE BEEF JERKY

                THAT HAROLD HAD IN HIS PANTS.

                                    KUMAR
                              (annoyed)
                       I thought I told you not to take that
                       jerky!
                HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't
                been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins
                licking Harold's face in friendship.

                                      HAROLD
                       He likes me.
                Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up...

                                    KUMAR
                       Dude, I think I have an idea.

                                      HAROLD
                       What is it?

                                    KUMAR
                       I'll tell you, but first we have to get
                       really high.
                Kumar opens the bag of weed.
                Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   We see smoke
                coming up from below. Pan back down...

                Harold and Kumar are now sitting on top of the CHEETAH,
                smoking joints. Kumar has a belt around the cheetah's neck
                like reigns on a horse.

                                    HAROLD
                       Has it come to this?    Are we really gonna
                       ride this cheetah?

                                    KUMAR
                       Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on
                       the planet. It's as good as a car.
                Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away.

                                    HAROLD
                       This is either a really smart move, or by
                       far the stupidest thing we've ever done.
                HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.    Kumar puts the
                bag of weed under his shirt...

                                    KUMAR
                       Well, we'll soon find out.
                              (like to a snow dog)
                       Mush! Mush!

                SUDDENLY, THE CHEETAH DARTS OUT LIKE LIGHTENING WITH HAROLD

                AND KUMAR ON IT'S BACK. EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO

                SENSE, WE SEE THE CHEETAH ZOOMING PAST STREETS AND FORESTS.

                HAROLD AND KUMAR ARE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN AS IT RACES ACROSS

                A MAJOR HIGHWAY...

                                    HAROLD
                       Dude, am I just really high or is this is
                       actually working?!

                                     KUMAR
                       Both!

                                    HAROLD
                       This is great! We'll be at White Castle
                       in no...

                SMACK! A BRANCH HITS HAROLD IN THE FACE, KNOCKING HIM OFF THE
                CHEETAH. Harold lands on the ground-- his head bleeding.
                His eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious...

          109   EXT. THE LAND OF BURGERS - DAY                              109
                THE LAND OF BURGERS is an OZ-like world-- the entire terrain,
                with all it's rolling hills, IS MADE UP OF HAMBURGERS. Music
                plays as HAROLD and MARIA skip through THE LAND OF BURGERS,
                holding hands.
                Along the way, they run by...
                The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with
                each other, in white tuxedos. HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY
                gives Harold the same scary look from before....
                FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a
                wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out
                a CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with.
                KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while
                getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly         
                gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male
                Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy.
                Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill,
                UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger
                from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed
                each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into
                each other's eyes...

                                    MARIA
                       I love you, Harold.

                                    HAROLD
                       I love you, Maria.
                MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her.
                Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE

                FRENCH FRIES FROM THE BRANCH AND FEEDS THEM TO HAROLD.             

                                    COLE (O.S.)
                       Wow, you guys are really extreme...
                HAROLD turns and sees COLE KAYAKING DOWN A NEARBY STREAM...

                                    COLE
                       ...extremely gay that is.

                SUDDENLY, AN ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH COLE'S NECK! BLOOD

                STARTS GUSHING OUT. HE FALLS OFF THE KAYAK, INTO THE WATER.
                HAROLD is shocked. He turns around and sees MARIA, HOLDING A
                CROSSBOW. She smiles at him. HE THEN JUMPS ON TOP OF HER

                AND THEY BEGIN MAKING LOVE ON TOP OF THE BURGERS...

                                    MARIA
                       Oh Harold! Yes! Yes! Oh, God-- you
                       have the biggest dick of all time! It's
                       so long! And wide, for that matter!
                Suddenly, Harold turns and sees the BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE
                lying down near them. He is staring at them, with no
                expression on his face, with his hand down his pants--
                rubbing his penis furiously. Harold is disturbed.

                                    MARIA
                       Don't worry about him...
                MARIA rolls over so SHE'S ON TOP OF HAROLD. SHE STARTS

                LICKING HIS FACE, LIKE A DOG. WHEN SHE DOESN'T STOP LICKING,

                HAROLD STARTS GETTING A LITTLE CONFUSED...

                HAROLD wakes up to find KUMAR LICKING HIS FACE.   HAROLD JUMPS

                AWAY FROM HIM...

                              HAROLD
                 What the hell are you doing?!!!

                              KUMAR
                 I'm sorry! You've been out cold for the
                 past half-hour! I figured that maybe if
                 I did some gay shit you'd wake up.
          HAROLD wipes his face with his sleeve. He then gets up-- he
          sees that they are by a random road, all by themselves.

                              HAROLD
                 What happened to the cheetah?

                              KUMAR
                 It ran away. But forget about that. I
                 have some bad news and some worse news.

                              HAROLD
                        (nervous)
                 Tell me the worse news first.

                              KUMAR
                 I checked out some road signs. The
                 cheetah took us in the wrong direction.

                                HAROLD
                 That sucks.    What's the bad news?

                              KUMAR
                 Your laptop is completely destroyed.
          Kumar points to the laptop, which is outside of it's bag,
          broken in pieces.

                                HAROLD

                 WHAT????????

                              KUMAR
                 It smashed against a tree when you fell
                 off the cheetah.

                              HAROLD
                 Why the hell didn't you say that THAT was
                 the "worse news"?

                              KUMAR
                 Well, the laptop really only effects you.
                 Whereas the White Castle situation
                 effects both of us equally.

                              HAROLD
                 Oh no! No! No!

                THE STRIPPERS ARE ALL OVER NEIL, KISSING HIS NECK, AND

                ONE OF THE STRIPPERS LIES ACROSS THE FRONT SEAT WITH HER ASS

                IN FRONT OF NEIL. ANOTHER STRIPPER POURS A LINE OF COCAINE ON

                right past them, splashing a puddle in Harold's face!
                They stand there, watching silently as NEIL drives off.
                Harold is now drenched. Muddy water drips from his hair and
                clothing. He gives Kumar a dirty look. Kumar knows he
                shouldn't push Harold any further.

                        Oh great.     Here we go again.
                 COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS are hacky-sacking in the

                        Fucking asshole.
                 Suddenly, HAROLD stops in his tracks. He's noticed something
                 through the Krispee Kreme window. He stops KUMAR and
                 points...

                                        HAROLD
                        Look!
                 Through the window, we see ROSENBERG and GOLDSTEIN inside,
                 sitting at a booth. They both have a dozen donuts and five
                 cartons of milk. It looks like they just sat down...
                 Goldstein savors his first bite of his POWDERED BLUEBERRY
                 FILLED DONUT and Rosenberg licks his fingers after his first
                 bite of his CHOCOLATE CREAM FILLED DONUT.
                 HAROLD and KUMAR watch through the window longingly...

                              HAROLD
                        (yearning)
                 I want that.

                                KUMAR
                 What?    A chocolate cream filled?

                               HAROLD
                 No.  I want that feeling.
                        (beat)
                 The feeling that comes over a man when he
                 finally gets exactly what he desires.
                        (beat)
                 I NEED that feeling.

                              KUMAR
                 Are you saying what I think you're
                 saying?

                              HAROLD
                 We gotta go to White Castle.
          KUMAR gives HAROLD a hug.

                                KUMAR
                 Yes!    I knew you had it in you!
          Suddenly, Kumar notices something else inside. Someone else
          is sitting down at Rosenberg & Goldstein's table...

                              KUMAR
                 Is that Cindy Kim?
          Harold watches as Cindy Kim sits down next to Goldstein.
          Goldstein puts his arm around her and feeds her a piece of
          donut. It looks like Goldstein and Cindy are "an item."

                              KUMAR
                 You should have boned her when you had
                 the chance.
          Before Harold can respond, he's hit in the back of the head
          by a hacky sack! Cole and the Punks laugh at Harold.

                              HAROLD
                        (to Cole)
                 Hey, why don't you just leave us alone?

                             COLE
                 Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it,
                 Mr. Miagi?
          Cole gets in the CRANE POSITION a la THE KARATE KID...
          Harold is quiet for a moment as he looks at Cole's little
          racist routine. He then lets out a little laugh...

          

                              DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003   91.

          

          

                                    HAROLD
                       Nothing.
                Harold turns around and starts walking towards the Krispee
                Kreme entrance. Kumar follows. In the background Cole and the
                Punks are laughing about what a "pussy" Harold is.

                                    KUMAR
                              (pissed off, but
                               powerless)
                       Fuck! I'm so sick of their bullshit!

                                    HAROLD
                              (totally calm)
                       Don't worry. The universe tends to
                       unfold as it should.
                Kumar gives a "What the fuck is he talking about?" look.

                                    HAROLD
                       Besides, I have a plan.   Follow my
                       lead...

                                    KUMAR
                       Your lead?
                Harold walks past the Krispee Kreme entrance and heads
                towards the YELLOW JEEP at a brisk pace. KUMAR follows.

                SUDDENLY, HAROLD SNATCHES COLE'S KEYS FROM THE HOOD OF THE

                JEEP AND RUSHES INSIDE THE DRIVER'S SIDE.
                One of the Extreme Sports Punks sees Harold doing this...

                                     EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                       Hey, Cole!   Look!
                Cole turns to see Harold in his car. Kumar is about to get
                in the passenger's side. Cole and the Punks start running
                towards the car! Kumar sees this and quickly gets inside.
                HAROLD puts the car in reverse, nearly hitting the punks.

          114   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     114
                Harold is shifting gears...

                                    KUMAR
                       What the hell are you doing?!

                                    HAROLD
                       I'm stealing their car.

                                    KUMAR
                       This is your plan?

                                    HAROLD
                       It's working isn't it?

          

                               DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    92.

          

          
                Harold drives the car out of the parking lot.   Cole and the
                Punks give chase on their skateboards.

                                    KUMAR
                              (laughing)
                       Hey, slow down to like 25 mph, so they
                       think they have a chance to catch up.

          115   EXT. ROAD                                                   115
                Harold drives COLE'S JEEP down at a speed just slow enough
                for COLE and the PUNKS to think that they have a chance...

          116   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     116
                Kumar then sticks his head out the window...

                                    KUMAR
                              (in thick Indian Accent)
                       Thank you, come again!
                Harold guns it-- leaving Cole and the Punks in the dust.

          117   EXT. ROAD                                                   117
                We see Cole and the Punks watching in disbelief as Harold and
                Kumar drive off with their car.

                                    EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1
                       Dude, that was so NOT extreme!

                                    COLE
                       I know Extreme Sports Punk #1, I know.
                The Extreme Sports Punks walk away, leaving Cole by himself.

          118   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     118
                HAROLD and KUMAR are laughing and slapping five.

                                    KUMAR
                       Victory is sweet! Nice job, Roldy!

                                    HAROLD
                       I had to do something.
                KUMAR begins sniffing something in the air...

                                     KUMAR
                       Wait.   Do you smell that?
                KUMAR keeps sniffing. He turns around to the back seat. He
                reaches back and picks something up from off the floor. It's
                a WHITE CASTLE bag. He pours out the contents and we see
                EMPTY WHITE CASTLE HAMBURGER CARTONS fall onto Kumar's lap.

                                    KUMAR
                       Those assholes got to have White Castle?!

                                    HAROLD
                       This world is so unfair.

                                    KUMAR
                       Don't worry . Forget about that. We
                       have a car now. We're back in the game.
                       Pretty soon we'll be eating our own White
                       Castle. Want me to drive?

                                    HAROLD
                       No. I've got everything under control. We
                       should be able to get there with enough
                       time for me to get my work done after our
                       feast. Just find us some tunes.
                A tape is resting in the tape deck.   KUMAR pushes it in...
                HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other amazed that COLE has some
                lame chick song on his tape.

                                    KUMAR
                       Those guys are fucking posers!

                We see COLE'S YELLOW JEEP speeding along the highway. We see
                signs indicating they're getting closer to Cherry Hill...

          120   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                    120
                Harold and Kumar are now listening to another lame chick
                song. While they aren't fully embracing the song, it's clear
                they're kind of enjoying it.

          121   EXT. HIGHWAY                                               121
                The guys take the Cherry Hill exit.

                Harold and Kumar are singing along passionately to a third
                lame chick song.

                A SIGN READS "YOU ARE NOW ENTERING CHERRY HILL."

                They're speeding down a road lined by forests on both sides.
                We see the Jeep speeds by a COP CAR...

                OFFICER BRUCKS (middle-aged, tough, toothpick in his mouth)
                sees the yellow jeep speed by. He reloads his rifle...

                                      OFFICER BRUCKS
                       Bingo.

          127   INT. COLE'S YELLOW JEEP                                     127
                HAROLD and KUMAR are still singing...
                All of a sudden, HAROLD and KUMAR hear a POLICE SIREN.

                                      KUMAR
                       Oh shit!
                KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them.

                OFFICER BRUCKS is speaking into his POLICE RADIO.

                                    OFFICER BRUCKS
                       I found them. And I'm gonna need back-up.

          129   EXT. CHERRY HILL ROAD                                       129
                The COP CAR is tailing the Jeep. The Jeep pulls away...

                              (into police radio)
                       Oh boy! We got a chase on our hands!

                HAROLD looks determined as he puts the pedal to the metal.

                                    KUMAR
                       What are you doing?!

                       I'm not going back to jail!     We've come
                       too far! Now buckle up.

                Kumar buckles his seat belt.   HAROLD MAKES A SHARP TURN...

          132   EXT. CHERRY HILL ROAD                                      132
                The YELLOW JEEP goes around a turn in the road and then CUTS

                INTO THE FOREST, DISAPPEARING IN THE WOODS...
                We then see the COP CAR go around the turn. It passes by the
                point where HAROLD and KUMAR entered the forest.

                From OFFICER BRUCKS'S POV, we see that he has a long stretch
                ahead, with no cars in sight.

                                    OFFICER BRUCKS
                       What the hell?
                He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a
                screeching halt.
                OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car and looks around wondering
                where the YELLOW JEEP went. HE THEN HEARS THE SOUND OF

                BRANCHES CRACKING IN THE WOODS...

          134   EXT. WOODS - 6:35 A.M.                                     134
                The Jeep bounces up and down as it heads uphill in the woods.

                Harold is holding onto the wheel for dear life. Kumar is
                scared as shit. They're both bouncing up and down.

                                    KUMAR
                       Where the hell are we going?!

                Harold and Kumar are still bouncing up and down...

                                    KUMAR
                       It's a good thing I have an empty
                       stomach, or else I'd puke right now!

                                     HAROLD
                        Don't worry. We're gonna make it.
                        Everything's gonna be...

                THEY NOTICE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE OVER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF.

                            HAROLD                             KUMAR
                Shit!                               Fuck!

                HAROLD HITS THE BRAKES AS HARD AS HE CAN...

          138   EXT. CLIFF - 6:40 AM                                        138
                We see the jeep stop just short of the cliff. Harold and
                Kumar get out of the jeep and walk over to the edge of the
                cliff and look down. IT'S A VERY STEEP DROP.

                SUDDENLY, KUMAR SEES SOMETHING OUT IN THE DISTANCE...

                                    KUMAR
                              (pointing)
                        Rold! Look out there!

                HAROLD LOOKS TO WHERE KUMAR IS POINTING-- IT'S A WHITE CASTLE

                WAY DOWN BELOW, ABOUT A MILE AWAY.

                THEY THEN HEAR A POLICE SIREN COMING FROM BACK IN THE WOODS.

                                      HAROLD
                        Oh shit!   We're trapped!
                Kumar notices something...

                                     KUMAR
                        Not necessarily.
                KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER...

                                     HAROLD
                        No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather
                        turn myself in than die.

                                     KUMAR
                        Dude, it's okay. I used to hang-glide
                        with my dad all the time when I was kid.
                        I know how to do it.

                                     HAROLD
                        You hang-glided? I don't remember that.

                                     KUMAR
                        We did it on our trips   to India. I
                        swear. I know exactly    what I'm doing.
                        I've even done it with   two people at the
                        same time. My brother    and I did it.

                              KUMAR (cont'd)
                 Just hold onto the outside bars and let
                 me take care of the rest.

                              HAROLD
                 No, Kumar. I'm not risking my life over
                 a bunch of hamburgers.
          KUMAR walks over to HAROLD and stares him in the eye...

                              KUMAR
                 You think this just about the burgers,
                 huh? Well, let me tell you-- it's about
                 far more than that.
          KUMAR walks over to the edge of the cliff and looks out onto
          the EARLY MORNING HORIZON. The sun is still rising. The
          scene is very picturesque...

                              KUMAR
                 Our parents came to this country,
                 escaping persecution, poverty, and
                 hunger. Hunger, Harold. They were very,
                 very hungry. And they wanted to live in
                 a land that treated them as equals. A
                 land where their kids could study and get
                 into good colleges. A land filled with
                 hamburger stands. And not just one type
                 of hamburger. Hundreds of types-- with
                 different sizes, toppings, and
                 condiments. That land was America.

          THE POLICE SIREN IS GETTING LOUDER...

                              KUMAR
                        (turning to Rold)
                 You think this is just about the burgers?
                 No. This is about achieving what our
                 parents set out for. This is about the
                 pursuit of happiness. This is about the
                 American dream.
          KUMAR walks over to HAROLD.

                               KUMAR
                 And so we've reached this point. The
                 point which all men eventually have to
                 face. The point of no return.
                        (beat)
                 We can stay here, get arrested and end
                 our hopes of ever going to White Castle.
                 Or we can take the hang-glider and make
                 our leap towards freedom. I leave the
                 decision up to you.
          From the sound of the sirens, it seems that the police are
          getting closer. Harold turns back, facing Kumar...

                                    HAROLD
                       I hate you, Kumar.

                HAROLD AND KUMAR ARE ABOUT FIFTEEN YARDS FROM THE CLIFF,

                HOLDING THE HANG-GLIDER. THE SIRENS ARE GETTING LOUDER...

                                    HAROLD
                       Hurry up...they're almost here!

                                    KUMAR
                       Grab onto the end of the bars and hold on
                       tight.
                HAROLD does as he's told. They are both holding onto the
                bars (Harold behind Kumar).

                                    KUMAR
                       Okay. Here's how this is gonna work. On
                       the count of three, we're gonna run to
                       the edge of the cliff. When I say
                       "jump," launch yourself forward as if you
                       were diving into a pool, got it?

                                    HAROLD
                              (nervous)
                       I think so.

                                    KUMAR
                       Don't worry-- everything's gonna be fine.
                       Are you ready?
                HAROLD's too nervous to speak.   KUMAR gets into position.

                                    KUMAR
                       Okay, here goes. One...two...three!
                HAROLD and KUMAR START RUNNING TOWARDS THE CLIFF.

                                    KUMAR
                       Good job, Rold! Keep running!

                THEY'RE GETTING CLOSER...

                                    KUMAR
                       Rold, there's something I gotta tell you.
                       I've never hang-glided before.

                                    HAROLD

                       WHAT???

                                    KUMAR

                       JUMP!!!

                HAROLD AND KUMAR JUMP OFF, JUST AS THE COP CAR ARRIVES.

                 The hang glider coasts through the air for a couple seconds.

                 THEN, SUDDENLY, THE GUYS START GOING DOWN AT A SHARP ANGLE!

                             HAROLD                            KUMAR

                 AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!                   AHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

                 JUST THEN, THE HANG GLIDER CATCHES ONTO THE WIND AND STARTS

                 GLIDING THROUGH THE SKY.

                                       HAROLD
                        Oh my God!    Oh my God!   Oh my God!

                                     KUMAR
                        Dude, it's working!

                                     HAROLD
                        I can't believe you lied to me!

                                     KUMAR
                        Hey, how else was I gonna convince you to
                        jump off a cliff?

                 OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car, holding his rifle and
                 runs over to the jeep. He looks inside...

                                     OFFICER BRUCKS
                               (to the walkie-talkie)
                        It appears they've escaped. They ditched
                        their jeep.
                 OFFICER BRUCKS opens the front door of the car and peers
                 inside. He notices THE BAG OF WEED ON THE DASHBOARD. He
                 opens it and TASTES SOME WEED in the same way a drug cop
                 would taste cocaine during a bust.

                                     OFFICER BRUCKS
                               (to the walkie-talkie)
                        Good news. I found enough dope in the
                        car to send those skateboard punks to
                        jail for the next couple years. Looks
                        like they've terrorized their last
                        convenience store.
                 Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth
                 is strangely appealing. He thinks for a beat as he eyes the
                 bag of weed. He then takes another taste of it. He looks
                 again at the bag. Like Kumar, we can tell that he's in
                 love...

                 BRUCKS is skeet shooting, as the BAG OF WEED watches.      Brucks
                 gives the bag a kiss, after a successful round.

                 "ass" as he goes.

                 Our triumphant heros are gliding across the morning sky.
                 Harold and Kumar look down as they soar above the trees...

                                     HAROLD
                        Dude, we're so high right now.

                                     KUMAR
                        We're not low.
                 They continue gliding though the sky for a while...

                                       HAROLD
                        Hey, Kumar?

                                       KUMAR
                        Yeah?

                                     HAROLD
                        How are we gonna get down?

                                     KUMAR
                        Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go
                        down at some point.

                                     HAROLD
                        That's a great answer. Made me feel
                        really comfortable. Thanks a lot.
                 KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground.

                                     HAROLD
                        Is it a problem if we fly into birds?

                                     KUMAR
                        Why do you ask?

                              HAROLD
                 Because we're about to!
          KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING

          STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM.

                               KUMAR
                 Oh shit!
          HAROLD AND KUMAR FLY RIGHT INTO THE CROWS.   Numerous birds
          collide with their faces...

                               HAROLD
                 Ahhhh!   My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes!

          THE BIRDS CAUSE THE HANG-GLIDER TO GO AGAINST THE WIND,

          SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR DOWN FAST. THEY ARE SCREAMING AND

          YELLING AS THEY PLUMMET...

                              KUMAR
                 We're gonna die! We're gonna die!

                               HAROLD
                 I hate you!   I hate you so much!

          THE HANG-GLIDER FALLS STRAIGHT INTO A TREE AND GETS CAUGHT IN

          THE BRANCHES. THEY APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN SAVED.

                               KUMAR

                 live!
                        (beat)
                 You see, Rold? That wasn't so bad.

          SNAP!!! THE BRANCH BREAKS OFF, SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR

          STRAIGHT DOWN. THEY FALL ABOUT THIRTY FEET, THUMPING ON

          BRANCHES AS THEY FALL...

          SMACK!!! THEY HIT THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY START ROLLING

          DOWN A HILL. THEY CONTINUE ROLLING...ROLLING...ROLLING...

          FINALLY-- THEY STOP ROLLING WHEN THEY HIT HARD PAVEMENT.
          HAROLD gets up before he can catch his breath...

                              HAROLD
                        (breathing heavily)
                 That's it...I'm gonna kill you...

          HAROLD GRABS KUMAR BY THE NECK AND STARTS CHOKING HIM!

                              KUMAR
                 Stop...I...can't...breathe...

                              HAROLD
                 That's the point!

                HAROLD CONTINUES STRANGLING KUMAR, WHO NOTICES SOMETHING...

                                      KUMAR
                       Rold...

                              (pointing)
                       Rold...look!

                HAROLD TURNS AROUND. HE RELEASES KUMAR FROM HIS GRIP. KUMAR

                STARTS CATCHING HIS BREATH. HAROLD STANDS UP. SOON AFTER,

                KUMAR STANDS UP. KUMAR THEN PUTS HIS ARM AROUND HAROLD...

                                    KUMAR
                       We made it, dude.

                FROM HAROLD AND KUMAR'S POV, WE SEE THE WHITE CASTLE IN FRONT

                OF THEM. THEY ARE STANDING IN THE PARKING LOT. HAROLD AND

                KUMAR SLOWLY WALK OVER TO THE ENTRANCE.

                THEY BOTH LOOK AT EACH OTHER-- THEY'RE TOO HAPPY TO SMILE,

                BUT THEIR EYES SAY IT ALL. THEY ENTER THE RESTAURANT...

          142   INT. WHITE CASTLE - 7:00 AM                                  142
                Harold and Kumar walk inside. Their shirts are torn and
                tattered, their bodies are scratched up, and they're covered
                in dirt. Everyone in the restaurant turns and stares at them.
                They approach the counter, where A TEENAGER STANDING...

                                    TEENAGER
                       Looks like you guys had some night, huh?
                Harold and Kumar look at each other, and then back at the
                teenager. Their expressions are stone cold...

                                    HAROLD
                       I want thirty slyders. I want five french
                       fries. I want four large Cherry cokes.

                                      KUMAR
                       Same.    Only make mine Diet Cokes.

                                    TEENAGER
                       Wow. That comes to...forty-two dollars
                       and seventy-five cents.
                HAROLD and KUMAR take out their WALLETS.     THEY OPEN THEM UP.

                THE WALLETS ARE EMPTY!

                                    HAROLD
                       Hey...hey...hey...where's my money?!

                              KUMAR
                 You don't have money?! Shit, I gave all
                 mine to that asshole at Princeton! Fuck
                 that hippie fuck! This can't be
                 happening! We're so close and we're
                 fucking broke!

                              MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                 Let me take care of it.
          HAROLD and KUMAR turn around and see NEIL PATRICK HARRIS
          finishing his coke. He throws it in the trash. HAROLD and
          KUMAR are stunned.

                              KUMAR
                 What are you doing here?

                              NEIL
                 You guys kept talking about White Castle
                 last night. It made me start craving it
                 too.

                              HAROLD
                 Where's my fucking car you prick!

                              NEIL
                 Yeah. Sorry about that. Like I said, I
                 was tripping balls last night. I don't
                 know what came over me. Your car's out
                 in the parking lot. Here are the keys.
          NEIL tosses HAROLD the car keys.

                              KUMAR
                 Do you realize what we had to go through
                 after you stole the car?

                              NEIL
                 I know. It was a dick move on my part.
                 That's why I'm paying for your meal.
          Harold and Kumar look at each other, relieved.

                              HAROLD
                 Thanks, I guess.
          NEIL hands them some cash...

                              NEIL
                 Here's fifty for the meal, and two
                 hundred for the car.

                              HAROLD
                        (concerned)
                 What happened to the car?

                              NEIL
                 I made some love stains in the back seat.
                 You'll see. Anyway, take it easy guys.
                 I'll see you around.

                              HAROLD
                 Where are you going?

                              NEIL
                 Wherever God takes me.
          With that, NEIL walks out of the restaurant.   HAROLD and
          KUMAR look at each other, confused.

                              TEENAGER
                 Hey guys...it's gonna take a little while
                 to make all those burgers. You might as
                 well sit down.
          HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to a booth and take a seat.

                              KUMAR
                 Dude, we're here. Isn't it great?

                              HAROLD
                 I know. I can't believe we made it. AND
                 we got the car back! If we can just get
                 out of here in a half hour, I can get
                 back to my office and get the work done.

                               KUMAR
                 Hey, look!
          KUMAR points to a TV in the corner of the restaurant.    On the
          screen we see A MORNING NEWS SHOW.

          ON THE TELEVISION:

                 Banks are suing the state of New Jersey

                 What happened last night was a complete
                 moral travesty. My family and I are
                 outraged and will not settle for anything
                 less than justice...

                 I'm not racist! This is bullshit! If
                 those black bastards think they're gonna
                 get away with this, they've got another
                 thing coming! Me and my white buddies
                 are gonna [bleep] them up!
          Officer Palumbo gets shoved forcefully into the back of a

                their own orders and realize how worthless they are.                
                HAROLD and KUMAR are sitting across from one another, looking
                at the smorgasbord in front of them. HAROLD IS ABOUT TO DIG

                HAROLD and KUMAR have finished their meals. They both look
                full and satisfied. Harold takes one last sip of his soda.

                                    HAROLD
                       Oh...that hit the spot.

                                    KUMAR
                       It was the best meal of my life.

                                    HAROLD
                       Mine too.
                The two of them sit there, looking at all the empty
                containers and wrappers. After a long pause of silence,
                KUMAR speaks...

                       Dude, you know what? I think I may
                       actually go to my interview today.

                                    HAROLD
                       Seriously?

                                    KUMAR
                       Yeah. You know, my whole life I've been
                       afraid being just another nerdy Indian
                       guy turned doctor. Well, tonight got me
                       thinking...

                SUDDENLY, HAROLD NOTICES A CONVERTIBLE PARKING OUTSIDE THE

                RESTAURANT-- IT'S BILLY AND J.D. WITH TWO WOMEN.

                                    KUMAR
                       There are far worse things in the world
                       than being tagged for having a natural
                       ability in medicine...
                HAROLD pretends to be listening to KUMAR-- BUT HE IS MORE
                FOCUSED ON BILLY AND J.D., who get out of the car with their
                women and start walking towards the front door.

                                    KUMAR
                       Like having boils all over your face. Or
                       dealing with the shit those black guys
                       had to go through.

                              KUMAR
                 Besides, I have to admit, it felt pretty
                 cool saving that guy's life last night.
                 Somewhere between that, getting yelled at
                 by my dad, and seeing Neil Patrick
                 Harris, I realized that I've always
                 wanted to be a doctor-- I've just been
                 too scared to admit it.
          KUMAR sees that HAROLD isn't paying attention...

                              KUMAR
                 Hey, Rold, are you listening to me?   I'm
                 having a major epiphany here.

                              HAROLD
                 I'll be right back...
          At that moment, BILLY and J.D. walk in the restaurant with
          their women, ZOE and TRACY, respectively. TRACY looks like
          some bimbo slut that J.D. picked up at a strip club. ZOE, On
          the other hand, has a sweet RENEE ZELLWEGER quality about
          her. She and Billy are the perfect Hollywood couple...

                              J.D.
                 Hey, Billy-- you paying for this or what?

                              BILLY
                 I'll be there in a second...
          J.D. and TRACY check out the menu. BILLY takes ZOE aside--
          whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you
          complete me" moment...

                              BILLY
                 Look, I have to admit something to you.
                 At the start of last night, all I really
                 cared about was getting some. But then I
                 met you, Zoe. You're so different from
                 all the other women I've ever met.
                 You're smart, funny, artistic. I guess
                 what I'm trying to say is...

                              HAROLD (O.S.)
                 What the fuck is going on here?
          BILLY turns around and sees HAROLD...

                               BILLY
                 Harold?   What are you...?

                              HAROLD
                 Never mind me. What are you doing here?
                 I thought you and J.D. were busy all
                 night with "clients." Isn't that why I
                 had to do YOUR work?

          J.D. hears the commotion and turns around...

                              J.D.
                 Hey! What the hell is going on here?

                              HAROLD
                 Back off, cock boy! What I have to say
                 to him goes double for you!
          KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it.

                              J.D.
                 Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just
                 call me "cock boy?"

                              HAROLD
                 Yeah, you know I did. You're just
                 stalling because you're not quick enough
                 to think of a comeback.

                               J.D.
                 Oh, I'm not quick enough?
                        (to Billy)
                 He thinks I'm not quick enough.
                        (to Harold)
                 Well, I got news for you...
                        (long beat, thinking)
                 I am quick enough...
                        (beat)
                 ...cock boy!
          J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation.

                              BILLY
                 Listen Harry...

                              J.D.
                        (to Billy)
                 Don't even bother with him.   We'll just
                 tell Berenson later...

                              HAROLD
                 Tell him what? That I'm your work horse!
                 That you guys think you can just party
                 all weekend and leave all your work to
                 the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh?
          J.D. is stunned.   Now he's a little nervous.

                              J.D.
                 No, no-- you don't understand...

                              HAROLD
                 No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing
                 your work anymore.

                       And if either one of you douchebags ever
                       tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to
                       Berenson and tell him what's really going
                       on.
                Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening...

                                    HAROLD
                       And I'll tell everyone in the office how
                       you both caught gonorrhea from that
                       whore.
                TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out.   They slowly
                back away from BILLY and J.D....

                                    HAROLD
                       Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get
                       going. See you on Monday.
                HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows.     Billy and J.D.
                are left embarrassed and in shock.

                HAROLD and KUMAR walk over to Harold's Infiniti...

                                    KUMAR
                       Way to go, Rold! Where the hell did that
                       come from?

                                    HAROLD
                       I don't know. Eating those delicious
                       burgers made me feel like a new man. Now
                       I'm actually looking forward to work this
                       week.

                                    KUMAR
                       No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after
                       all.

                                    HAROLD
                       I'm not worthless.

                                    KUMAR
                       So those dudes have gonorrhea?

                                     HAROLD
                       Beats me.
                              (beat)
                       Now, come on, let's get going.

                                    KUMAR
                       What's the rush? There's plenty of time
                       before my interview.

                                    HAROLD
                       I have some unfinished business to take
                       care of.
                They both get into the car (Harold gets in the driver's
                side). The car zooms out...

                The elevator doors open. Harold and Kumar exit. Kumar gives
                Harold a pat on the back...

                                    KUMAR
                       Good luck, dude.
                KUMAR stands behind, while HAROLD approaches MARIA'S door.

                HAROLD TAKES A DEEP BREATH AND THEN KNOCKS ON THE DOOR...

                THERE IS TENSION AS HAROLD WAITS. THEN, FINALLY, THE DOOR

                KNOB BEGINS TO TURN AND THE DOOR OPENS--

                A GOOD-LOOKING, MUSCULAR HISPANIC MAN (LUIS) IS STANDING

                BEHIND THE DOOR WEARING ONLY HIS BOXERS. HE HAS LIPSTICK ALL

                OVER HIS NECK AND CHEST...

                                    LUIS
                       What do you want?

                A LOOK OF EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT GOES OVER HAROLD'S FACE.

                 She seemed so sweet at first, but it
                 turns out she's into some pretty freaky
                 shit. She even did this thing where she
                 took a lollipop and shoved it...

                              HAROLD
                        (grossed out/depressed)

                 interrupting you guys...
          Harold starts to walk away, almost crying. SAD, DEPRESSING
          MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY. Kumar feels sorry for his friend.
          Just then, Luis leans his head out the door...

                              LUIS
                 Hey-- if you're looking for Maria, she
                 left for Europe this morning.
          Harold quickly turns around and runs back over.

                               HAROLD
                 Huh?

                              LUIS
                 She's going to Amsterdam for ten days.
                 I'm Luis -- Maria's brother.
          Luis shakes Harold's hand.    Harold suddenly feels better.

                                HAROLD
                 Oh!    Maria's brother!

                              LUIS
                 You must be that Chinese guy Maria keeps
                 talking about.

                              HAROLD
                 Actually, I'm Kor...wait a second-- she
                 talks about me?
          A HOT BLACK CHICK (AISHA), wearing only a bra and g-string,
          walks over to Luis and wraps her arms around him...

                              AISHA
                 Are you coming or what?

                              LUIS
                 Hey, I'll be there in a second, baby. Do
                 me a favor-- make me that omelette you
                 were talking about. You know, with the
                 sun-dried tomatoes.
          Aisha kisses him, and walks away to the kitchen. Luis gives
          her a little a slap on the ass. Harold doesn't quite know
          how to respond to this.

                 Uh, no thanks. I'd rather do it in
                 person.

                 Then take it easy, hermano.
          Luis shuts the door.    Kumar runs over to Harold...

                 Dude...we gotta go!

                 Huh?   Where?

                              KUMAR
                 To Amsterdam! We can pack up right now
                 and take the next plane.

                              HAROLD
                 What are you talking about? Are you out
                 of your mind? What about your interview
                 with the med school guy?

                              KUMAR
                 Whatever. I'll tell my dad to reschedule
                 it. He won't have a problem, as long as
                 I'm taking it seriously for a change.
                 Now, let's fly to Europe and find Maria!

                              HAROLD
                 She's coming back in ten days! It's not
                 like I'm never gonna see her again.

                              KUMAR
                 For a hot chick, ten days in Europe is
                 the kiss of death. There are gonna be
                 suave, sophisticated guys all over her.
                 By the time she gets back, she may not be
                 available.
          Harold feels a little nervous about what Kumar is saying.

                               HAROLD
                 Forget it.   I'll just wait till she comes
                 back.
          Harold starts to walk away from Kumar...

          EXT. PARK - DAY


          
          We float down through a serene, leafy park to the
          children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL
          FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.

          

                                 GIGI (V.O.)
                    I have a theory about how this all
                    started...

          
          A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little
          girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.

          
          And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE

          LITTLE GIRL DOWN.

          

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                    Why did you do that?

          

                                 LITTLE BOY
                    Because you smell like dog poo.

          
          Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one-
          liner. Our little girl's face turns red.

          

                                 LITTLE BOY (CONT'D)
                    You're so stupid just like dog poo!
                    You're made of poo!

          
          And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE,
          smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.

          

          INT. KITCHEN - DAY


          
          Our beautiful girl sits at a kitchen table with her MOM.
          She can only get out one syllable between big, wet sobs.

          

                                  LITTLE GIRL
                    Made. (SOB)   Of. (SOB)   Dog. (SOB)   Poo.

          

                                 MOM
                    Honey, do you know why that little boy
                    did those things? And said those things?

          
          The little girl shakes her head no.

          

                                 MOM (CONT'D)
                    Because he LIKES YOU.

          

          FREEZE FRAME ON OUR LITTLE GIRL'S FACE - TRYING TO

          PROCESS THIS.

                                 GIGI (V.O.)
                    Uh - excuse me -- but what - the - HELL?
                    Where did that rumor start? Because moms
                    have been spreading it for years.

          

          BACK TO THE SCENE - THE MOM CONTINUES...

          

                                 MOM
                    That little boy is doing those terrible
                    things because he HAS A CRUSH ON YOU.

          
          We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now
          beginning to understand the ways of the world.

          

                                 GIGI (V.O.)
                    Do you understand what this means? We
                    are all encouraged to believe that if a
                    guy acts like a total jerk -- that means
                    he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that
                    might serve us as five year olds, but
                    many of us keep believing this advice
                    well into adulthood.

          

          INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT


          
          A CUTE COLLEGE GIRL sits CRYING in front of her ANSWERING
          MACHINE, as her ROOMMATE looks on.

          

                                 GIGI (V.O.)
                    Then, as we get older, we carry on this
                    tradition of misreading the signals men
                    send by encouraging our friends to do the
                    same...

          
          The machine evilly flashes 0 in the NEW MESSAGES window.

          

                                 ROOMMATE #1
                    That Phi Delt so obviously liked you.
                    I'm sure he just lost your number.

          

          INT. HIGH RISE OFFICE - DAY


          
          A HOT EXECUTIVE WOMAN stands in the office hallway,
          watching a SEXY MALE COLLEAGUE walk by. He does not give
          her a second glance. Her FEMALE SECRETARY looks on.

          

                                 SECRETARY
                    He's not asking you out because he's
                    intimidated by your professional success
                    and emotional maturity.

          INT. BAR - NIGHT


          
          A BUNCH OF TWENTY-SOMETHINGS sipping cocktails. One of
          them is CRYING - smeared mascara, puffy eyes, etc.

          

                                 CUTE TWENTYSOMETHING #1
                    Here's the problem. He likes you TOO
                    much. You're TOO pretty and awesome.        He
                    can't handle it.

          

          INT. BURGER KING - DAY


          

          TWO FEMALE CASHIERS WORK SIDE BY SIDE.

          

                                 CASHIER #1
                    Trust me. It's because he's just getting
                    out of a serious relationship.

          

          INT. GYM - DAY


          
          TWO MIDDLE AGED WOMEN work out on ellipticals.

          

                                 MIDDLE AGED WOMAN #1
                    Trust me. It's because he's never had a
                    serious relationship.

          

          INT. JAPANESE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY


          
          TWO HIPSTER JAPANESE GIRLS making their way through a
          crowded Tokyo department store.

          

                                 TOKYO GIRL #1 (SUBTITLE)
                    Shigeru's inability to commit clearly
                    stems from his failure to properly
                    imprint on his mother during breast
                    feeding.

          

          EXT. FRENCH POLYNESIA - DAY


          
          A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN weaves BANANA LEAVES with a FRIEND.

          

                                 FRIEND (SUBTITLE)
                    I'm sure he forgot your hut number.    Or
                    didn't get enough approval from his
                    father. Or was eaten by a giraffe.

          
          This last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman.

          

                                 GIGI (V.O.)
                    Why do we say this stuff to each other?
                    Why do we tell each other these lies?

                                 (MORE)

                                 GIGI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                    Is it possible that it's because we're
                    too scared, and it's too hard, to say the
                    one obvious truth that's staring everyone
                    in the face?

          

          THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.    AND THEN THE TITLE FADES UP:

          

                          HE'S JUST NOT THAT INTO YOU...

          

          INT. BREWER'S ART - NIGHT


          
          GIGI, pretty and approachable, sits in a booth at a hip
          Mt. Vernon date spot with CONOR, cute but holding onto
          his frat boy roots. They sip their near empty cocktails.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So, Janine told me you're a real estate
                    agent.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Yeah. But don't worry - not one of the
                    cheesy ones who puts his headshot on bus
                    benches and grocery carts.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So just like on frisbees and notepads?

          
          Conor laughs.    Gigi smiles -- she's doing well.

          

                                   CONOR
                    You got it.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Much classier.

          

                                 CONOR
                    My thoughts exactly.

          
          Gigi sips her drink, and looks at Conor.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I wonder why Janine never thought of
                    introducing us before?

          

                                 CONOR
                    Yeah, I don't know, I ummm -

          
          Their WAITRESS appears, cutting him off.

          

                                 WAITRESS
                    You guys ready for another round?

          
          Conor looks to Gigi.

                                 CONOR
                    You want one more?

          

                                 GIGI
                    Only if you do. But I mean, if you have
                    to get going I totally ...

          
          Gigi trails off. Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT.
          We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome
          of this date hangs in the balance. It's an eternity.

          

                                    CONOR
                    Umm.    OK.   Sure. One more.

          
          Gigi breathes a SIGH of relief.

          

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                    You had Ketel and soda, right?

          
          Gigi NODS and SMILES, clearly flattered that Conor
          remembered her order. She scoots a little closer to him.

          

          EXT. BREWER'S ART - NIGHT


          
          Gigi and Conor HUG outside the restaurant.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Well, Conor, I had a really nice time.

          

                                   CONOR
                    Yeah.    It was really nice meeting you.

          

                                   GIGI
                    B-bye.

          
          Gigi waves flirtatiously and walks away, smiling.

          
          She turns around to look, and sees Conor TAKE HIS CELL

          PHONE OUT OF HIS POCKET.

          
          Gigi TAKES HER CELL OUT OF HER PURSE and dials.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Hey, it's me. He's cute. I think it
                    went well.

          
          She sneaks another look over her shoulder to see Conor.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    And I think he might me leaving me a
                    message at home as - we - speak.

          SLIDES OVER TO FIND:

          
          CONOR - also in FREEZE FRAME. The image UNFREEZES and we
          continue with Conor as he DIALS HIS CELL PHONE.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know
                    that I was thinking about you.

          

          INT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK GROCERY - SAME


          
          ANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle.
          She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER
          and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Conor, that's so nice.     Thank you.

          
          As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of
          her. He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking
          and supremely likeable. They share a smile.

          

                                 BEN
                    Do you want to go ahead?

          

                                 ANNA
                    Hmm?

          

                                  BEN
                    Go ahead?   You've only got two things.

          

                                 ANNA
                           (into phone)
                    Hold on.

          
          She looks at what he's got - a SIX PACK OF SIERRA NEVADA.

          

                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                    You've only got one thing.

          

                                 BEN
                    Well, technically it's six. And I'm
                    still mulling over a gum purchase. So...

          
          He steps aside to let her go.   She smiles.

          

                                 ANNA
                           (into phone)
                    Hey, let me call you right back.

          She hangs up the phone and moves past Ben, hands her
          things to the EMOTIONLESS CASHIER. As he rings them up -
          she looks back at Ben - they SHARE ANOTHER LOOK.

          
          She hands the cashier her ATM card - he swipes it.

          

                                   EMOTIONLESS CASHIER
                    Oh my word.

          

                                ANNA
                    Come on. Seriously. I just deposited
                    money today. There's no way -

          

                                 EMOTIONLESS CASHIER
                    It's not that. Let me check something.

          
          He turns and rifles through a stack of papers, finally
          finding what he was looking for.

          

                                 EMOTIONLESS CASHIER

                                 (CONT'D)
                    Congratulations. You won.

          

                                   ANNA
                    What?

          

                                 EMOTIONLESS CASHIER
                    Our "Sizzlin' Summer" promotion.     You're
                    our 1000th customer in June.

          
          The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an
          IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna. She BEAMS.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Are you kidding?

          

                                 EMOTIONLESS CASHIER
                    Do I have that kind of manner? A joking
                    manner?

          
          Anna looks to Ben.   She looks like she's about to burst.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I swear to god, this is the most exciting
                    thing that's ever happened to me.

          
          Ben can't tell if she's kidding.

          

                                   BEN
                    Really?

          

                                   ANNA
                    Is that sad?

                                 BEN
                    No, it's - charming.     Congratulations.

          
          Anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler.    Then -

          

                                ANNA
                    Wait, no. I can't accept this. You were
                    here first. I didn't win at all.

          

                                 BEN
                    Yes, you did. Trust me - it's fate.      You
                    were meant to have that cooler.

          
          Anna throws her arms around him and hugs him.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Thank you SO MUCH.

          
          Ben can't help but laugh.

          

          INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT


          
          Conor enters his apartment.     ALEX sits on the couch
          watching TV.

          

                                   ALEX
                    Hey.    How was the date?

          

                                  CONOR
                    Fine.   You know.

          
          Conor heads for the kitchen, and turns back.

          

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                    Why are you here?

          

                                 ALEX
                    My cable's out.

          
          Conor returns from the kitchen with a beer.

          

                                 CONOR
                    You didn't hear the phone ring, did you?

          

                                  ALEX
                    Nope.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Shit. Anna gave me the "I'll call you
                    right back."

          

                                 ALEX
                    How long ago?

                      22 minutes.

          
          Alex winces.

          

                                     ALEX
                      Sorry, dude.

          

                                   CONOR
                      Do I call back?

          
          Alex shrugs.

          

                                   CONOR (CONT'D)
                      I know. I'll call back and say that I'm
                      going to bed.

          

                                     ALEX
                      At 9:30 PM?    Genius.

          

                                   CONOR
                      It is genius. Because then I can say:
                      "In case you were going to call me back -
                      don't - 'cause I'll be sleeping."

          

                                   ALEX
                      Sounds foolproof.

          
          Conor pulls off his jacket and tosses it next to a box -
          which contains about 50 FRISBEES. On each frisbee:

          

          A LARGE PICTURE OF CONOR, WITH HIS PHONE NUMBER AND THE

          TITLE: CONOR BARRY REAL ESTATE AGENT

          
          Conor dials his cell phone as he heads back to his room.

          

                                                                  CUT TO:

          

          CLOSE ON:   A CELL PHONE.    IT READS "CONOR CALLING"

          We TILT up to find Anna and Ben. Anna looks at her
          phone, presses IGNORE and stashes it in her purse.

          

                                    ANNA
                      Sorry.   What was I saying?

          

                                   BEN
                      I think you were telling me how you don't
                      want to be like your mom and wake up and
                      realize you didn't pursue your dreams.

          Ben opens his GUM and offers Anna a piece.     She takes one
          and laughs, a bit embarrassed.

          

                                ANNA
                    Was I? Little intense for grocery store
                    chatter. Sorry.

          

                                 BEN
                    It's OK. I might even be able to help
                    you out. There's a guy at my firm who
                    has exclusively music clients.

          

                                 ANNA
                    That would be - amazing.      What are you -
                    like my savior?

          
          Anna digs through her purse to find a piece of paper.
          She writes down her number, and holds it out to him. He
          looks at it, contemplating. He doesn't take it.

          

                                    BEN
                    OK. Look.      I'm married.   I don't do
                    this.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Don't do what? Help struggling singers?

          

                                 BEN
                    Help hot Pilates instructing singers who
                    happen to be very charming.

          
          Anna takes the slip of paper and puts it away.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Do you want to give me your card? That's
                    legit. I bet you're allowed to do that.

          
          Ben considers this.

          

                                   BEN
                    Right.   OK.   I guess that would be OK.

          

          FROM INSIDE A CAR PARKED AT THE STORE:

          
          We see Anna and Ben talking.     They shake hands awkwardly
          and Ben HEADS TOWARDS US.

          

          INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS


          
          Ben gets in the car, bag in hand, and joins NEIL, 40,
          arty and kind looking, who's behind the wheel.

                                 NEIL
                    So, who was that?

          

                                 BEN
                    A prospective client.

          

                                  NEIL
                    Yeah right.

          

                                 BEN
                    I can talk to a woman Neil.        It doesn't
                    have to be like that.

          
          Neil looks at him, smirk growing.

          

                                  BEN (CONT'D)
                    Just drive.

          
          Neil starts the car and they pull away.

          

          INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - NIGHT


          
          Neil walks into a vast space. Nice art, a cozy yet
          architectural look - a cool place to live.

          

                                   NEIL
                    Hey, babe.    You here?

          
          We PAN over to a couch - where BETH is wrapped in a throw
          blanket, watching TV. She's got her hair in a messy bun.

          

                                  BETH
                    Hey honey.

          
          He joins her on the couch.        And sees that the TV is off.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Everything OK?

          

                                  BETH
                    Yeah.   Just got off the phone.

          
          Neil gets up again.

          

                                 NEIL
                    You want some tea or something?

          

                                 BETH
                    It was my baby sister.        She's getting
                    married.

                                 NEIL
                    That's great. I've always liked that
                    Devon guy. That's really great.

          
          Beth looks at him.    She doesn't look that happy.

          

                                 BETH
                    Do you think it's great?

          

                                   NEIL
                    Yeah.

          

                                 BETH
                    So, you think it's great that they're
                    getting married, but you never feel like
                    we're going against nature or something
                    by not getting married?

          

                                   NEIL
                    No, babe.

          
          He sits back down, puts his arms around her.

          

                                 NEIL (CONT'D)
                    Going against nature is like that cat who
                    started nursing that monkey. We're just
                    two people who aren't married.

          
          Beth manages a weak smile.

          

                                   BETH
                    Right.

          

                                 NEIL
                    I actually think the odds of having a
                    successful relationship increase by not
                    getting married. Look at my parents -
                    all marriage got them was thirty two
                    years of misery and joint checking.

          

                                 BETH
                    Yeah, I know. I get that.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Like I've always told you - I love you -
                    and we don't need a marriage certificate
                    to legitimize our relationship.

          

                                   BETH
                    Yeah.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Lemme get you some tea.

          

          

                                       12

          

          7/20/7                                                 13.

          

          

          
          He exits. Beth starts to CRY, but quickly dries her
          tears, and forces herself to pull it together.

          

          EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING


          
          A brick row house in an up and coming neighborhood -
          clearly under massive renovation.

          

          INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME


          
          We make our way through rooms with plastic covering the
          doorways - until we find JANINE stepping into the
          hallway. She checks herself in a vintage mirror,
          straightens it a tad, then heads down the stairs to find
          GIGI, on her cell phone. Gigi slams it closed.

          

                                 JANINE
                    OK, so clearly he hasn't called.

          
          Gigi shakes her head.

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Maybe he's away on business.

          

                                 GIGI
                    He sells real estate. In Baltimore.
                    Staying in town is his business.

          

                                    JANINE
                    Right.

          
          Janine ponders this.

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Look, let me tell you - after the first
                    time I went out with Ben, he didn't call
                    me for eleven days. ELEVEN DAYS. And
                    now he's like the world's best husband.
                    That happens all the time.

          

                                    GIGI
                    Really?

          

                                    JANINE
                    Yes, really.

          
          Gigi manages a small smile.

          

                                 GIGI
                    This is all your fault.

          

                                    JANINE
                    What?    Why?

          

          

                                      13

          

          7/20/7                                                   14.

          

          

          

                                 GIGI
                    You set me up with him.

          

                                 JANINE
                    No - you asked if I knew any guys and I
                    gave Conor your number. That's not a set
                    up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros
                    and cons. I do my due diligence. All I
                    know about Conor is he sold us this
                    house.

          
          Gigi peers out the window.

          

                                 GIGI
                    He sold you a house in the ghetto.

          

                                 JANINE
                    It's a neighborhood "in transition."

          
          Gigi makes a move for the phone, Janine stops her.

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Seriously, stop.

          

                                 GIGI
                    He said he always hangs at Red Maple
                    after work. Maybe I should do a little
                    drive-by?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Please, don't. He'll call.

          
          Off Gigi - panic seeping in.

          

          FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S NOT CALLING YOU

          
          AMBER, pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in
          the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes.

          

                                 AMBER
                    Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever
                    happened to me. Total invasion of my
                    personal freedom. When a guy doesn't
                    call me, it is my right - my duty even -
                    to call him and hang up several thousand
                    times. Or at least until his mother
                    shouts at me in Albanian and blows a
                    police whistle into the phone. I mean,
                    calling and hanging up is an age old
                    expression of love and frustration and
                    too many wine coolers - and who is AT&
                    f'ing T to take that away from me?

                                 AMBER (CONT'D)
                    Next thing you know, someone is going to
                    ban me from sitting in my car in front of
                    a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your
                    Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new
                    stupid girlfriend comes outside and
                    threatens to scratch my eyes out with her
                    acrylics. I mean, a girl deserves
                    freedom of expression, right?

          

          INT. GYM - DAY


          
          Pilates class. We pan down the row of mats, STUDENTS
          obediently doing The Mermaid. We finally land on Gigi's
          mat: Gigi manages to twist herself into a passable
          Mermaid - as her CELL PHONE lies in full view on her mat.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT


          
          Shower is on, curtain pulled. A CELL PHONE RINGS. An
          ARM SHOOTS out of the shower and grabs it from the sink.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Mom, I gotta call you back.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT


          
          Gigi lays in bed, her CELL PHONE right next to her head.
          One eye POPS OPEN, checks the phone, and closes again.

          

          INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY


          
          A typical, corporate style office. Walled off cubicles
          for the junior execs, outer offices for management.

          
          Gigi is in her cubicle. Janine, her friend and, we now
          learn, co-worker, sits on Gigi's desk.

          

                                 JANINE
                    So, this was at the end of the date, or
                    at the beginning?

          

                                  GIGI
                    End.   Why - does it matter?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning
                    of the date is normal. "Nice meeting
                    you" at the end could be a blow off.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Maybe it was at the beginning.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Then that's fine. He's gonna call.

          

          

                                    15

          

          7/20/7                                                   16.

          

          

          

                                 GIGI
                    Or maybe it was at the end.   Or maybe it
                    was nice to meet me.

                                 JANINE
                    Wait - was it "nice meeting you" or "nice
                    to meet you"?

                                  GIGI
                    Shit.   I can't remember.

          

                                 JANINE
                    "Nice to meet you" is OK. "Nice meeting
                    you" is like "Do you want your receipt in
                    the bag?"

          
          The girls look up to find BETH standing there, listening.

          

                                 BETH
                    Remember the days when you guys at least
                    pretended to be working when I came in?

          
          Beth heads to her office.   Janine and Gigi follow.

          

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                    Janine, how's the press release?

          
          Janine, clearly organized, flips open her notebook:

          

                                 JANINE
                    Beckon the baking to begin! McCormick,
                    the flavor expert, introduces five fun
                    filled flavors that will definitely
                    delight dessert divas!

          
          Gigi stifles a laugh.

          

                                 BETH
                    Maybe a shade heavy on the alliteration -
                    but otherwise good.
                           (to Gigi)
                    Where are we with the company newsletter?

          

                                 GIGI
                    I am so almost done with that. It's just
                    been a little hard to focus on my article
                    about the two sets of twins in market
                    research, when the guy - who may or may
                    not be the guy of my dreams - refuses to
                    call me.

          
          Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.

                                 BETH
                    Look, after my first date with Neil, I
                    called him. There are no rules anymore.
                    Why should you have to wait for him to
                    get off his ass?

          

          INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY


          
          Gigi sits at her desk, Janine standing by her side.
          She's got a few sheets of paper on her desk.

          
          Gigi takes a deep breath, picks up the office phone and
          dials. Janine gives her a thumbs up.

          

                                 GIGI
                    It's ringing.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Pretty standard.

          

                                  GIGI
                            (listening to receiver)
                    Yes!   Voicemail.

          

                                  JANINE
                    Your notes.

          
          Gigi nods - it's all under control.

          

                                 GIGI
                           (reading off her paper)
                    Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought,
                    I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how
                    stupid is it that a gal has got to wait
                    for a guy's call anyway, right?

          
          Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she
          seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing -
          "What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                           (clearly ad-libbing)
                    I mean, we're all equal, right? More
                    than equal -- more women are accepted
                    into law school now than men, and we do
                    better in those police simulations where
                    you can mistakenly shoot innocent people -
                           (rifles through the pages)
                     - I mean I don't know if you saw that
                    Dateline - but women practically have
                    penises now, right?
                           (looks to Janine, helpless)
                    Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me.

          Gigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine.

          

                                   JANINE
                    Don't worry.    He's totally gonna call.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATER


          
          Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in
          the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up
          the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS.

          

                                  GIGI
                    WHAT?   How can there be no dial tone?

          
          She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now.
                    I'll call you back.

          
          She hangs up, stares at the phone again. A look of
          DETERMINATION crosses her face. She dials.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so
                    I'm on the precipice of staging a casual
                    run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want
                    to stop me.
                           (beat, then really fast)

                    ALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS
                    tacit-compliance-bye.

          
          Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door.

          

          INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT


          
          A CROWDED, SCENEY restaurant/bar - with a giant red
          Japanese maple growing behind the bar (thus the name).

          
          We follow a THIN, BLACK CLAD HOSTESS as we wind through
          the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to:

          

          INT. RED MAPLE - KITCHEN - SAME


          
          A busy kitchen.   Off the kitchen a door leads to:

          

          INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME


          
          ALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through
          some papers. Then, from the doorway:

          

                                   KELLI ANN
                    Knock knock.

          Alex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess,
          standing in the doorway. She makes her way in.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Hey.

          

                                   KELLI ANN
                    So.    Here we are. Same shift again.

          

                                   ALEX
                    I know.    I make the schedule.

          

                                 KELLI ANN

                           (FLIRTING)
                    I figured it was no coincidence.

          
          She leans against the desk.     Alex keeps working.

          

                                 KELLI ANN (CONT'D)
                    I had fun the other night.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of
                    Patron will get you.

          
          Kelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice?

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight
                    after work...we could, you know...

          
          Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between
                    us the other night was - fun. But we're
                    way understaffed tonight - I even have to
                    man the bar - and that's why I scheduled
                    you. To work. So...

          
          He goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen.
          Alex can feel her eyes on him.

          

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Are we good here?

          
          Kelli Ann's face goes flush. She tries to hide it.    She
          backs up, puts on a smile.

          

                                   KELLI ANN
                    No.    We're good.

          
          She leaves.   Alex exhales, goes back to work.

          

          

                                     19

          INT. RED MAPLE - LATER


          
          In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands
          chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a
          cigarette he holds just outside the doorway.

          
          Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and

          ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD.
          He has to take a step to catch his balance.

          
          He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps
          walking eyes front. He and Tyrone share a look.

          

                                   TYRONE
                    Dude.

          

                                   ALEX
                    I know.

          
          Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy.

          

          INT. RED MAPLE - HOSTESS STAND


          
          Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor.

          
          She tries to move toward the bar as she's met by Kelli
          Ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile.

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    Are you joining us for dinner or -

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'm meeting someone.       A guy.

          

                                   KELLI ANN
                    Ugh.    Why?

          

                                   GIGI
                    Hmmmm?

          

                                  KELLI ANN
                    Nothing.   Sorry. For dinner?

          
          Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'm meeting someone.

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    I believe you mentioned that.

          
          Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor.

          

          

          

                                     20

                                    GIGI
                       I'm gonna wait at the bar.

          

                                    KELLI ANN
                       That's a great idea.

          
          Gigi walks off.    Kelli Ann takes her place behind the
          hostess stand.

          

          AT THE BAR

          
          Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.     Alex,
          now behind the bar, approaches.

          

                                    ALEX
                       What can I get you?

          

                                    GIGI
                       Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone.

          
          Alex takes her in.       She's clearly nervous.

          

                                      ALEX
                       Oh, yeah?    Got a hot date?

          

                                    GIGI
                       I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I
                       mean this guy Conor and I have only been
                       out the one time so --

          

                                    ALEX
                       Wait - Conor Barry?

          
          Gigi is busted.

          

                                    GIGI
                       Oh, uhh, yeah --

          

                                    ALEX
                       Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he
                       forget he was supposed to meet you?

          

                                    GIGI
                       See when I said "meeting someone" I guess
                       that was kind of a broad term, kind of a
                       wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-

          

                                    ALEX
                       Because I could just call him --

          
          Alex reaches for the phone.

                                 GIGI
                    NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I
                    mean, I actually was just - in the area -
                    so I figured I'd just swing by and see if
                    he was around - because - uhhh ---

          
          Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.    She is panicking.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    I uhh, had to return his --

          
          Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching
          for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN.
          She looks at it - and decides to go with it.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Pen. I had to return this - pen. He
                    left this. So, I thought I should really
                    return it before he - you know -
                           (conspiratorially to Alex)
                    -- freaks out.

          
          Alex looks at her skeptically.   And then takes the PEN,
          and inspects it.

          

                                 ALEX

                                 GIGI
                    Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may
                    or may not be important to someone.

          

                                 ALEX
                    That's not even his dentist.

          

                                  GIGI
                    Oh, really?   Then who's his dentist?

          

                                  ALEX
                    My dad.

          
          Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last
                    week. And I just...I thought if I ran
                    into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go.

          
          Gigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her -
          holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens.

                                 ALEX
                    Hey. Just - hang out for a second.
                    Lemme buy you a drink.

          
          Gigi SMILES and sits back down.

          

          INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT


          
          It's late. The bar is nearly empty. Alex is totaling
          receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm
                    just gonna be honest - Conor is never
                    going to call you.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Oh really? How do you know?

          

                                 ALEX
                    Because I'm a guy.   It's how we do it.

          

                                 GIGI

                           (HOPEFUL)
                    He said it was nice meeting me.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I don't care if he said you were his
                    favorite female since his mommy and
                    Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by -
                    and he didn't call.

          

                                 GIGI
                    But maybe he called me and I didn't get
                    the message. Or maybe he lost my number,
                    or was out of town, or was hit by a cab,
                    or his grandma died.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Or maybe he just didn't call because he
                    has no interest in seeing you again.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Yeah but my friend Terri once went out
                    with this guy who never called and she
                    totally wrote him off - then like a year
                    later she ran into him --

          

                                 ALEX
                    Your friend Terri's an idiot.   And she's
                    the exception.

                                  GIGI
                    OK.   But what if I'm the exception?

          

                                 ALEX
                    You're not. You're the rule. And the
                    rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he
                    doesn't want to call you.

          

                                    GIGI
                    Really?     Always?

          

                                 ALEX
                    Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a
                    woman looks like. I do it early and I do
                    it often. Trust me - if a guy is
                    treating you like he doesn't give a shit -
                    - he doesn't. No exceptions.

          
          Gigi thinks this over.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Why are you telling me all of this?
                    Aren't these man-secrets - like why men
                    need to watch televised golf?

          
          Alex LAUGHS.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I don't know. You looked like you could
                    really use the help.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Thank you. You've given me a lot to
                    think about.

          
          Gigi smiles at him.

          crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in.

                                GIGI
                    Sure. It's basically done.   But this is
                    important.

          

                                 JANINE
                    What's happening with your hair?

          
          Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi.

          

                                 BETH
                    Please come in my office before the
                    others see that you have mini muffin
                    stuck in your hair.

          

          INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - BETH'S OFFICE - DAY


          
          Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I think I figured it out. Remember when
                    I went out with that notary public? And
                    he cheated on me? And then Anastasia
                    from upstairs told us that story about
                    how her boyfriend cheated on her at the
                    beginning - but then he totally changed
                    and they're married and crazy in love.

          

                                 BETH
                    I thought that guy was a process server.

          

                                 GIGI
                    No, notary. Anyway, the point is -
                    Anastasia is the exception. Not the
                    rule. We have to stop listening to these
                    stories - because the rule is that most
                    guys who cheat on you up front don't
                    really care about you very much.

          

                                 BETH
                    Okay...

          
          Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived
                    in his storage space. He only used me
                    for rides, yet I continued to stalk him
                    for most of 1998. Then there was Don,
                    who broke up with me every Friday so he
                    could have his weekends free. I was so
                    delusional about our relationship that I
                    referred to him as my husband to random
                    people like my dental hygenist.

                    And all my friends would tell me stories
                    about how things might work out with
                    these dipshits because they knew someone
                    who knew someone who dated a dipshit just
                    like mine, and that girl ended up getting
                    married and living happily ever after.
                    But that's the exception. And we're not
                    the exception - we're the rule.

          
          Gigi sits down, spent.   But Beth has been listening.

          

                                 BETH
                    OK. So let me see if I understand. What
                    you're saying is that when people tell me
                    about some girl they know who dated a guy
                    for thirteen years, and then he finally
                    married her -- that's the exception. And
                    the rule is that guys - like Neil - who
                    are with girls - like me - for seven
                    years without getting married - are never
                    getting married.

          
          Beth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.

          

                                 GIGI
                    No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm
                    saying. This has absolutely nothing to
                    do with you. I was just talking, you
                    know, about me. Specifically.

          
          Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too.

          Anna and MARY, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side
          by side pedicure chairs. Anna holds a BUSINESS CARD.

          

                                 ANNA
                    It is impossible not to like this guy.
                    I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting
                    with me outside Eddie's, and then he
                    tells me he's married. You'd think I'd
                    be pissed, but I literally could not stop
                    myself from liking him.

          

                                 MARY
                    But he's married.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I realize that. I keep trying to force
                    myself to picture him in some church
                    saying vows to some woman, and even that
                    doesn't cool it off. What is my problem?

                                 MARY
                    OK. There was this guy who worked in my
                    dad's printing business. Married for
                    fifteen years to a nice lady. And then
                    he meets this woman at some church event.
                    And he told my dad he just had never felt
                    anything like it before. I mean, he had
                    finally met the love of his life. So, he
                    divorced his wife, and he's been with
                    this other woman for 22 years and they
                    are blissfully happy. I mean, what if
                    you meet the love of your life - but you
                    already married someone else? Are you
                    supposed to pass them by?

          

                                 ANNA
                    You're right. I'm calling him.

          
          Anna pulls her feet out of the pedicure bath, goes in a
          private corner, and dials her cell phone.

          

                                   ANNA (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Ben.    This is Anna Marks.

          

                                  BEN (O.S.)
                    Hey, Anna.   What's up?

          

                                 ANNA
                    Well, I was just taking you up on your
                    offer. You said you might know someone
                    who could help me out and I thought we
                    could discuss it -- over coffee?

          
          Anna waits for a response. On the other end she hears
          some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness.

          

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                    Look, I just...I can't Anna. You seem
                    great. It's just - I don't know. I
                    should go. Take care.

          
          Anna takes this in - STUNNED. She hangs up. Her eyes
          sting. She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird,
          bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.

          
          Finally, she looks at her cell phone and dials again.

                    I had sort of given up on you when you

                                 ANNA
                    Well, you know. I was just thinking
                    about you.

                    There are four. Sexy, smart, funny or
                    cute. And each person can only be two.
                    Like Sarah Jessica Parker is funny and
                    sexy. Or Bill Clinton is sexy and smart.

          

                                 CONOR
                    I love that you are hot for Clinton.

          

                                 ANNA
                    So, which am I?

          

                                 CONOR
                    What was I again?

          

                                 ANNA
                    Smart and cute.

          
          Conor smiles, happy for any compliment.

          

                                  CONOR
                    OK.   You're sexy. Very sexy.    And cute.

          
          She bangs him on the head with a pillow.

          

                                ANNA
                    No. Cute and sexy are in the looks
                    column. No one wants to be in all one
                    column.

                                 CONOR
                    Well, I sound like a jackass if I say
                    you're all four. But you're so obviously
                    all four. Especially sexy.

          

                                 ANNA
                    You're the best.

          
          Anna sits up, and moves to Conor. She looks at him,
          pulls him in for a nice, long HUG.

          

                                   ANNA (CONT'D)
                    I better go.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Oh. OK. I mean, you could just stay
                    here tonight.

          
          Anna gives him a knowing look.

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                    What?   It's been a while.

          

                                ANNA
                    I know. It's just - I'm fried.    Is that
                    alright?

          

                                  CONOR
                    Sure.   Of course.

          
          Anna smiles and gets up. Conor reluctantly follows her
          to the door. She KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS, smiles, and
          leaves.

          

          INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - NIGHT


          
          Beth opens the door to find NEIL, standing on the couch
          in his socks, hanging a PAINTING.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Hey babe, is this straight?

          

                                 BETH
                    Why are you hanging that?

          

                                 NEIL
                    I told you I'd do it weeks ago.   You
                    don't like it there?

          

                                 BETH
                    I love it there. But just - stop.

          

          

          

          

                                       29

          

          7/20/7                                                   30.

          

          

          

                                 NEIL
                    It's the image, isn't it? I didn't see
                    it before, but - you're right - it
                    totally looks like a sagging boob.

          
          Beth is silent.

          

                                 NEIL (CONT'D)
                    You want me to take it down?

          

                                    BETH
                    No.     I want you stop doing anything nice.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Is this a trick?

          

                                 BETH
                    No. I need you to stop being nice to me -
                    unless you're gonna marry me after.

          
          Neil laughs.

          

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                    Is that funny?

          

                                    NEIL
                    No.     It was just - I was just--

          

                                 BETH
                    See, you can't keep being nice to me and
                    I can't keep pretending like this is
                    something that it's not. We've been
                    together over seven years. You know me.
                    You either want to marry me or you don't.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Or there is the possibility that I just
                    don't really believe in the concept of -

          

                                 BETH
                    BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every
                    woman who's been told by some guy that he
                    doesn't believe in marriage just to see
                    him turn around eight months later and
                    marry some twenty four year old girl he
                    met at the gym. Bullshit.

          
          Beth tries to hold back her tears. Neil looks stunned.
          He hops down off the couch and goes to her.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Honey, where is all this coming from?

                                 BETH
                    From the place that I have been hiding
                    from you for the last five years because
                    I didn't want to seem demanding, or
                    clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never
                    ask. But now I'm going to ---

          
          Neil looks at her.    She looks at him.

          

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                    Are you ever going to marry me?

          
          Beth looks at Neil.    There is a long, painful SILENCE.

          

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                    I can't do this anymore.

          
          She walks out of the room.

          

          FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:    ... IF HE'S NOT MARRYING YOU

          
          AMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms.

          

                                 AMY
                    I was with Damon for six years. He asked
                    me to marry him on the phone, because
                    he's just so different and cool like
                    that. Said he'd eventually get me a
                    ring, which he didn't, but he did buy
                    himself a ring because isn't that so
                    hilarious and cool that the guy is
                    wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part
                    is, I stayed with him even after he took
                    back his proposal, and introduced the
                    idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't
                    that a cute name? Let me explain the
                    concept: it involves dating a girl from
                    the time she's thirty two to the time
                    she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her
                    of the ability to bear children, and
                    then, after all that, wanting to take a
                    year off. And giving it a fun name that
                    you can put on t-shirts.
                           (looks at the baby, smiles)
                    I left him.

          

          INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY


          
          Ben, our married guy from the grocery store, sits on the
          floor in a barely furnished room, and dials his cell.

          

          

          

          

                                       31

          

          7/20/7                                                 32.

          

          

          

                                 BEN
                    Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know
                    it's been a little while since you
                    called. I just - it took me by surprise.
                    But I offered to help you with your
                    career, and I don't see why I can't do
                    that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe
                    you can come by the office this week or
                    something. Okay, take care. Bye.

          
          Ben hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS
          TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE.

          

                                   JANINE
                    Hey, how --

          
          Ben is CLEARLY STARTLED.

          

                                 BEN
                    Shit - you scared me.

          
          Janine looks at him.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Is everything OK?

          

                                  BEN
                    Yeah.   Everything's fine.   Why?

          
          She sits down next to him, looks at him intently.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Are you smoking again?

          

                                   BEN
                    No, sweetie.    Why?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Well - you get jumpy when you smoke.

          
          Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close.

          

                                 BEN
                    I'm not smoking. So, why don't we worry
                    about what color we're gonna paint this
                    room, instead of worrying about things
                    that aren't happening?

          
          Janine contentedly curls up to Ben.

          

                                 JANINE
                    I don't know - I was thinking maybe -
                    pink?

          

          

                                     32

                                  BEN
                    Pink?   Seriously?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Well, I mean, at some point.

          
          Janine gives Ben a knowing look.   He gets it.

          

                                 BEN
                    You sure we're ready for this now?

          

                                 JANINE
                    No. But I mean, we could paint one room
                    pink and one blue just in case.

          
          Ben looks at her and LAUGHS.

          

                                 BEN
                    You've already created the perfect family
                    in this house, and we don't even have
                    drywall.

          

                                 JANINE
                    I'm sorry. I know I promised we'd wait
                    to talk about it -

          
          Ben looks at her, snuggled against him.

          

                                 BEN
                    I think we're almost ready to start
                    talking about it.

          
          Janine smiles CONTENTEDLY.

          

                                 JANINE
                    I've always liked the name Gisele.

          
          Ben LAUGHS.   She lets him.

          

          INT. PORTER'S - EVENING


          
          Packed, Federal Hill happy hour bar scene. Gigi and
          Janine stand, squeezed in among the after work crowd.

          
          JARRAD, early thirties, chats amiably with Gigi.

          

                                 JARRAD
                    Well, ladies, I guess I have to get back
                    to the office.

          

                                 GIGI
                    You go back to the office after happy
                    hour? What's happy about that?

                    I met you.

          
          Janine and Gigi melt.

          

                                 JARRAD (CONT'D)
                    So, I'd love to call you sometime.    Do
                    you have a card?

          

                                  GIGI
                    Of course.

          
          Gigi hands him her card with lightning speed.

          

                                 JARRAD
                    And here's my info.

          
          Jarrad hands Gigi HIS CARD as well.

          

                                 JARRAD (CONT'D)
                    Look forward to hearing from you, Gigi.

          
          He starts to head over to his BUDDIES.   Gigi is confused.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So, wait -- how are we doing this? Are
                    you hearing from me or am I getting a
                    call?

          
          Jarrad turns back.

          

                                  JARRAD
                    What?

          

                                 GIGI
                    You said you'd love to call me, but then
                    you said "look forward to hearing from
                    you." See how that's kinda confusing?

          

                                 JARRAD
                    Look - we'll talk. We'll get in touch.

          
          He tries to take off again.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Ooopsie - you did it again. Very vague.
                    You know what? Why don't we just say
                    that you'll call me, and then we can skip
                    all the nonsense.

          
          Jarrad just gives her a blank stare.

          

          

          

          

                                    34

          

          7/20/7                                                   35.

          

          

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Or I guess I could just call you --

          

                                 JARRAD
                    Goodbye, Gigi.

          
          He takes off.   The girls watch him.

          

                                   GIGI
                    He was cute.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Please don't cyber-stalk him.

          
          Gigi looks at the name on the card - JARRAD MONTROSE -
          and then - TEARS HIS BUSINESS CARD IN TWO.

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Wait - what are you doing?

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'm not calling him.    If he wants to see
                    me - he'll call.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Wow, that guy Alex really made an
                    impression on you. Was he hot?

          

                                  GIGI
                    No.   He was just -- right.

          
          Off Gigi, sipping her drink, full of optimism.

          

          INT. BALTIMORE BLADE - DAY


          
          The offices of Baltimore's gay weekly paper. The
          elevator opens - and in walks Mary, cheerful as always.

          
          We follow her down the hall as she ad-libs hellos to her
          co-workers. One thing becomes glaringly clear - SHE IS

          THE ONLY WOMAN WHO WORKS HERE.

          
          She gets to her desk and is descended upon by - BRUCE,
          NATHAN, and JOSHUA. All mid-20's. All gay.

          

                                   BRUCE
                    So?

          
          Mary looks at them, smiling, enjoying their impatience.

          

                                 MARY
                    He asked me out.

          

          

          

                                       35

          

          7/20/7                                                   36.

          

          

          

                                   NATHAN
                    Oh my god!    He called?

          

                                  MARY
                    Well -

          

                                  JOSHUA
                    He emailed?

          

                                  MARY
                    Umm -

          

                                 BRUCE
                    What? Did he travel by carriage and
                    leave his calling card with your lady in
                    waiting?

          

                                 MARY
                    He MySpaced me.

          
          The guys all look skeptical.

          

                                  NATHAN
                    Ouch.

          

                                 JOSHUA
                    I don't know. My slutty sister says
                    MySpace is the new booty call.

          

                                 MARY
                    Well, what am I supposed to do? Things
                    have changed. People don't just meet
                    organically anymore. If I want to make
                    myself more attractive to the opposite
                    sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I
                    update my profile. That's just how it
                    is.

          
          The guys look at her, starting to understand.   Mary's

          PHONE RINGS.

          

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                    Back to work.

          
          She smiles at the guys - they disperse as she picks up.

          

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                    Ad sales - this is Mary.

          

          INTERCUT WITH EXT. LIGHT ST. - DAY


          
          Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap.

          

          

          

                                     36

                                 CONOR
                    Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend.
                    Or whatever.

          

                                  MARY
                    Hey.   So, did you see it?

          

                                 CONOR
                    I'm not sure about this.

          

                                 MARY
                    You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning
                    market. You're gonna make a fortune.

          
          Conor looks at the paper.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you
                    have to put me on the page with the
                    massage ads?

          

                                 MARY
                    It was either that or on the page with
                    the personals. I made a call.

          

                                 CONOR
                    OK. You're right.      Hey, have you talked
                    to Anna lately?

          
          Conor leaves the paper and gets up. He walks away, still
          on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN.

          PAIGE, blonde and angelic, looks on as LAURA, CATHERINE,
          and Beth pull on matching coral dresses.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    I do not understand how you got mom to
                    sew all of these in two weeks.

          

                                 PAIGE
                    She wanted to do it.

          

          

          

                                      37

                                 LAURA
                    Mom told me she felt like an old
                    Indonesian lady in a sweatshop.

          

                                 PAIGE
                    No, she didn't.

          

                                 BETH
                    Why again do you need to get married so
                    fast?

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    You're so pregnant.

          

                                 PAIGE
                    I'm not pregnant.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    Chug a beer, then. I want to see you
                    chug a beer.

          

                                 PAIGE
                    We're in love, you assholes. That's what
                    people do when they're in love - they get
                    married.

          
          Everyone FREEZES.    And looks at BETH.   Big silence.

          

                                 PAIGE (CONT'D)
                    Bethie, you know I didn't mean --

          

                                   BETH
                    It's OK.    Neil and I are actually - done -
                    anyway.

          
          This is clearly news.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    Why didn't you tell us?    You should have
                    told us.

          

                                 LAURA
                    You have to come over and have dinner
                    with me and Steven and the kids tonight,
                    OK? You can even stay over if you want.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    Why would she want to hang out with us
                    and our husbands? Seriously, Beth, isn't
                    that exactly what you want to avoid right
                    now?

          
          But before Beth can even answer --

          

          

                                      38

                                 PAIGE
                    You know what - if being in the wedding
                    is too painful-

          

                                 BETH
                    You guys, it's cool. I'm fine.    So I
                    lost a little time. Big deal.

          
          Beth grabs her purse and starts for the door.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    So not a big deal. You're still really
                    young.

          

                                  PAIGE
                    So young.

                                 LAURA
                    Everything you learned in that
                    relationship is just gonna make the next
                    one so much stronger.

          

                                  BETH
                    Exactly.

          
          Beth exits, still wearing a half-sewn bridesmaid's dress.

          

                                 LAURA
                    She wasted so much time.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    I knew he was never gonna propose.

          

                                  PAIGE
                    Shit.

          
          The girls nod in agreement.

          

          INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY


          
          Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of
          papers. We PAN around to Anna sitting across from him.

          

                                 BEN
                    I know it's here somewhere. I spoke to
                    George Lane in music, and he gave me this
                    whole list of references for you.

          

                                   ANNA
                    It's cool.    You can call me when you find
                    it.

          

          

          

          

                                     39

          

          7/20/7                                               40.

          

          

          

                                 BEN
                    I swear I didn't lure you here under
                    false pretenses.

          

                                  ANNA
                    I know.   But a girl can dream.

          
          He looks up at her and smiles.

          

                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                    You're obviously too good of a guy.

          
          They share a LONG LOOK.

          

                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                    Why are you married, again?

          
          Ben LAUGHS.

          

                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                    Seriously. Why? It'll be good for me.
                    Tell me how you decided that you could
                    not be without this other woman.

          

                                 BEN
                    We'd been together since college. She
                    gave me an ultimatum: we get married or
                    we break up. So, we got married.

          

                                  ANNA
                    Seriously?   You just caved?

          

                                 BEN
                    It's complicated.

          

                                    ANNA
                    Really?

          

                                 BEN
                    You're a dick if you date a girl for too
                    long, and don't marry her. But you marry
                    her, and then you're an asshole for
                    marrying her before you're ready. Shit -
                    I don't know.

          
          He looks at her.

          

          

          

          

                                      40

          

          7/20/7                                                   41.

          

          

          

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                    You're really hot and I'm obviously
                    attracted to you, but I guess the best I
                    can do is eventually find this piece of
                    paper, and call you, and hope I help in
                    some small way with your career, and be
                    happy about that.

          
          Anna takes this in.

          

          INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - DAY


          
          Janine walks in from work to her construction site home.
          She peeks into the dining room, where she sees her CHERRY
          WOOD DINING TABLE covered in a THICK LAYER OF DUST.

          

                                    JANINE

                    JAVIER!

          
          She waits for a response. Nothing.    She starts to brush
          the dust off with her hands.

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)

                    JAVIER. I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT

                    TARPING THE FURNITURE.

          
          Still nothing. So Janine drops her work things, and
          heads out the side door of the house to a STORAGE AREA.

          

          EXT. STORAGE AREA - DAY


          
          There are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps.
          Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge,
          next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY.

          CIGARETTE BUTTS. AN EMPTY PACK OF AMERICAN SPIRITS.

          
          She stares at them for a moment, then heads back inside.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY


          
          CLOSE ON: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER. The
          name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE. Gigi sits, staring
          at the card. She reaches for the phone, and then thinks
          the better of it. And again.

          
          Finally, she grabs the receiver, picks it up, and dials.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Hi, this is Gigi.

          

          INTERCUT WITH:   INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - DAY


          
          Alex sits in his office.    He talks into his CELL.

          

          

                                      41

          

          7/20/7                                               42.

          

          

          

                               ALEX
                   Gigi?

          

                                GIGI
                   Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist
                   pen.

          

                               ALEX
                   Right.

          

                                GIGI
                   I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I
                   thought you had some really good insights
                   the other night and -- I had a question.

          

                                ALEX
                   Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor
                   is never going to be interested in you.

          

                                GIGI
                   No, I know. This is about -
                          (she looks at the card)
                   - Jarrad. You have a sec?

          

                               ALEX
                   Okay...

          

                                GIGI
                   So I meet him at happy hour and he was
                   completely charming --

          

                                ALEX
                   Lemme guess - he said the only thing
                   happy about this hour is you.

          

                                GIGI
                   He may have used some derivative of that.
                   So, he says he's going to call, but then
                   gave me his card and --

          

                                ALEX
                   He's not interested.

          

                                GIGI
                   You don't even know if he called --

          

                               ALEX
                   Did he?

          

                                GIGI
                   No. But the thing is, I honestly think
                   he's expecting my call.

                                (MORE)

          

          

                                  42

          

          7/20/7                                               43.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    He said "Look forward to hearing from
                    you" and not "Look forward to talking to
                    you." I mean, do you hear the
                    connotations?

          

                                   ALEX
                    He.   Is.   Not. Interested.

          
          Tyrone appears in Alex's doorway.

          

                                 TYRONE
                    Alex - this is jacked. The hostess is
                    giving me shit for not wearing a white
                    shirt -- this shirt is WHITE!

          
          Tyrone points to a VERY SMALL WHITE INSIGNIA on an
          otherwise BLACK SHIRT. Alex shuts the door on him.

          

                                 TYRONE    (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    This shit is white.

          

                                 ALEX
                    If a guy gives you his phone number,
                    instead of taking yours, he's not
                    interested.

          

                                 GIGI
                    He took mine first, but then he --

          

                                 ALEX
                    And, if a guy wants to see you, he will
                    see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's
                    until I got the right one.

          

                                   GIGI
                    That's cute.    What happened?

          

                                 ALEX
                    As it turned out, her ass looked really
                    huge in daylight.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Is it your sensitivity that makes you so
                    popular with women?

          

                                 ALEX
                    Don't call him. He doesn't like you.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Again with the sensitivity.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Just trying to help.

          

          

          

                                     43

          

          7/20/7                                                  44.

          

          

          

                                    GIGI
                      I know.   Thanks.

          
          Gigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card.

          

          EXT. DUNDALK HOME - BACKYARD - DAY


          
          CLOSE ON:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE.

          
          As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna
          and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny
          backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom.

          
          As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna
          grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom.

          

                                   MAYA
                      Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me
                      anything.

          

                                   ANNA
                      Mom - you always say that and I always
                      get you something.

          
          Maya takes a BIG SIP OF WINE (not her first) as she tears
          open the gift, which is clearly a RECORD ALBUM.

          

                                     MAYA
                      You didn't.

          

                                   ANNA
                      It's no big deal.

          

                                     CONOR
                      What is it?

          
          Maya shows him the album - TIM BUCKLEY'S STARSAILOR.

          

                                     CONOR (CONT'D)
                      Tim Buckley.    Nice.

          

                                   MAYA
                      Here - put on my favorite.

          
          Anna takes the album and heads through the screen door.

          

                                   MAYA (CONT'D)
                      Did Anna ever tell you I knew Tim
                      Buckley?

          

                                    CONOR
                      No.   She did not.

          "Song to the Siren" plays as Anna returns to the table.

          

                                 MAYA
                    We met at a coffee shop in 1971. Hell's
                    Kitchen. I had no idea who he was. But
                    he had this big mop of hair and these
                    eyes that just looked past you and
                    through you and into you all at the same
                    time. Complete interest and disinterest.
                    It was amazing.

          
          Maya pulls out a cigarette and lights it.

          

                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
                    Of course, I was with Anna's father at
                    the time, so, you know...another
                    opportunity missed.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Mom, please -

          

                                 MAYA
                    It's the truth. I knew them all. Robert
                    Plant, Harry Nilsson, Graham Parsons...
                           (to Conor)
                    Have you seen the pictures of me from
                    when I was Anna's age?

          

                                 CONOR
                    Umm - I don't think so -

          

                                 MAYA
                    Sweetie go get that picture - you know
                    the one -

          
          Anna just looks at her - pleadingly.

          

                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
                    Go. Your mother's asking you to do
                    something for her on her birthday.

          
          Anna goes inside.   Maya looks to Conor, takes a sip.

          

                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
                    You'll see - we look strikingly similar.
                    My lips may be a bit fuller, but...

          
          She leans back, puts out her cigarette as Anna returns
          with A PICTURE. She hands it to Conor.

          
          INSERT: MAYA, in her early twenties. Black and white -
          somewhere in New York. The resemblance to Anna is scary.

          

          

          

                                     45

          

          7/20/7                                                     46.

          

          

          

                                  CONOR
                    Wow.   That's - unbelievable.

          

                                 MAYA
                    So that's what we're dealing with here,
                    for reference. Imagine meeting someone
                    who looks like that in a coffee shop.

          
          Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.

          

                                 CONOR
                    That's funny, because, I mean, I guess I
                    kinda did. Anna and I met at a
                    restaurant. That serves coffee. So, not
                    a coffee shop, but...still -

          
          He looks from Maya to Anna.     Maya stands up.

          

                                 MAYA
                    That's sweet. But if we're comparing
                    stories -
                           (indicating with her glass)
                    She's no me - and you're no Tim Buckley.

          
          With that, Maya heads inside.

          

                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
                    Anyone need a refill?

          
          Anna looks to Conor apologetically.    He just smiles.

          

          EXT. ANNA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT


          
          Anna and Conor walk to the front door of her apartment.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Thanks again for coming with me.        You
                    make it so much easier.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Are you kidding? I like your mom.        She's
                    cool.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Yeah, well - cool's not always what
                    you're looking for in a mom.

          
          Conor smiles, understanding.

          

                                 CONOR
                    So, you want another -- foot rub?

          
          He's trying.   But it's awkward.

          

          

                                     46

          

          7/20/7                                                47.

          

          

          

                                 ANNA
                    Ugh. I'm just beat. I wanna put on
                    sweats and get in bed.

          

                                 CONOR
                    I'd be into that.

          
          Anna gives him a smile, opens her front door.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

          
          She gives him a KISS, and goes inside.

          

          FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:...IF HE/SHE'S NOT SLEEPING WITH YOU

          
          TRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his
          Ford Explorer. He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard -
          - goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc.

          

                                 TRENT
                    If a girl is into you, she's sleeping
                    with you. And if after a month - two
                    months at the very outside - she's not
                    sleeping with you, she does not like you.
                    I guess the trick is, how to spot this
                    girl early - so you don't waste the one
                    to seven weeks waiting to find out that
                    it's never gonna happen. So, I've got
                    some signs about how to spot this girl -
                    gleaned from my own experience, of
                    course. A girl will never sleep with you
                    if: she calls you cuddly or dependable,
                    she pops a zit in front of you, her name
                    is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump
                    in your bathroom or she takes home
                    leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not
                    scientific - but I'm just saying - you
                    were warned.

          

          INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT


          
          Alex knocks and opens the door in one motion.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Hey dude - you here?

          

                                 CONOR (O.S.)
                    Yep.

          
          Alex heads to the fridge, opens it and looks in.

          

          

          

          

                                    47

          

          7/20/7                                                48.

          

          

          

                                  ALEX
                    Wanna beer?

          
          He pulls TWO BEERS out, shuts the fridge and turns to
          find Conor standing there. He's wearing a REALLY TIGHT,
          SHINY SHIRT and EVEN TIGHTER, VERY BLUE JEANS.

          

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Or an apple martini?

          

                                  CONOR
                    Funny.

          
          Conor grabs the beer and opens it.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Need I ask?

          

                                 CONOR
                    It's for work. I'm trying to expand my
                    client base.

          

                                 ALEX
                    By pretending you're gay?

          

                                  CONOR
                    No.   By being more gay friendly.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Or, in real estate terms, by becoming
                    "gay adjacent".

          

                                   CONOR
                    Nice.    I may have to use that.

          
          Conor heads back toward his room.

          

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                    I'm gonna try something else. This may be
                    too much.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I don't know. You dress like that - and
                    you're already seeing a girl who won't
                    sleep with you - I think maybe you can
                    pull it off.

          

                                 CONOR (O.S.)
                    It's not that she won't sleep with me
                    douchebag...I have slept with her. It's
                    just, you know, she...um...

          

          

          

          

                                     48

          

          7/20/7                                                  49.

          

          

          

                                 ALEX
                    Won't sleep with you anymore.

          
          Conor reappears, now wearing A FRENCH CONNECTION TYPE

          TIGHT T-SHIRT AND BLACK JEANS.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Pretty much, yeah.
                           (re: his new outfit)
                    So, what do you think?

          
          Alex gives him the once over.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I think you're gonna have to beat 'em
                    away with a stick - you hot, sexy man.

          
          Conor rolls his eyes and heads back into his room.    Alex
          laughs to himself and takes another sip of beer.

          

          INT. FELL'S POINT CONDO - NIGHT


          
          Leather couch, framed Orioles jersey - typical bachelor
          pad. Gigi is making out with GREGORY, 30s.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Who would have thought that a random girl
                    from Pilates would fix me up with such a
                    good kisser?

          

                                 GREGORY
                    Back at you sister.

          
          Gigi beams.   They make out some more.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I can't wait to kiss you again.

          

                                  GREGORY
                    Umm.   We're kissing right now.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I know. But next time. The second date
                    kiss is way more intimate.

          
          As they start kissing again -

          

                                 GREGORY
                    Well, I'm going out of town tomorrow - so
                    I'll be out of touch for a bit.

          
          Gregory starts pulling off Gigi's top.    Gigi pulls away
          deftly.

          

          

                                     49

                                 GIGI
                    Would you excuse me a quick second?    Too
                    many diet cokes...

          
          Gigi makes a beeline down the hall.

          

          INT. FELLS POINT CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT


          
          Gigi dials her CELL as she goes through Gregory's
          bathroom cabinets.

          

          INTERCUT WITH:   INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
          Alex is also mid-makeout on his leather couch with a HOT
          WOMAN. The PHONE RINGS. Alex grabs it.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Yup.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Hey, sorry to bug you again.   Quick
                    question.

          

                                 ALEX
                           (to his hot lady)
                    Would you excuse me a second, babe?

          
          Alex walks into the hallway.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'm making out with a guy - PG stuff -
                    and then he mentions he's going out of
                    town, so he's gonna be out of touch.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Run.

          

                                 GIGI
                    But maybe he is going out of town.

          

                                 ALEX
                    To where? The Arab Emirates? Where is
                    he going that he has to be out of touch?

          
          Gigi opens the bathroom door and SHOUTS down the hall.

                                  ALEX
                    Run.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So, now what? I'm just supposed to run
                    from every guy who doesn't like me?

          

                                  ALEX
                    Uhh - yeah.

          

                                 GIGI
                    There's not going to be anyone left.

          
          Alex LAUGHS.

          

                                 ALEX
                    OK, I don't know why I'm saying this -
                    but I actually think I know a nice guy
                    who you might like.

          

                                  GIGI
                    Yeah?

          

                                ALEX
                    Yeah. He's a friend of my brother's.
                    Bill. We'll all meet for a drink - it'll
                    be good.

          
          Gigi smiles.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So, I'm in his bathroom right now.   What
                    do I now?

          

                                 ALEX
                    You gotta come out eventually. But I'd
                    really take my time. Let him sweat.

          
          He hangs up. Gigi finds some Crest Whitestrips and -
          with determination - decides to APPLY THEM.

          

          INT. GYM - EVENING


          
          Anna's rolling up mats, etc. as a sweaty Ben approaches.

          

                                 BEN
                    So, we ran into each other.

          

                                 ANNA
                    You came to my class.

          

          

                                    51

          

          7/20/7                                                 52.

          

          

          

                                 BEN
                    I didn't know it was your class.

          

                                 ANNA
                    You called and asked me.

          

                                 BEN
                    But you didn't call me back.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Because you said not to call back if it
                    was my class. Which it was.

          
          Ben recommits.

          

                                 BEN
                    We ran into each other.

          
          Anna LAUGHS.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Totally. A couple of innocent folks - by
                    happenstance - doing their daily workout
                    near one another.

          

                                  BEN
                    Exactly.   Thank you.

          
          As Anna picks up her bag and walks past him -

          

                                  ANNA
                    Wanna swim?

          
          Ben watches her go, not sure she's serious.

          

          INT. GYM POOL - NIGHT


          
          Big indoor pool. Clearly closed, lights off.    Anna opens
          the door with a KEY, Ben follows.

          

                                 BEN
                    I was just thinking - why can't we be
                    friends? Am I not allowed to make
                    friends anymore? Am I not allowed to be
                    friends with hot people? What kind of
                    reverse prejudice is that?

          

                                 ANNA
                    I hear you. Am I supposed to not be
                    friends with a guy just because he's
                    married, and happens to have this insane
                    smile and this ass that makes me want to
                    dry hump?

          

          

                                    52

          

          7/20/7                                                  53.

          

          

          

                                  BEN
                     I think I just fell in love.   A girl who
                     talks about a dry hump.

          

                                  ANNA
                     Classy, right?

          

                                  BEN
                     Classy is lame.

          
          Anna sits at the edge of the pool.

          

                                  ANNA
                     So, friends, right?

          

                                  BEN
                     Totally.

          
          And with that, Anna pulls off her top. And then her
          sweats. And, totally naked, slides into the pool.

          

                                  ANNA
                     You wanna come in?

          

                                   BEN
                     I'm sorry.   I don't trust myself.

          

                                   ANNA
                     OK.   You can just watch.

          
          He does.

          

                                  BEN
                     You may be the best friend I've ever had.

          
          Anna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water.

          

          INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT


          
          Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. Janine
          sits on the couch flipping through a magazine. He leans
          in to kiss her on the cheek. She does not look happy.

          

                                  JANINE
                     Honey - you smell different.

          
          Ben pulls back smoothly.

          

                                  BEN
                     Different how?

          

                                  JANINE
                     I don't know.

          

          

                                     53

          

          7/20/7                                                   54.

          

          

          

                                 BEN
                    Well that's an odd thing to say.

          
          She looks at him.    He tries to coolly meet her gaze.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I
                    found. In the side yard. What part of
                    "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for
                    you to wrap your brain around?

          

                                   BEN
                    What?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Do not lie to me, Ben.      Please.

          

                                 BEN
                    Are you serious? We have like eight
                    thousand undocumented workers in this
                    house daily. You find cigarettes, and
                    you automatically assume they're mine?

          

                                   JANINE
                    Well, yes.

          

                                 BEN
                    Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really
                    freaking out. I think the renovation is
                    getting to you because nothing is going
                    on. Just please - relax.

          
          Ben walks away.    Off Janine, wanting to believe him.

          

          EXT. BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB - DOCK - DAY


          
          Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands,
          unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat.
          NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered.

          

                                    NEIL
                    Ah.     My first visitor.

          

                                 BEN
                    This boat is sick. How come you never
                    invited me out before?

          

                                 NEIL
                    Well, this was supposed to be just for
                    Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave
                    our jobs. Sell the house. Take off.

          

          

          

          

                                      54

          

          7/20/7                                                   55.

          

          

          
          Neil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know
          what to say. They're silent for a second.

          

                                 NEIL (CONT'D)
                    Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission
                    to board granted. I'll show you around.

          
          Ben smiles, steps on to the boat.

          

          EXT. INNER HARBOR - DAY


          
          CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil
          smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out
          into the bay.   Ben stands across from him, looking on.

          

                                   NEIL
                             (re: cigarette)
                    Sorry.

          

                                    BEN
                    It's OK.

          
          Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben.

          

                                 NEIL
                    So Janine sent you to check on me?

          

                                   BEN
                    Yeah.    Pretty much.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Any message from Beth?

          
          Ben shakes his head no.    Neil seems disappointed.

          

                                 BEN
                    I think she's been busy getting ready for
                    her sister's funeral though, so...

          

                                 NEIL
                    Her sister's what?

          

                                   BEN
                    Wedding.    Her sister's wedding.   What did
                    I say?

          
          Neil is now LAUGHING HARD.

          

                                 NEIL
                    You said funeral.

          

                                 BEN
                    No, I didn't. Shit, did I?

          

          

                                       55

          

          7/20/7                                                   56.

          

          

          
          Neil LAUGHS HARDER.    Even Ben sees the humor.

          

                                 NEIL
                    The marriage thing is weird, man. I
                    never thought Beth would give me an
                    ultimatum.

          

                                    BEN
                    Really?     Why not?   That's what women do.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Right. I forgot. That's how Janine got
                    you to bite the bullet.

          

                                   BEN
                    Yup.

          
          Neil looks at Ben, curious.

          

                                 NEIL
                    Do you regret it?

          

                                   BEN
                    No.

          

                                 NEIL
                    So you're happy? You'd say you're
                    happily married?

          
          Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy.

          

                                 BEN
                    I love Janine.

          
          Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor.

          

          INT. BO BROOKS CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT


          
          We PAN down one of the long tables to find Beth, SMACKING
          a crab with a mallet. HARD. AND LOUD. The others at
          the table turn to look at her, annoyed. And that's when
          we see - there seems to be a party and SPEECH underway.

          

                                 COUSIN
                    Now, I know when my cousin Paige says
                    those vows tomorrow, there are going to
                    be hearts breaking all over the world.

          
          Beth's sister, Paige, smiles.

          

                                 COUSIN (CONT'D)
                    So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is
                    still on the market.

          

          

                                      56

          

          7/20/7                                                57.

          

          

          
          The cousin WINKS at Beth.   Beth goes white.

          

                                 COUSIN (CONT'D)
                    Sure, she's an older model, but she's
                    still got a lot of miles left in her.
                    But don't stay on the lot too long,
                    Bethie, or next year's models will --

          
          KEN MURPHY, 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic.

          

                                 KEN
                    OK - that's enough of the speeches. Time
                    to eat. So enjoy the crab. And the
                    yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the
                    crab's hepatopancreas.

          
          Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down.
          He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth
          trying to make a sneaky exit. He catches up to her.

          

                                 KEN (CONT'D)
                    Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a
                    jackass.

          

                                   BETH
                    I know.    And even he's married.

          

                                 KEN
                    So, you'll get married a little bit later
                    than some people. Big deal. You never
                    did anything the way every one else did
                    it, and that's what I've always thought
                    was so great about you.

          

                                 BETH
                    I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the
                    only one not married. If this was
                    Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to
                    sacrifice me or something.

          
          Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth.

          

                                 KEN
                    Honey, look. When everyone else was just
                    going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my
                    New York Times, found some arts camp in
                    the Berkshires, wrote away for
                    information, then got accepted on your
                    own. You were nine. You never did
                    things the way everyone else did.

          

                                  BETH
                    Why not?

          

          

                                      57

          

          7/20/7                                                   58.

          

          

          

                                   KEN
                      Because that's you.   That's why you're my
                      favorite daughter.

          
          Beth's eyes go WIDE.

          

                                   BETH
                      I don't think you're supposed to say
                      that.

          

                                   KEN
                      Well, I don't give a shit. I'm retired,
                      and I'll say what I want. I'll say it
                      into the mic if you want --

          

                                   BETH
                      That's OK.

          

                                   KEN
                      It's true, though.

          

                                   BETH
                      I know.

          
          They HUG.

          

          INT. FRAZIER'S ON THE AVENUE - NIGHT


          
          Gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when Alex comes in the
          door and goes directly to her table.

          

                                   ALEX
                      Sorry I'm late.

          

                                   GIGI
                      That's OK. I like a little time before a
                      blind date - prepare myself mentally,
                      remind myself not to tell the story about
                      my molars --

          

                                   ALEX
                      He's not coming.

          
          Alex motions to the WAITRESS to bring them another round.

          

                                   ALEX (CONT'D)
                      Can't wait to hear that story about the
                      molars, though.

          

                                   GIGI
                      How can he already not like me?

          

          

          

          

                                     58

          

          7/20/7                                                59.

          

          

          

                                 ALEX
                    I screwed up. I told Bill it was
                    Thursday, but I meant Tuesday.

          
          Gigi is disappointed. The waitress drops off their
          drinks. They toast - then observe the SCENE AT THE BAR.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who
                    can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday -
                    and meanwhile this girl -
                           (motions to GIRL at the bar)
                    - she's probably meeting her soul mate
                    as we speak.

          
          The GIRL is standing between TWO GUYS.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Nope.

          

                                 GIGI
                    How do you know?

          

                                 ALEX
                    See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise
                    thing. She's interested. He's not.

          

                                 GIGI
                    You cannot tell from a cursory glance
                    that he's not interested.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant.
                    I see this stuff go down every night.
                    Watch --

          
          As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the
          GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink. Tom Cruise
          Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. Alex looks smug.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Man, you have a gift.

          

                                 ALEX
                    And check out droopy dawg on her other
                    side. He can buy her drinks all night,
                    and she'll insist there's no "spark."

          

                                 GIGI
                    Maybe there isn't.   You need a spark.

          

                                 ALEX
                    The "spark" thing is bullshit.

          

          

                                    59

          

          7/20/7                                                60.

          

          

          

                                   GIGI
                    Really?    Enlighten me.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Guys invented the "spark" so they could
                    not call and treat you kind of bad and
                    keep you guessing, and then convince you
                    that the anxiety and fear that it creates
                    in you is actually a "spark." And you
                    all buy it. You love it. You all thrive
                    on it because you all love drama.

          

                                  GIGI
                    I don't.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Really? So you don't wait until the last
                    minute on deadlines, or on phone bills,
                    because you love the drama of not knowing
                    whether you'll make it?

          
          She's busted.

          

                                  GIGI
                    Maybe.

          

                                 ALEX
                    And let me guess - when you were stalking
                    Conor that night - were you obsessing
                    about him calling for days, even though
                    the date was just kind of mediocre?

          

                                  GIGI
                    OK.   Yeah.

          

                                 ALEX
                    See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be
                    more like me - if a girl likes me great,
                    if not, there are plenty more like her -
                    probably with smaller pores and bigger
                    implants.

          

                                 GIGI
                    That's beautiful.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Thanks.

          
          They continue drinking and observing the scene.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Why are you sharing all this inside
                    dating information with me again?

          

          

                                     60

          

          7/20/7                                                  61.

          

          

          

                                   ALEX
                    I dunno.    I like you.

          

                                  GIGI
                    You do?

          

                                 ALEX
                    Don't start doodling my name on your
                    binder. I just mean, I like you, like I
                    like basset hounds. They're kinda
                    pathetic - so you want to cheer them up.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Again with the sensitivity.

          
          Alex smiles at her.   Gigi can't help but smile back.

          

          INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING


          
          Janine walks down the hallway, with JAVIER (40, stocky),
          her contractor. She's inspecting the crown molding.

          

                                 JANINE
                    It looks good.

          

                                  JAVIER
                    Yes.

          

                                 JANINE
                    He does good work.

          

                                 JAVIER
                    He's very good.

          
          Janine stops and looks at Javier.   He looks back at her.

          

                                  JANINE
                    Javier.

          

                                  JAVIER
                    Yes.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Javier, if I asked you an honest
                    question, do you think you could give me
                    an honest answer?

          

                                  JAVIER
                    I think so.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Good. Because I think some of your guys
                    have been - smoking.

          Janine looks at Javier.    It's awkwardly silent.

          

                                    JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Javier?

          

                                 JAVIER
                    Is that the question?

          

                                    JANINE
                    Yes.

          

                                   JAVIER
                    Oh.    It seemed like a statement.

          

                                 JANINE
                    The question part was implied -

          

                                 JAVIER
                    I didn't really hear it in the inflection-

          

                                 JANINE
                    Javier - have your guys been smoking or
                    not?

          

                                JAVIER
                    No, ma'am. My guys don't smoke on the
                    job site. They're all good guys.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Are you sure your guys aren't sneaking
                    around here? And smoking? And lying to
                    me? And -- smoking?

          
          She's starting to freak Javier out.

          

                                 JAVIER
                    I'm pretty sure.

          

                                 JANINE
                    I need you to be honest with me, Javier.
                    Because I can't have someone lying to me.
                    To my face. Under my roof. On my time.

          

                                 JAVIER
                           (very softly)
                    That's a lot of prepositions...

          
          Janine does not hear him, and barrels on -

          

                                 JANINE
                    I mean, there is no reason for that kind
                    of dishonesty, is there? IS THERE? I
                    mean, we made promises to one another --

          

          

                                      62

          

          7/20/7                                                   63.

          

          

          
          Javier looks at her - what the hell is she talking about?

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    What I mean is, we had a contract. Which
                    is like making promises to each other,
                    right?

          

                                 JAVIER
                    Maybe I should just get back to work.

          

                                    JANINE
                    Yes.   Fine.    Good idea.

          
          Javier starts to leave.

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    But, we're good here, right?     Me and you?

          
          Blank stare from Javier.    Janine slaps on a smile.

          

                                    JANINE (CONT'D)
                    Okay, great.     The molding really does
                    look great.

          
          Javier gives a forced smile, and heads back to work.

          

          INT. MT. VERNON ROW HOUSE - DAY


          
          TWO WELL BUILT MEN (SKIP and LARRY) sip from bottles of
          Volvic water as they wander through a kitchen, inspecting
          the cabinetry. Conor comes into to frame, wearing a
          toned down version of his "gay friendly" clothes.

          

                                 CONOR
                    Hello, my name is Conor. Please sign in
                    whenever you get a chance.

          
          He gestures to a guest book on the kitchen island - next
          to which Anna stands. Conor joins her.

          

                                 ANNA
                    This is insane. You're like the Liza
                    Minelli of real estate.

          

                                   CONOR
                    I know.    Your friend Mary's a genius.

          
          The house is TEEMING WITH GAY COUPLES - opening closets,
          admiring floors, munching on complimentary cookies.

          

                                  ANNA
                    Alright.   Gotta run.

          

          

          

                                      63

          

          7/20/7                                                   64.

          

          

          

                                 CONOR
                    You got a class?

          

                                  ANNA
                    Uh, no.   Just some stuff.    See you later?

          

                                 CONOR
                    Sure.

          
          Conor goes in for a HUG, but Anna's not ready for it - so
          he just ends up grabbing her. It's awkward. She leaves,
          Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.

          
          Skip and Larry look at him sympathetically.

          

                                 CONOR (CONT'D)
                    What?

          

                                 SKIP
                    She's holding out on you, isn't she?

          

                                 CONOR
                    I'm not sure I get your meaning.

          

                                 LARRY
                    It's obvious. She won't sleep with you.
                    It's written all over your puppy dog
                    face.

          
          Conor looks at them, decides not to fight it.

          

                                 CONOR
                    It's killing me. Literally.     I'm dying.

          
          Skip and Larry move closer, Larry grabs a plate.

          

                                 LARRY
                    Here, have a cookie.

          

                                 CONOR
                    I just - I have no idea what she's doing.
                    I cannot read her signals - at all. We
                    used to sleep together - all the time.
                    Well, that's not true, I don't know why I
                    said that, it wasn't all the time. But
                    it did happen - I know I'm not making
                    this up. And then, out of nowhere, it
                    stops. But she still calls, she stops
                    by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a
                    massage, she leaves cute messages - but
                    it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is
                    she doing?

          7/20/7                                                   65.

          

          

          

                                 LARRY
                    Honestly - we may not have the best
                    insight. Gay signals have nothing to do
                    with straight signals.

          

                                 SKIP
                    He's right. Like - here's "I want to
                    sleep with you".

          
          He looks at Larry.   Larry looks back at him.    They don't
          break their gaze.

          

                                 LARRY
                    One, two, three - that's it.   Three
                    seconds or more - it's on.

          

                                 SKIP
                    Here's "I don't want to sleep with you."

          
          Skip look at Larry again.   Larry meets his gaze.

          

                                 LARRY
                    One, two -
                           (he looks away)
                    No. Thanks for playing.    Move along.

          

                                 SKIP
                    It's that simple.

          

                                 CONOR
                    You're right. That's no help at all.

          

                                 LARRY
                    But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or
                    straight, you're not going to get
                    anywhere by being inactive. She clearly
                    likes you - maybe she just wants you to
                    be a man and do something. So the next
                    time you're in the position - don't take
                    no for an answer.

          
          Skip looks at Larry, concerned.

          

                                 SKIP
                    That sounds like felonious advice.

          

                                 LARRY
                    You're right. Let me rephrase.    Don't
                    take maybe for an answer.

          
          Conor takes this in - that's not a bad idea.

          INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
          Cute studio apartment. And Ben is in the bed. Anna
          walks in from the bathroom, in a robe. Ben watches her.

          

                                      BEN
                      Wait.   Stop.

          

                                      ANNA
                      What?

          

                                    BEN
                      Shit.   This is bad.

          

                                      ANNA
                      What?

          

                                   BEN
                      I am so into you.

          
          Anna BEAMS.   She joins him in bed.

          

                                   BEN (CONT'D)
                      I'm lying here watching you and I
                      seriously have never felt this way
                      before. I have to forcibly make my brain
                      stop thinking about you. I mean, all the
                      time.

          

                                      ANNA
                      Why stop?

          
          She looks at Ben.    He's not smiling.

          

                                   BEN
                      Because I don't do stuff like this.

          

                                   ANNA
                      Stuff like what?

          

                                   BEN
                      Like having sex with women who are not my
                      wife.

          

                                   ANNA
                      First of all, I'm not women.   I'm just
                      one.

          
          He waits.

          

                                   BEN
                      What's second of all?

                                 ANNA
                    I didn't have a second of all.

          

                                 BEN
                    I thought second of all was going to make
                    me feel better.

          
          Anna thinks.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Second of all - I can't stop thinking
                    about you, either.

          
          They look at each other for a LONG MOMENT.

          

                                 BEN
                    I have to tell her.

          

                                  ANNA
                    What?

          

                                 BEN
                    I have to tell her.

          
          Anna's eyes light up, but she tries to cover.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I don't want to push you to --

          

                                 BEN
                    I want to be with you. And I can't do
                    that if I'm lying to her.

          

                                 ANNA
                    You know what's best.

          
          As Ben pulls her to him, she lets a smile take hold.

          

          FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:   ...IF HE'S MARRIED

          
          LOUIS, 60's, with a kind but very wise face, talks to the
          camera in his FORMAL DOORMAN attire, standing in front of
          a posh Upper East Side building.

          

                                 LOUIS
                    Here's the thing - my daughter is happily
                    married with kids and running a tanning
                    salon on Staten Island. But if she
                    wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd
                    like to tell a lot of the girls that come
                    in and out of this building on the arm of
                    a married guy.

                                 (MORE)

          7/20/7                                                   68.

          

                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                    And here is that advice --- get stocks,
                    cash, annuities, a deed in your name.
                    Don't settle for flowers and a shopping
                    spree at Bendel's. Think to the future.
                    We all know that none of these guys is
                    gonna leave his society wife and let her
                    keep half the money and the classic eight
                    on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these
                    young ladies, as long as you only have
                    the guy for a finite period of time --
                    get something that can last. Because I
                    guarantee you - he won't. And that's the
                    best fatherly advice I can give.

          

          INT. RITE AID - DAY


          
          Mary and Anna, in sweats and Ugg boots and dirty hair,
          both load their carts with cheap beauty products.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I'm not picking out china patterns or
                    anything - but I've never felt anything
                    like this before.

          

                                 MARY
                    This is crazy. I can't believe he's
                    gonna leave his wife for you.

          

                                 ANNA
                    No, he's not leaving his wife for me.
                    He's just - he's a good guy. And he
                    can't really explore what we could be if
                    he's lying to her.

          
          Mary looks at her.

          

                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                    He's kind of leaving his wife for me. Is
                    this crazy? This is totally crazy. We
                    barely know each other.

          

                                 MARY
                    I don't know.   Remember Becca, my
                    sister's friend. Some guy waits on her
                    at Bennigan's - by the end of the night
                    they both knew they had found the one.

          

                                 ANNA
                    You're totally right.   It can happen.

          

                                  MARY
                    Not for me.

          

          

          

          

                                    68

          

          7/20/7                                                69.

          

          

          

                                 ANNA
                    Well, what about texter?

          

                                 MARY
                    Texter has yet to make any verbal
                    contact. I mean, this guy could have had
                    surgery that left him without a voice
                    box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd
                    never know because I never actually hear
                    his voice.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I doubt he has a stoma -

          

                                 MARY
                    That's not the point. The point is - I
                    can't text. I'm not charming via text.
                    My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't
                    type fast enough on the little phone
                    keyboard --

          

                                 ANNA
                    So don't text.

          

                                 MARY
                    It's not just texting. It's email and
                    voicemail and snail mail -

          

                                 ANNA
                    That's just mail -

          

                                 MARY
                    Whatever. None of it's working. I've
                    had a guy leave a voicemail for me at
                    work, and then I call him back at home,
                    and he emails me to my Blackberry, and
                    then I text him to his cell and then he
                    emails me to my home account from the
                    plane phone -- and it just totally gets
                    out of hand. I miss the days where you
                    had one phone number with one answering
                    machine that housed one cassette tape and
                    either the cassette tape had a message
                    from the guy or it didn't. That's it.
                    Now you have to go around checking all
                    your portals and get rejected by seven
                    different technologies. It's exhausting.

          
          Anna, who is trying a different shade of nail polish on
          each finger, calmly looks up at Mary.

          

                                 ANNA
                    So what about the singer guy?

          

          

                                    69

          

          7/20/7                                                   70.

          

          

          

                                   MARY
                    Jude.    Yeah, I like him.

          

                                 ANNA
                    That's great.

          

                                    MARY
                    Totally.     I felt like we connected.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
          Gigi sits on the couch, wrapped in a blanket, eating
          graham crackers and watching SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL on
          TV. The phone RINGS.

          

                                   GIGI
                    Hello.

          

          INTERCUT WITH: INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - NIGHT


          
          Even in the office we can hear the din of the bar scene.

          

                                    ALEX
                    Oh, hey.     You're home.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Where am I supposed to be?

          

                                   ALEX
                    Out.    It's Saturday night.

          

                                 GIGI
                    You won't let me go out with guys who
                    don't like me. It's kind of limiting.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I was just calling to let you know - I'm
                    having a party at my place next weekend.
                    You should come.

          
          Gigi considers this.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I don't know. Won't Conor be there?
                    Might be kinda awkward.

          

                                 ALEX
                    He's in DC for the weekend at some real
                    estate conference. But there's gonna be
                    a bunch of single guys.

          

          

          

          

                                      70

          

          7/20/7                                                 71.

          

          

          

                                 GIGI
                    So I will have plenty of chances to be
                    awkward. Thank god.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Don't worry. I'll be there.      I'll talk
                    you through it.

          
          Gigi smiles.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So, the party - is it like a big party,
                    more of a mellow hang or --

          
          A CRASH outside Alex's office.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Yeah, OK. Gotta go - I think someone
                    just dropped 84 wine glasses.

          
          Gigi hangs up, and goes back to watching her movie.

          
          CLOSE ON: The TV screen as Mary Stuart Masterson (as
          WATTS) and Eric Stoltz (as KEITH) hang out in a garage.

          

                                 WATTS
                    Amanda Jones is no minor leaguer who'll
                    be swept off her feet at the touch of
                    your amateur lips.

          

                                 KEITH
                    I think I can handle it.

          

                                 WATTS
                    It's cool. I was just gonna work on it
                    with you but - if you're
                    comfortable...great.

          

                                  KEITH
                    Wait.   How do you work on it?

          

                                 WATTS
                    Pretend I'm a girl, OK?    I mean, pretend
                    I'm her...Amanda.

          
          Gigi sits up. A light bulb has gone off. As she watches
          Keith and Watts kiss on screen, a smile crosses her face.

          

          INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY


          
          Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine:

          

          

          

          

                                    71

                                GIGI
                   He's into me.

          

                                JANINE
                   Awesome. I knew it.
                          (she hugs Gigi)
                   Who's this now?

          

                               GIGI
                   Alex. It's totally clear to me now.
                   He's Watts.

          

                                JANINE
                   What?

          

                                GIGI
                   From Some Kind of Wonderful.

          

                                JANINE
                   Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts?

          

                                GIGI
                   Yes.

          

                                JANINE
                   So, why aren't you Watts?

          

                                GIGI
                   I'm Eric Stoltz.

          

                                JANINE
                   What?

          

                                GIGI
                   Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric
                   Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones,
                   but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz
                   herself.

          

                                JANINE
                   Wait - so who's Amanda Jones?

          

                                GIGI
                   I guess Conor at first. Now men in
                   general. But that's not the point.    The
                   point is -- he's into me.

          

                                JANINE
                   You know, I knew there had to be a reason
                   he was spending all that time with you.

                                 GIGI
                    I know! It's so obvious now -- there are
                    so many signs.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Oooh, gimme the signs.   I love to hear
                    about the signs.

          
          Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk.

          

                                 GIGI
                    At first they were small - like when I
                    first called he said "Good to hear from
                    you" -

          

                                 JANINE
                    Totally good sign.

                                 GIGI
                    Right? And then the next time I called
                    he was with a woman - but he still took
                    the call. And talked to me for a while.

          

                                 JANINE
                    You know it was a woman?

          

                                 GIGI
                    He called her "babe."

          

                                 JANINE
                    A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to
                    another woman - unless there's something
                    going on.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I know! And it gets more obvious. I
                    mean, please - there was no guy he was
                    going to fix me up with. The fix up was
                    him.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Wait - really?

          

                                 GIGI
                    He shows up - without this fictitious
                    Bill character - and the two of us
                    basically have a date. And then he calls
                    me to invite me to a party at his place.

          

                                 JANINE
                    You're right. He so likes you.

          
          Janine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen.

          

          

                                    73

          

          7/20/7                                                   74.

          

          

          

                                   JANINE (CONT'D)
                      Let's look up places for your destination
                      wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa
                      Valley - I've always wanted to go there.

          
          Gigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching.

          

          INT. BALTIMORE BLADE OFFICES - DAY


          
          Mary sits at her desk, surrounded by her gays.    They are
          all looking at her computer screen.

          

          CLOSE ON:   A MYSPACE PAGE. NAME:"YOUR SOUL-UTION"

          SEX: MALE   AGE: 29 FROM: FUNKYTOWN FRIENDS : 1282

          

                                   MARY
                      There's no way he's already called - we
                      only met for coffee last night. I mean
                      we video iChatted. While holding coffee.
                      Kinda like having coffee.

          
          Nathan hands her the phone.

          

                                   NATHAN
                      Just call your voice mail.

          

                                   MARY
                      And he told me he had a gig last night,
                      so he probably got in real late. Did I
                      tell you he was singer?

          

                                    BRUCE
                      Just call.

          
          Mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials.

          Mary hits the SPEAKERPHONE button.

          Mary is clearly charmed.    The gays all SWOON.

          

                                   NATHAN
                      I just got hard.

                      So, call me back. Bye.

                      Amazing.    He'll sing to your babies.

          
          Mary basks in the attention.       Then, ANOTHER BEEP.

          

                                   YOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.)

          SOME RUSTLING NOISES, and a HANG UP, followed by a dial
          tone. Mary stares at the phone - then pushes a BUTTON.

          INT. HOME DEPOT - DAY


          
          CLOSE ON: TWO SEEMINGLY IDENTICAL PLANKS OF WOOD. We
          pull back to reveal Ben and Janine, in the wide aisle of
          Home Depot, as Janine really studies the two pieces of
          wood. Finally, she POINTS to one of them.

          

                                    JANINE
                      That one.

          

                                    BEN
                      No.   That's the laminate.

          

                                   JANINE
                      That one isn't real hardwood floor?

          

                                   BEN
                      No. But it looks exactly the same - at
                      like one one hundredth of the cost.

          
          Janine considers this.

          

          

          

          

                                       75

          

          7/20/7                                                   76.

          

          

          

                                 JANINE
                    I still wanna go with the real wood.

          

                                 BEN
                    But you can't even tell the difference.

          

                                 JANINE
                    That's not the point.

          

                                 BEN
                    Then what's the point?

          

                                 JANINE
                    I just don't like the way it's pretending
                    to be wood. If you're not wood, then
                    don't try to look like wood.

          

                                 BEN
                    I don't think it's pretending --

          
          Ben is making light.   But Janine is all business.

          

                                 JANINE
                    It's a lie. Just be up front - tell
                    people what you really are.

          
          Ben takes this in.   His cheeks start to burn.

          

                                 BEN
                    You're right. I'm sorry.      You're totally
                    right.

          

                                 JANINE
                    It's OK. Maybe we should look at the
                    grills and come back.

          
          As she starts to steer their giant cart away, Ben just
          stands there, fused to the ground. Finally:

          

                                 BEN
                    I slept with someone.

          
          Janine stops, doesn't say anything.

          

                                   BEN (CONT'D)

                    I --

          

                                   JANINE
                    I heard you.

          
          She doesn't turn to face him.     Total silence.

          

          

          

          

                                     76

          

          7/20/7                                               77.

          

          

          

                                 JANINE (CONT'D)
                    You tell me this in Home Depot because
                    you know how I hate a public scene.

          

                                 BEN
                    That is not why I -

          

                                    JANINE
                    I knew it.     I KNEW IT.   You asshole.

          

                                   BEN
                    I'm sorry.    I'm so sorry.

          

                                 JANINE
                    And it's you that's been smoking, too,
                    isn't it?

          

                                  BEN
                    What?   Why does that matter?

          
          Janine turns to Ben.    She is IRATE.

          

                                 JANINE

                    HAVE - YOU - BEEN - SMOKING?

          

                                    BEN
                    No.   No.    I haven't.

          
          Janine just STARES AT HIM, FUMING.

          

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                    Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I
                    could stay on his boat for a while if --

          
          Now Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief.

          

                                 JANINE
                    EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out?
                    You're like - what - leaving me?

          
          Ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it.

          

                                 BEN
                    No. NO. I just assumed that you
                    wouldn't want me to --

          

                                 JANINE
                    We're not going to deal with this? We're
                    not going to figure out a way to work
                    through this?

          

          

          

          

                                      77

          

          7/20/7                                                  78.

          

          

          

                                 BEN
                    I just assumed that once I told you, you
                    would want me -- out.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Is that what you want?

          

                                 BEN
                           (almost a whisper)
                    No.

          

                                 JANINE

                    OK.

          
          She heads down the aisle with the cart. Ben follows,
          confused - that didn't go how he thought it would.

          

          EXT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY


          
          The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the-
          century mansion. The procession of a wedding has just
          begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off.

          
          Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with
          her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her
          husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around.

          
          Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort
          - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow
          tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy -
          who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy.

          

          INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY


          
          A lavish reception. Beth takes her seat next to DAN,
          40s. Dan looks over at Beth's place card.

          

                                 DAN
                    You must be Beth.

          

                                 BETH
                    Yep.

          

                                 DAN
                    I've heard a lot about you from Paige.
                    I'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated
                    next to her single sister.

          

                                 BETH
                    Oh, yeah? So you are -
                           (looks at his placecard)
                    Dan.

                                   DAN
                    Uh, sort of.

          

                                   BETH
                    Hmmm?

          

                                 DAN
                    Well, I'm actually a wiccan.    So I have a
                    magickal name.

          

                                   BETH
                    Really?

          

                                 DAN
                    It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse. But I
                    didn't know if that would fit on a card.

          
          Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine.

          

          INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
          A PARTY is in full swing. Typical affair for someone in
          their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol.

          
          Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix.
          She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So
          Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls
          of Chex Mix into her mouth.

          

                                 NATHAN
                    It makes your breath stink.

          

                                   GIGI
                    Pardon?

          
          Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay
          coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday
          night gay mode - standing next to her.

          

                                 NATHAN
                    Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I
                    made out with a guy after eating like a
                    bag of the stuff. He said my breath
                    smelled like trout.

          
          Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Thanks for the tip.

          

                                 NATHAN
                    I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy
                    I made out with was a total asshole.

          

          

                                     79

          

          7/20/7                                                 80.

          

          

          

                                 BRUCE
                    You want me to smell you?   I'm sure you
                    don't smell like trout.

          
          Gigi LAUGHS.

          

                                  GIGI
                    Thanks.   I'm good.

          
          She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath.

          

                                  NATHAN
                    I'm Nathan.   This is Bruce.

          

                                  GIGI
                    Gigi.   How do you guys know Alex?

          

                                 BRUCE
                    We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it
                    from some guy named Conor.

          
          Gigi smiles in recognition.

          

                                 NATHAN
                    How do you know Alex?

          

                                 GIGI
                    I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure -
                    something is about to happen between us.

          

                                 NATHAN
                    So, you're here as like a guest, or like
                    his date?

          

                                 BRUCE
                    I hate that - when you don't know if
                    you're a date - so you don't know if you
                    should bring a friend, or if you're like
                    co-hosting or if you should stay til the
                    end to have alone time --

          
          Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.

          

                                 GIGI
                    He didn't really say.

          
          She reflexively GRABS FOR THE CHEX MIX and starts gorging
          on it again. Nathan stops her.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest.
                    I mean - there have been signs.

          

          

          

                                    80

          

          7/20/7                                                  81.

          

          

          

                                    NATHAN
                    Cool.

          

                                 BRUCE
                    I did get a slight waft of trout, though.
                    Take a mint.

          
          He reaches in his pocket.    Gigi looks at him gratefully.

          

                                    GIGI
                    Thank you.

          

          INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - NIGHT


          
          Dinner is over. The dance floor is crowded. The bride,
          Paige, is out there. Beth's dad is dancing with her mom.

          
          Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the
          dance floor with DOMINIC, 50s and fat.

          

                                 DOMINIC
                    So, where's Neil?

          

                                 BETH
                    We actually broke up.

          

                                DOMINIC
                    No way. You guys were together for like
                    ten years.

          

                                  BETH
                    Seven.   But yes, a long time.

          
          They continue to dance.

          

                                 DOMINIC
                    Too bad cousins can't marry, huh?    Cuz
                    then we could maybe --

          

                                 BETH
                    Eeew Dominic, gross.

          
          Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs. And then
          they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

          
          Everyone has stopped dancing. They are looking to the
          floor, near the band. Beth pushes her way through to see-

          

          HER DAD. HE HAS FALLEN TO HIS KNEES. HE'S CLUTCHING HIS

          CHEST. AND HIS FACE IS TURNING AN ASHY, TERRIFYING GRAY.

          INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
          The place is packed. Gigi is smashed into a hallway,
          trying to look relaxed. Alex comes up behind her.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I had no idea it would be such a
                    madhouse.

          
          Gigi turns to him and smiles.

          

                                  GIGI
                    Hey.   Great party.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need
                    me to evaluate their level of interest?

          

                                 GIGI
                    They were gay. Even I know that their
                    level of interest was probably low.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it. I
                    still think you guys would hit it off.

          
          Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Oh OK.  Right.
                           (air quotes)
                    "Bill".

          
          Alex doesn't know how to take that.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some
                    more liquor. But it looks like the food
                    could use some refreshing --

          
          He looks at the FOOD TABLE.     Everything is empty.

          

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Would you mind helping? I mean, just
                    refill the chips and stuff?

          

                                 GIGI
                    You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting?

          
          Gigi LOOKS ELATED.   Alex looks CONFUSED.

          

          

          

          

                                     82

                                  ALEX
                    Uhh, OK.   The chips are on top of the
                    fridge.

          
          He walks away.   Gigi smiles BIG.

          

          INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER


          
          The party is now even more crowded. Gigi weaves her way
          through the crowd. She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS,
          passing them off to various people as she walks.

          
          She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls.

          
          She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to
          friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an
          awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.

          

          INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER


          
          Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats
          with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home.

          

                                 PARTY-GOER #1
                    Really great party.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have
                    a party, I was like "Let's do it."

          

                                 PARTY-GOER #2
                    Thanks so much for having us.

          

                                  GIGI
                    No problem.   Anytime.

          
          An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts
          LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Can I help you find something?

          
          The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it.

          

                                 TALL GIRL
                    No, that's OK. I got it.

          
          She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts
          emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN.

          

                                 TALL GIRL (CONT'D)
                    Thanks for mixing that up.

          

          

          

                                     83

          

          7/20/7                                                   84.

          

          

          

                                   GIGI
                    What?

          

                                 TALL GIRL
                    Alex asked me to get the dip together.
                    Thanks for getting it started.

          
          Gigi's face grows red.   The Tall Girl tastes the dip.

          

                                 TALL GIRL (CONT'D)
                    Hmmm - could use a little more dill.

          
          Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and
          heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused
          party-goers, not pleased.

          

          INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATER


          
          Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are
          getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.

          
          Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.

          

                                 GIGI
                    When someone's underwear ends up in your
                    toaster oven - it's been a good party.

          
          Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.

          

                                 ALEX
                    I guess people had fun.

          
          Then, the TALL GIRL emerges.

          

                                 TALL GIRL
                    Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?

          
          Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.

          

                                 GIGI
                    That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd
                    stick around, so I'll take care of it.

          

                                  TALL GIRL
                    No.   I got it.

          
          The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a
          trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Knock yourselves out.

          

          

          

          

                                     84

          

          7/20/7                                                  85.

          

          

          

          INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - STILL LATER


          
          It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL
          GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on
          the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I think I've rounded up the last of the
                    beer bottles.

          
          The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game.
          Gigi stands there awkwardly.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    So, umm - what game is this?

          
          They ignore her.   She looks around.    It's awkward.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Well, maybe I should just -- you know --
                    I mean it's past three and --

          

                                   TALL GIRL
                    YES!!    Suck it!

          
          Alex tosses down his controller.

          

                                 ALEX
                    You are sensational.

          
          The tall girl beams.   Gigi flinches.

          

                                 TALL GIRL
                    Did you say it's past three?     Man, I
                    gotta go.

          
          Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug,
          and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next
          to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Thanks for staying and helping clean up
                    - but I really gotta get to bed.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Is that an invitation?

          

                                  ALEX
                    What?

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'm sorry. That was cheesy.      I'm not
                    good at this.

          

          

                                     85

          

          7/20/7                                                 86.

          

          

          
          But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is
          LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and
          starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi
          pulls away. She looks breathless.

          

                                   GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Yes!

          
          Alex looks a little afraid.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    I knew it. I knew it. The best
                    relationships grow out of friendships.

          
          She goes in to kiss him again.   This time he stops her.

          

                                   ALEX
                    Wait - what?

          

                                   GIGI
                    Ummmm....

          

                                 ALEX
                    Now you and I are in a relationship?

          

                                 GIGI
                    Well, I'd say if we're not at
                    relationship station--ship, we're at
                    least on the track.

          
          Alex gets up off the couch.

          

                                 ALEX
                    And why would you think that, exactly?

          

                                 GIGI
                    Because there were - you know - signs.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Really?   Like what?

          

                                 GIGI
                    Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You
                    talked to me even when you were with a
                    girl. I felt something...

          
          She trails off.   Alex is not pleased.

          

                                 ALEX
                    What are you talking about? What have I
                    been saying since I met you? If a guy
                    wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

                    HE WILL ASK YOU OUT. DID I ASK YOU OUT?

          

          

                                     86

          

          7/20/7                                                87.

          

          

          

                                 GIGI

                           (SOFTLY)
                    No.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Why would you do this?

          

                                 GIGI
                    I thought you were Watts.

          
          Alex doesn't even hear her.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Why do women do this? Why do they build
                    this stuff up in their minds, take each
                    little thing a guy does and twist it into
                    something else --

          
          Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating.

          

                                 GIGI
                    I'd rather be like that - than like you.

          

                                 ALEX
                    Excuse me?

          

                                 GIGI
                    Maybe I dissect each little thing, and
                    put myself out there too much, and maybe
                    I even thrive on the drama of it all--
                    but at least that means I still care.
                    You think you've won because women are
                    expendable to you? Sure, you don't get
                    hurt or make an ass of yourself that way,
                    but you don't fall in love that way,
                    either. You haven't won, Alex. You're
                    alone.

          
          Gigi grabs her bag.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    I may do a lot of stupid shit - but I
                    know I'm a lot closer to finding someone
                    than you are.

          
          Gigi turns and heads out the door.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT


          
          Gigi looks at the phone, and then finally DIALS.

                                 GIGI
                    Hey Janine, I'm sorry it's so late, but I
                    just - don't start picking out your
                    bridesmaid dress, OK? I know this isn't
                    the first time this has happened, it's
                    just - this one wasn't about whether he
                    liked me. I just really liked him.

          
          Gigi hangs up, lays on the bed, snaps off the light.

          

          INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DAY


          
          Ken Murphy, Beth's dad, lies in bed, in a Notre Dame
          sweatshirt, with papers, and books surrounding him. Beth
          clears his breakfast dishes off of the bed.

          

                                 BETH
                    You want anything else?

          

                                KEN
                    Yeah. Less of that cardboardy brown
                    stuff. More regular people food.

          

                                 BETH
                    The cardboardy brown stuff is called
                    whole grain bread.

          

                                 KEN
                    Maybe you could just fry me up a couple
                    sausage links?

          

                                 BETH
                    People who have just had heart attacks
                    generally are not advised to eat animal
                    fat, stuffed in synthetic casings.

          
          Ken looks at her, with a wry smile.

          

                                 KEN
                    Did I tell you that you're not only my
                    favorite daughter, but you're also the
                    prettiest? So much better looking than
                    those other dogs. Seriously.

          

                                 BETH
                    It's not gonna work this time.   But I
                    appreciate the effort.

          
          Beth takes his dirty dishes and heads for the door.

          Beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den
          where Steven, Laura's husband, is on the couch, intently
          watching the golf channel.

          

                                 STEVEN
                    Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer if you're
                    going that way?

          
          Beth rolls her eyes.

          

                                 STEVEN (CONT'D)
                    And a little plate of cold cuts if there
                    are any left?

          
          Beth just keeps on walking.

          

          INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME


          
          Beth walks by Paige, on the couch, and DEVON, Paige's new
          husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of VINYL
          RECORDS. He has an old BOBBY DARIN tune BLARING.

          

                                 BETH
                    You might wanna kill the volume just a
                    smidge. My mom is finally taking a nap.

          

                                 DEVON
                    You think your dad really wants to hang
                    on to all this vinyl? My collection
                    could use a bunch of these.

          

                                 BETH
                    Turn it the fuck down.

          
          Both Devon and Paige look at her, stunned.

          

          INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME


          
          The kitchen is a total MESS. Beth sets the dishes down
          in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her
          sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table.

          

                                 BETH
                    I finally got mom to lay down in the
                    spare room. All we have left to eat is
                    some old jelly and ramen noodles, so
                    after I tackle some of these dishes,
                    maybe we can go to the store. Our new
                    brother is trying to co-opt dad's
                    property before he's even dead.

                                 BETH (CONT'D)
                    And Laura, your husband would really like
                    a beer to go with his fifth consecutive
                    hour of the golf channel.

          
          Beth looks up. Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has
          her head in her hands. She's CRYING SOFTLY.

          

                                    BETH (CONT'D)
                    It's OK.     It's all gonna be OK.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    What am I gonna do without dad?

          

                                 BETH
                    First of all, he's upstairs watching
                    'Oprah After The Show'.

          

                                 LAURA
                    And second of all - you have us.

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    But he's always been - the one who's
                    there for me.

          

                                 BETH
                    What about your husband?    Where the hell
                    is he?

          

                                 CATHERINE
                    Playing ultimate frisbee.    His team may
                    make the quarterfinals.

          
          Beth rolls her eyes.    The DISHES crash in the sink.

          

          INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY


          
          Janine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares
          at her in disbelief. Janine fiddles with a TILE SAMPLE.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Do you know who it is?

          

                                 JANINE
                           (shaking her head "no")
                    It doesn't matter.

          

                                 GIGI
                    So are you going to - leave - him?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Gigi, he's my husband. He's not just
                    some guy that didn't call me back. And
                    he did admit it to me. He didn't wait to
                    get caught. That takes courage.

          

          

                                      90

          Gigi is clearly STUNG.

          

                                  JANINE (CONT'D)
                     I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.     I know
                     Alex was not just some guy.

          

                                   GIGI
                     It's OK.

          

                                  JANINE
                     It's my fault, you know.

          

                                   GIGI
                     What?

          

                                  JANINE
                     I'm willing to accept my responsibility
                     in this. I forced him into getting
                     married. He wasn't ready.

          

                                  GIGI
                     Janine - this is not your fault.

          

                                 JANINE
                     It is.  I've - changed. I used to be
                     fun. I was fun when we met.

          

                                  GIGI
                     You're still fun.

          
          A BEAT.   Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come.

          

                                  JANINE
                     We never have sex anymore.

          

                                  GIGI
                     Lots of couples got through lulls.

          

                                  JANINE
                     No. We never have sex. Realistically,
                     what did I expect him to do?

          

                                  GIGI
                     I don't think that's really --

          
          She looks down at the TILE in her hand.

          

                                  JANINE
                     This is too small. I gotta tell Javier.

          

                                   GIGI
                     What?

          

          

          

                                     91

                                 JANINE
                    This tile. I gotta go.    Tell Beth I took
                    a personal day.

          
          Janine grabs her purse, heads out as Gigi looks on.

          

          FADE TO CARD: ...IF HE'S SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE ELSE

          
          MARIEL (50's, highly manicured, upper class type) sits on
          a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera.

          

                                 MARIEL
                    My first husband was unimpressive. I
                    found him in bed with his big breasted
                    secretary when I came home early from the
                    Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel
                    sorry for him. My second husband was a
                    pinch more creative. Cheated on me with
                    my sister - but made me believe that I
                    was insane for being suspicious. At last
                    - some intrigue, some mind games - though
                    my sister's two year old eventually gave
                    them up. But my last husband -- he was a
                    gem. A veritable master at covering his
                    tracks. I poured over his phone records,
                    intercepted his credit card bills, had
                    him followed on countless occasions - and
                    never found a single shred of evidence.
                    It wasn't until he died that I found out
                    about the property he owned with his
                    Austrian mistress. But the real master,
                    I have to say -- is me. Three husbands --
                    countless boyfriends, and I haven't been
                    caught yet.

          

          INT. LAW OFFICES - HALLWAY -   EVENING


          
          Anna SQUEEZES Ben's hand as they stride down the hallway
          to his office. Anna is trying to suppress a smile.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god...

          
          Ben smoothly EXTRICATES his hand from Anna's.   He nods to
          COWORKERS as they pass.

          

                                 BEN
                    It was all you, babe.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.

          Ben smiles at Anna, as they round the corner of the
          corridor to his office. He goes in, and she follows.

          

          INT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING


          
          Ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them.

          

                                    ANNA

                    OH.    MY.   GOD.

          

                                 BEN
                    This is really good news.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I cannot believe this. He liked my demo.
                    Did you hear what he said? When he said
                    it was hauntingly beautiful? Did you
                    hear that part?

          

                                   BEN
                    Yep.    I was sitting right there.

          
          Ben smiles, and pulls Anna to him.

          

                                    ANNA
                    Thank you.     Thank you so much.

          
          With that, they start to KISS. It gets heated. CLOTHES
          START TO COME OFF. MOSTLY ANNA'S. They make their way
          over to the LEATHER SOFA.

          

                                 BEN
                    How is it that every time I see your
                    body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?

          
          Anna smiles at the compliment. She starts to work on his
          shirt when: SOMEONE TRIES TO OPEN THE LOCKED DOOR.

          

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                    Dana, I need to go over the offering
                    statement. Can I get a few minutes?

          
          Ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks.

          

                                 JANINE (O.S.)
                    It's not Dana.

          
          BEN FREEZES.    Literally freezes on top of Anna.

          

                                   ANNA
                    Is -

          

          

          

          

                                      93

          Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then,
          working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF
          ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET.
          There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She
          looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.

          
          He goes to the door of the office.

          

                                BEN
                    Shit. I told Dana to get this lock
                    fixed. One sec.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Why do you even lock it?

          
          Ben re-buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over.

          

                                 BEN
                    I'd never get anything done if I didn't.

          
          Finally, Ben opens the door, and Janine is standing
          there, smiling.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Can I come in?

          

                                 BEN
                    Of course.

          
          She makes a show of CLOSING AND LOCKING THE DOOR.

          

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                    What are you doing?

          

                                 JANINE
                    Sit down.

          
          Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.

          

                                 BEN

                    OK.

          
          Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at
          his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so
          she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances
          over at the closet.

          

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                    Janine, what are you doing?

          

                                 JANINE
                    I don't know. I just thought - maybe we
                    could, you know, relight the fire.

                                 BEN
                    Honey, did you hear what I just said? I
                    gotta get this offering statement out.

          
          Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.

          

                                 JANINE
                    Look, I am trying here. Do you want to
                    save our marriage or don't you?

          
          Janine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT.

          

          INT. BEN'S OFFICE - CLOSET - SAME


          
          Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely.

          

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                    Of course I do.

          

                                 JANINE (O.S.)
                    Then you'll let me do this.

          
          Then a ZIPPER OPENING, a chair CREAKING -

          

                                 JANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                    Yeah, just like that, yeah...

          
          We HOLD ON Anna as she sits there, stonefaced.

          

          INT. RED MAPLE - BAR - EARLY EVENING


          
          Alex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre-
          shift meeting. He consults a clipboard as he talks.

          

                                 ALEX
                    OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and
                    pitch in with the servers when you -

          

                                 TYRONE
                    No...I'm on 8 thru 10. I'm always on 8
                    through 10. Been working here 18 months
                    doing 8 through 10.

          

                                  ALEX
                    Right.   Luis you take 4 through 6.

          
          The staff looks at each other - perplexed.

          

                                   TYRONE
                    Dude.    Luis quit like 10 months ago.

          
          Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's
          looking for. He slams his clipboard on the bar.

          

          

                                     95

          

          7/20/7                                                 96.

          

          

          

                                 ALEX
                    Do we even need to have this meeting?
                    Seriously? Does this serve any purpose?

          
          The group voice their opinions - a resounding "NO".

          

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Good.   Great. Get to work.

          
          The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.   He sees
          Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her.

          

                                 ALEX (CONT'D)
                    Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me?

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    Since you asked me 11 minutes ago?   No,
                    not a lot of phone traffic.

          
          Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his
          cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a
          beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again -
          staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down
          again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face.

          

                                 KELLI ANN (CONT'D)
                    Oh my god.

          

                                 ALEX
                    What?

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    It's happened to you.

          

                                 ALEX
                    What has happened to me?

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    What's her name?

          

                                 ALEX
                    Who?

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    The girl, Alex.

          

                                 ALEX
                    There's no girl.

          
          Alex takes his beer and heads down the bar.

                                 KELLI ANN
                    You can't hide it man. I know strung out
                    and you are strung - out.

          

                                   ALEX
                    Please -

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    This is amazing. Can't focus, right?
                    Jumping every time your phone rings,
                    checking your email 100 times a day.
                    Wishing you could write songs. Feeling
                    the need to bring up her name in random
                    conversations...

          
          Alex stops at the office door.

          

                                 KELLI ANN (CONT'D)
                    It's always the same. And it has
                    happened to you, my friend. Trust me.

          
          Alex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in.

          

                                   ALEX
                    Shit.

          
          Kelli Ann smiles, and as she walks away -

          

                                 KELLI ANN
                    Welcome to my world asshole.

          
          Alex takes this in, KNOWING SHE'S RIGHT.

          

          INT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING


          
          Janine, now fully dressed, hovers by the door.       Ben is
          back at his desk, eyes on his computer.

          

                                 JANINE
                    You sure I can't interest you in a little
                    beef and broccoli? I'm treating.

          

                                 BEN
                    I really gotta get this stuff done.

          
          Janine is clearly flailing.      She starts to go.

          

                                  JANINE
                    OK.   I'll see you at home.     I love you.

          
          She looks at Ben.    He has no choice.

          

          

          

          

                                      97

          

          7/20/7                                                    98.

          

          

          

                                 BEN
                           (covering his anger)
                    I love you too.

          
          Janine leaves. As soon as she's gone, Ben gets up, shuts
          the office door - and goes to the closet - when the door

          FLIES OPEN IN HIS FACE - NEARLY SMASHING HIM.

          

                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                    I had no choice. What was I supposed to
                    do when she -

          

                                 ANNA
                    You make me sick to my stomach.    You are
                    a disgusting excuse for a man -

          
          Anna pulls her clothes back on in a FURY.

          

                                 BEN
                    I didn't want to do it, Anna. You know
                    that it's you I want to be with -

          
          He puts out a hand to try to touch her.    She RECOILS.

          

                                 ANNA
                    Are you kidding me? You will never lay a
                    hand on me again. I may just be a piss
                    poor girl from Dundalk who works at a gym
                    - but I am so too good for you.

          
          Anna storms out.

          

          INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
          Gigi sits on her couch, a pile of BILLS in her lap - most
          of which say LATE, OVERDUE, etc. She's on the PHONE.

          

                                 GIGI
                    Dino, thank you again for letting me pay
                    over the phone. I assure you this late
                    payment thing will never happen again.
                    Yep -- just trying to trim some of the
                    drama out of my life.

          

          A CALL WAITING BEEP.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    That's my other line.   OK.     B-bye.

          
          Gigi CLICKS OVER.

          

                                 GIGI (CONT'D)
                    Hello?

          

          

                                    98

                                   MANS' VOICE
                    Hi, Gigi.    This is Bill.

          

                                    GIGI
                    Ummm -

          

                                 BILL
                    Alex's friend. We were supposed to meet
                    up - but Alex told me the wrong day.

          
          Gigi lets this sink in.

          

                                   GIGI
                    Bill.    So you do exist.

          

                                 BILL
                    I do. And I'd love to buy you dinner
                    sometime if you're game.

          

                                    GIGI
                    Yes.    Sure.   Why not?

          
          She puts on a smile.

          

          INT. DUNDALK HOUSE - DAY


          
          Anna stands in the cluttered kitchen of her mom's house.
          She writes out a CHECK, leaves it on the counter. She
          looks to the living room, where Maya sleeps on the couch.
          She watches her for a second, struggling with a blanket,
          before heading over to her. She crouches next to the
          couch, helps her adjust the blanket.

          

                                 ANNA
                    I'm gonna go. I left the check on the
                    counter. It should at least get you
                    through this month.

          
          Maya opens her eyes and looks up at her, smiling.

          

                                 MAYA
                    Thanks sweetie. I don't know what I
                    would do without you.

          
          Maya closes her eyes again. Anna sits there, watching
          her. Anna's eyes start to fill with tears - quietly, she
          begins crying. Maya finally notices.

          

                                 MAYA (CONT'D)
                    Baby - what's the matter?

          
          Maya struggles to sit up and hug her. Anna sits next to
          her on the couch, still trying to get it together.

          

          

                                      99

          

          7/20/7                                                 100.

          

          

          

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                     Is it money? Because you can take back
                     the check if -

          

                                  ANNA
                     No, it's not that. I mean - yes, I'm
                     broke - but it's not that. It's just -
                            (tearing up again)
                     I'm just so lost mom. I've been seeing
                     this guy - who is exciting and amazing
                     and thoroughly unavailable. I thought he
                     was - the one - but he turned out to be
                     such an asshole.

          
           Maya nods, almost smiling.

          

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                     And then there's -

          

                                  MAYA
                     Conor -

          

                                  ANNA
                     Yeah. Who I'm so horrible to. But he
                     takes it. And he's - there. Waiting.
                     But I just don't want to - I don't know -

          

                                   MAYA
                     Settle?   Like you think I did?

          
           Anna looks at her mother, guilty.

          

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                     Well, your father and I had a glorious
                     life together.

          

                                  ANNA
                     Are you kidding? All you talk about are
                     the things you didn't do, the people you
                     wish you could have been with, the Tim
                     Buckleys - anything but the life you
                     actually had.

          
           Maya looks at her daughter.

          

                                  MAYA
                     Those are just dreams Anna.

          
           Anna tries to process this.

          

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                     Now true - I did not like your father at
                     all when we met.

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                     Or after we got married for that matter.
                     But let me tell you this - life with him
                     was a hell of a lot better than life is
                     without him.

          
           Maya stands, walks slowly toward the kitchen.

          

                                  MAYA (CONT'D)
                     There are worse things in life than
                     settling.

          

                                  ANNA
                     Like what?

          

                                  MAYA
                     Like wishing you had.

          
           Anna considers this.

          

           INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
           Anna lays on her bed, staring at the ceiling.

          
           The doorbell RINGS, Anna gets up to answer it. Almost as
           soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the
           middle of her studio apartment. He is all amped up.

          

                                  ANNA
                     Hey, sweetie.

          
           She reaches up to give him a hug, he doesn't go for it.

          

                                  CONOR
                     See, why did you call me sweetie?

          
           Anna looks confused.

          

                                  ANNA
                     Because we always call each other that.

          

                                  CONOR
                     Why?

          
           Anna doesn't have an answer for that.

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                     I want to say something, OK? I mean, we
                     call each other sweetie, and we fall
                     asleep on the phone after talking for
                     hours and I washed your hair for you
                     after you had that shoulder surgery and
                     everything - it's like we're together.

                                   ANNA
                      I know that I -

          

                                   CONOR
                      Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault.
                      Maybe I haven't been clear about what I
                      want. So let me be clear. I love
                      hanging out, but I am so attracted to
                      you, and I just - I want both. I want to
                      make love to you. I know that sounds
                      kind of embarrassing coming out of my
                      mouth - I just freaked myself out, too -
                      but it's true. And I'm not sure what
                      happened, or why we stopped - but I don't
                      really care. I just --

          

                                   ANNA

                      OK.

          
           Conor is STUNNED.

          

                                   CONOR
                      What?

          

                                   ANNA

                      OK.

          

                                   CONOR
                      I'm talking about really doing this.
                      Like a full-on relationship.

          

                                   ANNA
                      Right.

          

                                   CONOR
                      With me.

          
           She LAUGHS.

          

                                   ANNA
                      Yes.

          

                                   CONOR
                      Did a bunch of gay people put you up to
                      this?

          

                                   ANNA
                      Please stop talking.

          
           He does.   They KISS.

           INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER


          
           Conor sleeps peacefully with his limbs wrapped around
           Anna. Anna lays on her back, eyes wide open, STARING AT
           THE CEILING. She's clearly not at peace.

          

           INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DEN - DAY


          
           All of Beth's sister's spouses - Steven, Devon and George
           - sit on the couch watching basketball.

          

                                    DEVON
                     Shit!    Take him out.   He's done.

          

                                   GEORGE
                     Jesus.   This isn't some exhibition game.

          
           Beth comes downstairs, with another set of dirty dishes,
           and walks past them to the kitchen. The guys are annoyed
           that she blocks their view.

          

                                    STEVEN
                     Could you --

          

                                  BETH
                     Did anyone have time to run to the store?

          

                                  GEORGE
                     Nah, we're good. We just got drive
                     through.

          

                                  BETH
                     I didn't mean for you.

          
           Beth, annoyed, goes into the kitchen. She puts down the
           dishes in shock. The kitchen is SPOTLESS.

          
           She looks to the sink and sees the back of a man, doing
           the last of the dishes. He turns around. It's NEIL.

          

                                  NEIL
                     The dishes are all put away. There's a
                     load of laundry still drying, but the
                     other one is folded on top of the washer.

          
           He goes to the fridge, and OPENS it.    It's STOCKED.

          

                                  NEIL (CONT'D)
                     I remembered what your dad likes, but I
                     tried to get healthy stuff, too.

          
           Beth just looks at Neil, stunned.

                                      NEIL (CONT'D)
                       Ben told me.    I just - I wanted to help.

          
           With that, TEARS start to roll out of Beth's eyes.         Neil
           goes to her, and puts his arms around her.

          

                                    NEIL (CONT'D)
                       I know how much you love him.      But it's
                       gonna be OK.

          

           EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON


          
           Janine pulls up in her Land Rover and gets out. As she
           approaches the house, she stops in her tracks. ALL THE
           SCAFFOLDING IS GONE. THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. She
           whips out her cell phone and dials.

          

                                    JANINE
                       Javier - does this mean what I think it
                       means? So when you say "done" - you
                       don't mean "we still need plumbing in the
                       upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done
                       done"?...Wow - you're amazing...OK...I'll
                       call when I see it...Bye.

          
           She hangs up the phone, steels herself, and walks inside.

          

           INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME


          
           As Janine enters - she can't believe her eyes.

          
           VARIOUS SHOTS as Janine walks from room to room - amazed.
           Where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls
           with vintage wall paper. All the floors are immaculate,
           the chandeliers sparkle - it's all perfect.

          
           She walks down halls and up staircases, past end tables
           and mantles - ALL COVERED WITH PICTURES OF HER AND BEN.
           Nice and tasteful.

          
           She ends her tour in the master suite - it's HUGE. And
           though full of furniture, the longer she stands there,
           the more empty it begins to seem. Her face transitions,
           from delight to loneliness, within a matter of seconds.

          
           She takes out her cell phone, hesitates, then dials...

          

           EXT. MEADOW MILL ATHLETIC CLUB - SAME


          

           CLOSE ON:   A LIT CIGARETTE.       A LONG DRAG IS TAKEN.

           CUT WIDE TO REVEAL: Ben sitting on a ledge in front of
           the gym, smoking a cigarette, watching the passersby.
           He's clearly waiting for Anna to arrive.

          
           His PHONE RINGS. He looks at it - JANINE CALLING. He
           IGNORES the call, takes another drag of his cigarette.

          

           INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME


          
           With Janine as the call goes to voice mail. She hangs
           up, confused. She sits on the edge of the bed, looking
           around the room, not sure what to do with herself.

          
           She notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a
           chair - goes to tidy it up. She picks up the jacket,
           checks the pockets, they're empty. She grabs the pants,
           takes them both to the walk-in closet. She hangs up the
           jacket. And as she folds the pants over - she HEARS
           SOMETHING HIT THE GROUND. She looks down to find -

          
           A PACK OF CIGARETTES. Her face pales. She stares at it -
           immobile. Her face tightens, her eyes well up.

          

                                  JANINE

                     YOU LYING SACK OF SHIT!

          
           - as she grabs two armfuls of his clothes off the racks
           and flies out of the closet.

          
           STAIRCASE - She hurtles down the stairs, throwing armfuls
           of clothes into the foyer. Then, she surveys the scene
           and, not satisfied, rushes back up the stairs.

          
           HALLWAY - As she flies back into the bedroom, she sees
           herself in the ANTIQUE MIRROR hanging in the hallway.

          
           Without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and
           SMASHES IT on the ground. She stands over it, breathing
           heavily, looking at the shattered glass.

          
           She EXITS FRAME and we hear her walk down the stairs, the
           camera HOLDING ON THE EMPTY WALL.

          
           After a beat we hear her walking back up the stairs - she
           ENTERS FRAME AGAIN holding a DUSTPAN AND BROOM. She
           kneels over and begins sweeping up her mess.

          

           INT. BOAT - DAY


          
           Neil lies on the bed, reading. The room is pretty messy -
           a lot of clothes strewn around. There is a KNOCK at the
           door. Neil gets up to answer it. It's Beth.

                                  BETH
                     It's been a while since I've been here.
                     Turns out - that boat in the next
                     mooring, looks like yours -- not yours.

          

                                  NEIL
                     Oh no.

          

                                  BETH
                     No, it's no problem. Nice guy. Invited
                     me in for a white wine spritzer. Not
                     sure he gets a lot of visitors.

          
           Neil laughs.

          

                                  BETH (CONT'D)
                     Can I come in?

          
           Neil ushers her in, shuts the door.    Beth looks around.

          

                                  BETH (CONT'D)
                     I wanted to thank you. For coming by my
                     folks' house.

          

                                  NEIL
                     Of course. I really care about your dad.
                     And I really love you. Even if I can't
                     give you what you want.

          

                                  BETH
                     You're what I want.

          
           Neil looks at her - unsure of her meaning.

          

                                  BETH (CONT'D)
                     Our life together is what I want. Your
                     love is what I want. Did you see those
                     guys my sisters are married to? You are
                     a better husband to me - without being
                     married - than any of those real husbands
                     will ever be. And that's enough for me.

          

                                  NEIL
                     And you'd really be OK if we take the
                     marriage thing off the table?

          

                                  BETH
                     If you promise to love me and be
                     committed to me -

          7/20/7                                                107.

          

          

          

                                  NEIL
                     I always have -

          

                                  BETH
                     Wait, I'm not done. And snake the shower
                     drain when my hair clogs it, and let me
                     eat Wheat Thins in bed.

          

                                   NEIL
                     I do.

          
           Beth smiles.   They KISS.

          

                                  NEIL (CONT'D)
                     So, I get to move back in?

          

                                   BETH
                     I guess.   But, you cannot bring those.

          
           She points to his pants - a RAGGEDY pair of CARGO PANTS.

          

                                  NEIL
                     What? You're just mad at me, and you're
                     taking it out on the pants.

          

                                  BETH
                     Look, I gotta win something. I let you
                     win the big battle, so throw me a bone.

          

                                  NEIL
                     OK. We're not getting married, but I'm
                     chucking the pants.

          

                                   BETH
                     Great.   We both win.

          
           They kiss AGAIN.

          

           INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON


          
           Gigi sits on her bed, head flung upside down, blow drying
           her hair. The phone RINGS but Gigi doesn't hear it.

          

           INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME


          
           Alex, in his office, paces as he talks into the phone.

          

                                  ALEX
                     Hey, Gigi. It's Alex. I was just
                     wondering how you were doing. It's been
                     a little while since we've talked -- and
                     I was wondering how you were doing.

           Alex looks up. Tyrone is watching him, shaking his head.
           Alex motions for Tyrone to leave. He doesn't.

          

                                  ALEX (CONT'D)
                     Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you.
                     Obviously. But you're out. So, call me.
                     Sometime. Or tonight. I'm around. OK.
                     That's enough now. It's Alex.

          
           He hangs up.   Tyrone is unimpressed.

          

                                   TYRONE
                     Dude.

          

                                   ALEX
                     I know.   I know.

          

           INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - SAME


          
           Gigi flips her head back - oblivious to the phone call -
           and checks her hair. She heads out of the bedroom.

          

           EXT. ROWHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON


          
           Conor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row
           house. A "FOR SALE" sign is outside.

          

                                  ANNA
                     You seriously get a ton of people bidding
                     on this?

          

                                  CONOR
                     I know it's crazy. But it's a
                     neighborhood "in transition."

          

                                  ANNA
                     So that means what - that hip gay people
                     want to live out here?

          

                                  CONOR
                     Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples,
                     young families.

          
           Conor smiles as Anna heads into the house.

          

           INT. ROWHOUSE - CONTINUOUS


          

                                  ANNA
                     Weird - it totally reminds me of the
                     house I grew up in. I bet there is a -

          
           Anna goes into a little nook off of the kitchen.   And
           pulls down a BUILT IN IRONING BOARD.

          

          

                                     108

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                     We totally had this same thing. My mom
                     would use this as her 'desk'. Isn't that
                     bizarre? It was always covered with her
                     little coupons and stuff.

          
           Anna looks up to Conor, who is just watching her.

          

                                  ANNA (CONT'D)
                     So, when do all the fabulous homosexual
                     couples start arriving?

          

                                  CONOR
                     Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I
                     have this one buyer. I mean, I want to
                     see if his girlfriend likes it first -

          

                                  ANNA
                     His girlfriend?

          

                                  CONOR
                     I mean, I had this idea -

          
           Conor looks - all of a sudden - to be sweating.

          

                                  ANNA
                     An idea for the open house?

          

                                  CONOR
                     No, an idea. For this house. For - me.
                     To buy. And hopefully, if you like it
                     and things continue to - you know...

          
           Anna turns to face Conor, trying to put this together.

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                     Anna, look. I have a plan. I know where
                     my life is going. And I want you to go
                     with me. I mean - I'm not saying you
                     have to move in now or anything - I just -
                     I don't want to buy a place that you
                     couldn't - at some point - see yourself
                     moving into.

          
           Conor takes her hands in his.   Anna starts to PANIC.

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                     So what do you think? I mean gut
                     reaction. I always go with my gut when
                     it comes to real estate or ---

          

          

          

          

                                    109

          

          7/20/7                                                    110.

          

          

          
           Anna looks at him. And at the PULL DOWN IRONING BOARD.
           She looks at the ironing board a long time, before
           turning back to Conor, holding back tears.

          

                                  ANNA
                     I can't do this Conor.

          

                                   CONOR
                     OK.   If it's too fast -

          

                                  ANNA
                     No. I mean this. Any of this. What
                     you're saying - what you're offering - is
                     what every girl wants. It's what I've
                     always wanted. It's just -

          
           Anna looks at him for a long time, not knowing how to say
           this. Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees
           it in her face. The answer he's been looking for. It
           all dawns on him in an instant.

          

                                  CONOR
                     You don't want it with me.

          
           Anna NODS sadly.   Conor takes this in.   A LONG BEAT.

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                     So, I have a question.

          

                                   ANNA
                     Okay.

          

                                  CONOR
                     Is it too late to dial it back to before -
                     and just keep sleeping together?

          
           Anna LAUGHS, and it breaks the tension.   Conor smiles.

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                     Because I thought that really -    you know
                     - gelled.

          
           Anna goes to Conor and HUGS him.

                     So, Alex told me you work in finance.

                     Yes.   Yes, I do. Finance.

          

           A LONG PAUSE.

                     This is nice.

          

                                  BILL
                     It is.

          

                                  GIGI
                     A nice evening. And you planned it. And
                     called me when you said you would. And
                     showed up on time. Thank you, Bill.

          

                                  BILL
                     You're very welcome.

          
           ANOTHER AWKWARD LONG SILENCE.    Gigi smiles.

          

           INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
           Alex now seems pretty agitated. He's shirtless, his
           hair's a disaster. He's holding his phone handset.
           Staring at it. He can't stop himself. He dials.

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     Hey it's Gigi. You've reached my cell.
                     I'm either having a very good time or in
                     a meeting - either way just leave a
                     message and --

          
           Alex hangs up. He stands there for a second, thinking.
           Then he runs into his bedroom like a madman.

                     It was nice meeting you.

                     Thank you for a lovely evening.

          

                                  GIGI
                     You, too.

          
           Bill reaches out for an ill timed hug.   It's awkward.

          

                                  GIGI (CONT'D)
                     Goodnight.

           INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
           She comes inside, drops her stuff and sits on the couch.
           Then, A KNOCK on the door. Gigi reluctantly gets up.

          

                                  GIGI
                     Did you forget something?

          
           She opens the DOOR.    It's not Bill.   It's ALEX.

          

                                   ALEX
                     Yeah.   I did.

          

                                     GIGI
                     Really?     What did you forget?

          

                                    ALEX
                     This.

          
           Alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a PEN. THE

           SAME PEN THAT GIGI PRETENDED TO BE RETURNING TO CONOR.
           Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE.

          

                                                                FADE OUT.

          

           INT. THE OWL BAR - NIGHT


          
           A speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. A
           PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then -
           a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front
           of the mic. And begins to SING.

          
           It's a "THE LAST GOODBYE" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely
           recognizable - more of a torch song. As she sings, she
           begins to gain confidence. We hear the song over:

          

           INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - DAY


          
           Beth and Neil's place. Neil comes in holding a few
           MESSILY PACKED BOXES. He is clearly moving back in.

          

                                  NEIL
                     How did all this stuff fit in here fine
                     before?

          
           Beth comes in after him, holding some of his clothes.

          

                                  BETH
                     I don't know. It expanded.

          
           Neil collapses on the couch. Beth sits next to him, a
           pile of clothes on her lap. She looks down and laughs.

                                  BETH (CONT'D)
                     No you are not trying to bring these back
                     in here -

          
           Beth holds the CARGO PANTS that she protested before.

          

                                    NEIL
                     What?    I have no idea what you're -

          

                                  BETH
                     We had a deal. These are not staying.

          

                                  NEIL
                     That's really gonna free up a lot of
                     space.

          

                                  BETH
                     They're going. I have a bag I'm taking
                     to the Goodwill.

          
           Neil watches her, smiling, as she walks across the room.

          

                                  NEIL
                     Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make
                     sure there's nothing in the pockets
                     before we give them away.

          
           Beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. And then
           she FEELS SOMETHING. Her face registers curiosity as she
           pulls out - A BLACK VELVET RING BOX. Beth looks at it,
           and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE.

          

                                  NEIL (CONT'D)
                     I love you so much. So much. I want to
                     make you happy. I need to make you happy
                     for me to even have a shot at being
                     happy, too.

          
           Tears stream down Beth's face.      Neil pops open the box,
           revealing an ENGAGEMENT RING.

          

                                  NEIL (CONT'D)
                     Will you marry me?

          
           Neil gets up and KISSES HER. They kiss, passionately,
           for a long moment. And then:

          

                                    BETH
                     Yes.    Of course, yes.

          

           INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT


          
           Gigi and Alex stand in her entry.     She holds the PEN.

                                     GIGI
                        You came all the way here - at 11 at
                        night - to give me back a promotional
                        pen?

          

                                     ALEX
                        I thought I better come up with some
                        excuse to get over here. Isn't that how
                        it's done?

          

                                     GIGI
                        Sometimes.

          
           Alex looks at Gigi for a long moment.    He looks nervous.

          

                                     ALEX
                        Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I
                        drive by your place. I call and hang up.
                        I'm turning into -

          

                                     GIGI
                        Me.

          
           He LAUGHS.

          

                                     ALEX
                        Yeah.

          

                                     GIGI
                        Well, a wise person once told me that if
                        a guy wants to be with a girl, he will
                        make it happen. No matter what.

          

                                     ALEX
                        True.

          

                                     GIGI
                        Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body
                        onto yours - you did not seem to want to
                        "make it happen."

          

                                     ALEX
                        Here's the thing about that. You were
                        right. I've gotten so used to keeping
                        myself at a safe distance from these
                        women, having the power - that I didn't
                        know what it felt like when I actually -
                        fell - for one of them.

          
           Gigi considers this.

          

          

          

          

                                       114

                                  GIGI
                     Look, I've just been out with your friend
                     Bill. And it just might be exactly what
                     I need. No drama. He calls. He does
                     what he says.

          

                                  ALEX
                     I could do that stuff too.

          

                                  GIGI
                     But you didn't. And that same wise
                     person told me that I am the rule. That
                     I have to stop thinking that every guy
                     will change - stop thinking that I will
                     be the --

          
           But before she can finish her sentence, Alex KISSES HER.

           A LONG, SLOW, PASSIONATE KISS.

          

                                  GIGI (CONT'D)
                     - that I will be the exception.

          
           Alex looks at her.

          

                                  ALEX
                     You are my exception.

          
           They continue to KISS.

          

           EXT. GAY PRIDE PARADE - NIGHT


          
           A staple of summer in Baltimore.

          
           The rickety Baltimore Blade float comes by. It's a very
           phallic "blade" with a A BUNCH OF YOUNG SHIRTLESS MEN
           dancing and waving. Mary rides the float, too, waving to
           the crowd with Nathan, Joshua and Bruce.

          
           Conor, with a NATTILY DRESSED GAY COUPLE, stands on the
           street watching. Nathan calls down from the float.

          

                                    NATHAN
                     Jonathan?

          

                                  NATTILY DRESSED GAY
                     What are you guys doing up there?

          

                                    NATHAN
                     Dancing.    Get your asses up here.

          
           With that, the two Nattily Dressed Gays grab Conor, and
           climb up onto the float. They SHOUT over the music.

          

          

          

                                      115

                                  NATTILY DRESSED GAY
                     This is Conor. He just sold us on the
                     most amazing duplex in Mt. Vernon.

          

                                    MARY
                     Hey, Conor.    I'm Mary.

          
           Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men
           around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.

          

                                  MARY (CONT'D)
                     It's so great to finally meet you in
                     person.

          

                                    CONOR
                     You, too.

          
           They look at each other.   Is there a connection?

          

                                  CONOR (CONT'D)
                     Would you like to dance?

          

                                    MARY
                     I'd love to.

          
           Conor takes her hand - and the two of them do an old
           fashioned slow dance on the float. As everyone freaks
           around them, they smile and dance in each others' arms.

          

           EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - NIGHT


          
           Ben walks into the house and looks around - no Janine.

          
           As he heads to the stairs, he stops in his tracks. At
           the bottom of the stairs - ALL OF HIS CLOTHES are
           stacked, neatly folded into piles. He approaches, then
           sees a CARTON OF CIGARETTES on top of one pile -

          

                                    BEN
                     Shit...

          
           - and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF

           OUT. - JANINE P.S. I WANT A DIVORCE.
           Ben slumps down, devastated.

           EXT. HARBOR - DAY


          
           A beautiful sunny day on the harbor. Anna's song fades
           out, and the sound of Gigi's voice fades up.

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing
                     up. If a guy punches you, he likes you.
                     Never try to trim your own bangs.

          

           EXT. BOAT - DAY


          
           Out on the sparkling water, Neil's boat. As we get
           closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. Even
           closer and we see - Beth on the arm of her father. He
           escorts her down a mini aisle. On the bough of the boat -

           INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY


          
           Mary sits at her desk, typing on her laptop.   ON THE

           SCREEN: MARY'S MYSPACE PROFILE.

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     Every movie we see, every story we're
                     told, implores us to wait for it. The
                     third act twist...the man who couldn't
                     get it together finally figuring it
                     out...the unexpected declaration of
                     love...

          
           Mary hits a button and a box comes up, which reads: ARE
           YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS MYSPACE PROFILE? Mary
           clicks "YES". MYSPACE PROFILE DELETED appears.

          
           Then, a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Mary gets up, grabs her
           little purse, and opens the door. IT'S CONOR. Mary
           smiles, her face barely able to contain her happiness.

          

           INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY


          
           Gigi and Alex sit close on her couch, watching a movie.

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     ...the exception to the rule.

          
           We PAN over to the TV to find that they are watching:
           SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. Watts and Keith finally KISS.
           Gigi can't suppress her smile as Alex pulls her close.

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     What we're not taught is how to read the
                     signs.

           INT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK - DAY


          
           Ben heads to the checkout line - holding a six pack of
           beer and a bag of chips. As he's about to put his stuff
           down, a PRETTY GIRL gets in line behind him.

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     How to tell the ones who want us from the
                     ones who don't. The one's who'll stay
                     from the one's who'll leave.

          
           He lets her go ahead of him. She smiles, takes him up on
           it. The cashier rings her up, she pays for her stuff,
           without giving Ben so much as a look. Ben gives his
           stuff to the cashier, along with a weak smile.

          

           EXT. BUTCHER'S HILL BROWNSTONE - EVENING


          
           From the outside looking in a ground floor window - we
           can see the living room of the lower apartment. Boxes
           fill the room - clearly a new tenant moving in.

          
           Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and
           pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     And ultimately, we're not taught the one
                     thing that could save ourselves, our
                     friends, our families countless hours of
                     confusion, despair, and speculation.

          
           She hangs the mirror, straightening it slightly. She
           steps back, seems pleased. Then, IN FRONT OF CAMERA walk
           two people - the CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM down the sidewalk.

          
           We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear
           it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an
           awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -

          

                                  NEW GUY
                     It was nice meeting you.

          
           Anna smiles - the New Guy turns and heads off. Anna
           watches him go, and then turns and walks away from us.

          

                                  GIGI (V.O.)
                     That sometimes the happy ending...is just
                     moving on.

          
           Anna walks down the hill, the skyline of Baltimore in
           front of her.

               EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY

               A garbage truck roars by and...

               Simon Grim hangs from the back of it. He is a shy, skinny 
               and terrified-looking guy around thirty years old.

               The truck rumbles to a halt and Simon climbs down off it to 
               go punch out at the time clock.

               EXT. BEHIND THE WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               He comes walking up a small alley and sits to drink his beer.

               He begins to relax. This is his quality private time.

               Then he hears something and looks up.

               He peeks up over the edge of some junked kitchen appliances 
               and sees...

               Two teenage kids -- Warren and Amy -- smoking crack and having 
               sex.

               Simon looks on, intrigued, as Warren smokes, then...

                                     WARREN
                              (to Amy)
                         You want some?

               Amy takes the pipe and smokes as he feels her up.

               Simon is fascinated. He drinks and looks on as...

               Amy grins up foolishly at Warren and lowers the pipe. The 
               boy undoes his belt and hikes up the girl's skirt.

               Simon can't believe this. He looks around to see if the coast 
               is clear, then returns just in time to see...

               Warren takes Amy by the waist and enter her.

               The pipe falls from the young girl's hand.

               Warren throws his head back and grinds himself into her.

               Simon's mouth falls open in awe.

               But Amy tosses her head back to the side and sees...

               The amazed garbage man; caught.

               Amy starts screaming insanely.

               Simon runs for his life.

               Amy and Warren throw rocks and bottles at him as they chase 
               him away.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Simon runs up and throws open the screen door. He stands 
               there in the doorway catching his breath.

               His sister, Fay, is at the kitchen table watching a small 
               portable TV while their mother, Mary, sits a few feet away 
               in the living-room watching another TV tuned to a different 
               channel.

                                     FAY
                              (to Simon)
                         Where the hell have you been?
                              (to Mary)
                         Mom, come on and eat.

                                     MARY
                         I'm not hungry.

                                     FAY
                              (pissed)
                         Then why'd I cook!

               Mary is a manic-depressive, still in her bathrobe at six in 
               the evening.

                                     MARY
                         I don't know why you cooked! I don't 
                         know why you bother!

               Fay holds her head in her hands and sighs. She glares at her 
               brother.

                                     FAY
                         Sit down and eat, Simon.

               Simon sits at the table and Fay slams down before him a bowl 
               of some sort of gruel. He hesitates, then lifts his spoon. 
               Supper is horrible and he screws up his face in disgust. Fay 
               gives him a sideways glance and he leans back down over the 
               bowl and eats some more.

               Pushing the bowl away gently, he reaches out for the container 
               of milk on the table and drinks straight from it.

               He suddenly jumps back and spits out sour milk all over the 
               table. The container drops to the floor and thick globs of 
               cheese roll out.

               He stands back against the fridge, holding his stomach 
               while...

               Fay and Mary look on in disgust.

               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Simon crosses the lawn and sits on the curb outside his house. 
               He stares at the ground before him as he holds his stomach 
               and spits, sickened.

               He looks up, though, and sees...

               A little seven-year-old girl -- Pearl age seven -- standing 
               there in the street watching him.

               Simon tries to smile at her.

               But she throws a rock at him and hits him in the head.

               He falls forward, hurt, as the little girl runs away. Lowering 
               his hand, he sees he's bleeding. Desperate, lonely and ill, 
               he drags his bloodied fingers across the coarse pavement.

               Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting 
               dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick.

                                     FAY
                         God, I wanna get fucked.

               Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs.

                                     FAY
                         You OK?

               Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks 
               back at his sister.

               Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off.

                                     FAY
                         See ya later.

               Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he 
               seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks 
               his head, sits perfectly still and listens.

               He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a 
               giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles.

               Titles begin.

               Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, 
               the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, 
               he focuses on...

               The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood.

               Music starts.

               He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the 
               pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on 
               the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of 
               the music over the scene.

               Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and...

               Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears...

               The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life.

               Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens 
               his eyes and sees...

               A man approaching. The music swells up full.

               Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in 
               wonder at...

               This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak 
               striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a 
               windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled 
               tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders.

               Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road.

               Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops.

               Titles finish.

               Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the 
               house.

               Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood 
               and then down at Simon.

                                     HENRY
                         Get up off your knees.

               He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off 
               towards his new home.

               EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to 
               his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying 
               the suitcases.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Moments later.

               The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw 
               by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs.

               Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the 
               main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair 
               and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove.

               Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually 
               quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon.

                                     HENRY
                         Where you gotta go to get a six-pack 
                         of beer around here?

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which 
               to eat donuts.

               Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the 
               Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the 
               safety of the counter.

                                     AMY
                         Say something.

                                     WARREN
                              (calling)
                         She's mute.

                                     AMY
                         What?

                                     WARREN
                         She don't -- you know -- talk.

               Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's 
               gaze to the door.

               Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his 
               tracks when he sees...

               Warren and Amy.

               He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler.

               Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple 
               of vampires.

               Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the 
               counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening.

               Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at...

               Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull.

               Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, 
               but...

               Warren shoves himself between it and Simon.

               Simon freezes. Warren is expressionless. Simon looks back at 
               Amy. She turns away, reaches up under her skirt, jerks down 
               her panties, then leans forward on to the counter. Leering 
               back over her shoulder, she hisses...

                                     AMY
                         Kiss my ass.

               Simon is nonplussed.

               Gnoc presses a button on the wall that sets...

               A red light flashing above the stockroom door.

               Warren grabs Simon by the neck and drags him over to Amy's 
               bare behind. Amy laughs as Simon is forced to his knees and 
               has his face shoved up right into the crack of her ass.

               But then... Simon throws up all over her.

               Warren falls back in disgust.

               Gnoc covers her face with her hands.

               Amy looks around at herself, realizes, and starts screaming 
               bloody murder.

               Simon falls back on to the floor, clutching his stomach, as 
               Amy staggers around with her vomit-strewn underwear down 
               around her ankles.

               Then Gnoc's father, Mr Deng, appears at the stockroom door 
               holding a shovel and ready to fight.

                                     WARREN
                              (scared)
                         Oh, shit!

               Mr Deng comes running at them and Warren drags Amy from the 
               store. Simon crawls out of the way as the old man throws 
               open the door to the parking lot and screams at the retreating 
               delinquents...

                                     MR DENG
                              (in Vietnamese)
                         Stay the hell out of my store, you 
                         good-for-nothing punks!

               Having scared them off, he comes back in and starts screaming 
               at Simon.

                                     MR DENG
                         Look at this! What's going on here? 
                         Simon, get up off the floor! Is this 
                         beer paid for?

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Later.

               Simon splashes water over his face at the kitchen sink, then 
               watches as Henry unpacks one of his suitcases. It is filled 
               with dozens of old, worn notebooks. Henry stacks them on the 
               mantelpiece over the fireplace; the fire is now crackling 
               and bright.

               Simon steps over and looks at...

               The name tag on the other suitcase: 'Henry Fool'.

                                     HENRY
                              (off-screen)
                         Centuries ago it had an 'e' at the 
                         end.

               Simon looks over and sees...

               Henry's silhouette against the fire. He steps forward into 
               the light and grabs a beer from the six-pack on the floor. 
               He hands one to Simon.

               Simon takes it and stares at it a moment before raising his 
               eyes to Henry.

                                     SIMON
                         Where do you come from?

                                     HENRY
                         Nowhere in particular.

               He winks at Simon, then struts around the room, hugely 
               impressed with himself.

                                     HENRY
                         I go where I will and I do what I 
                         must.
                              (stops, drinks)
                         That's why I'm in trouble. I'm sort've 
                         what you might call... 'in exile'.

                                     SIMON
                         Why are you in trouble?

                                     HENRY
                              (stopping)
                         An honest man is always in trouble, 
                         Simon. Remember that.

               Simon comes away from the fire, watching him carefully. Henry 
               stands in a dim corner across the room.

                                     SIMON
                         How do you know my name?

               Henry pauses, looks aside, drinks, then grins demoniacally. 
               He steps forward and comes face to face with Simon. He lifts 
               his finger and points to...

               Simon's name stitched upon the breast of his work shirt.

               Realizing this, Simon moves off and thinks.

               Henry throws more wood on the fire, glancing back over his 
               shoulder, laughing mischievously.

                                     SIMON
                              (stopping him)
                         I am not retarded.

                                     HENRY
                              (pauses)
                         Well... I'll take your word for that.

                                     SIMON
                              (explaining)
                         People. I mean. They think. You know. 
                         Because.

               He tries to articulate what he thinks he feels but winds up 
               gesticulating curiously with his hands. This finally dissolves 
               into a dumb stare into empty space.

                                     HENRY
                         I see.

               Simon looks at him. Henry stands and grabs a notebook from 
               off the mantelpiece. He tears out a few pages and shoves 
               them in his pocket. He hands the now fresh writing tablet to 
               Simon.

                                     HENRY
                         Here. Take this. And...

               He searches his pockets and finds a pencil.

                                     HENRY
                         ...this. Keep them with you at all 
                         times. You ever feel like you got 
                         something to say and you can't get 
                         it out, stop and write it down. OK?

               Simon hesitates, then accepts the gifts. Henry goes for 
               another beer while his new friend studies the dozens of 
               notebooks on the mantelpiece.

                                     SIMON
                         What are these?

                                     HENRY
                              (proudly, returning)
                         This? This is my life's work. My 
                         memoirs. My 'Confession'.

                                     SIMON
                              (carefully)
                         What have you done?

               Henry drinks and looks down into the raging fire.

                                     HENRY
                              (wistfully)
                         I've been bad. Repeatedly.
                              (shrugs and steps 
                              away)
                         But why brag? The details of my 
                         exploits are only a pretext for a 
                         far more expansive consideration of 
                         general truths.
                              (contemplating the 
                              notebooks)
                         What is this? It's a philosophy. A 
                         poetics. A politics, if you will. A 
                         literature of protest. A novel of 
                         ideas. A pornographic magazine of 
                         truly comic-book proportions. It is, 
                         in the end, whatever the hell I want 
                         it to be. And when I'm through with 
                         it, it's gunna blow a hole this wide 
                         straight through the world's own 
                         idea of itself!

               He smokes. Simon is impressed. They hear a bottle smash 
               outside in the street and Henry goes to the window. They're 
               throwing bottles at the house.

                                     HENRY
                              (throwing down his 
                              cigarette)
                         Come on, let's go break their arms!

               Simon jumps up.

                                     SIMON
                         No!

               Henry stops. Simon looks away and sits back down.

                                     SIMON
                              (pauses)
                         If I'm quiet.

               He is ashamed of himself.

               Henry sees this and settles down. He considers his new friend 
               with genuine care as he gets himself a new cigarette. He 
               lights up, thinks, then grabs another chair and sits close 
               by Simon. They sit there in silence a while, then...

                                     HENRY
                         Once. I forget where I was. Central 
                         America maybe. Somewhere hot. Stupid 
                         job. Bad pay. Dangerous location and 
                         water so foul the natives wouldn't 
                         even piss in it. This crowd of drunken 
                         motherfuckers hired by the local 
                         drug cartel shows up at my hotel 
                         room and threatens to tear me limb 
                         from limb. And I say, listen, hombres, 
                         OK, you've got me outnumbered four 
                         to one and you're gunna kill me here 
                         tonight and not a soul in this dimly 
                         lit world is ever gunna notice I'm 
                         gone. Fine. But one of you... one of 
                         you... one of you is gunna have his 
                         eye torn out. Period. Silence. I 
                         repeat myself. One of you poor, 
                         underpaid jerks is gunna have an eye 
                         ripped out of its socket. I promise. 
                         It's a small thing, perhaps, all 
                         things considered. But I will succeed. 
                         Because it's the only thing I have 
                         left to do in this world. So why 
                         don't you just take a good look at 
                         one another one last time and think 
                         it over for a few minutes more.
                              (smokes, waits)
                         They sober up a little, look at their 
                         shoes in confusion, then step out 
                         into the hall to talk among 
                         themselves.

               Henry stares into the flames and falls silent. Simon is 
               riveted. He leans forward, on the edge of his seat...

                                     SIMON
                         What happened?

                                     HENRY
                              (winking)
                         Well, here I am, still, after all.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE. UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT

               Later that night.

               Simon climbs the stairs and stops when he hears raunchy sex 
               from his sister's room. He stands outside her door and 
               listens.

                                     MARY
                              (off)
                         Did you throw up all over some girl?

               Simon looks up the hall and sees his mother in her room, 
               sitting on the edge of her bed, smoking. He approaches and 
               stands in her doorway.

                                     MARY
                         They were throwing bottles at the 
                         house.

               Simon says nothing. He looks down at his feet.

                                     MARY
                              (gesturing to Fay's 
                              room)
                         She's got some ex-con in there she 
                         met at the bar. Tattoos all over 
                         himself and a big red bloated nose.

                                     SIMON
                         Did you take your pills?

               Now she says nothing. She smokes and looks away.

               Simon steps into the bathroom and gets her medication. He 
               runs a glass of water and brings it in to her.

               She swallows the pills and washes them back with water.

                                     SIMON
                         You want me to tell her to be quiet?

               She looks away, unconcerned and cynical.

                                     MARY
                         What's the use? She might as well 
                         get it while she can. She's not always 
                         gunna have the ass she has now, you 
                         know. That's just how life is.

               She throws the blanket over herself and turns off the light. 
               Simon stands there in the dark.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

               Moments later.

               Simon comes downstairs into the quiet, dark kitchen and sits 
               at the table. He listens to the traffic on the highway and 
               stares off into space. Finally, he takes the notebook Henry 
               gave him from his pocket and places it before him. But then 
               he just gazes off into the dim living-room and scratches his 
               head. Returning his attention to the notebook, he digs down 
               into his pocket and retrieves his short stub of pencil.

               He opens the notebook and carefully flattens back the cover. 
               Lifting the pencil, he pauses and stares at the blank page. 
               Then, after more intense hesitation, he brings the pencil's 
               dull tip to the very top left edge of the page and begins 
               writing in a slow, laborious hand.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               The next morning.

               Henry barges in the kitchen door with two containers of coffee 
               and some jelly donuts. Simon jumps up from where he sits 
               asleep over his notebook at the table.

                                     HENRY
                         Good morning, Simon! Glorious day, 
                         huh? Here, have a donut. Can you 
                         lend me twenty dollars?

               Simon rubs the sleep from his eyes, blinks, disoriented and 
               reaches for his wallet.

                                     HENRY
                         Thanks. Where's the library in the 
                         scruffy little burgh?

                                     SIMON
                              (handing him cash)
                         Down the highway about a mile and a 
                         half and then make a left.

                                     HENRY
                         Excellent! I'm polishing up the final 
                         chapters of my 'Confession' and I 
                         need a reasonably well-stocked 
                         reference section.

               He lifts up Simon's notebook.

                                     HENRY
                         What's this?

               Simon hesitates, shyly.

                                     SIMON
                         I thought. Um. I was. I wanted to. 
                         Maybe.

               He gives up, sighs and gazes at the floor. Henry flips through 
               the book, impressed. It is full from cover to cover, every 
               page dense with Simon's cryptic scrawl. Henry frowns, 
               intrigued. Then...

                                     HENRY
                         Can I take this?

               Simon looks up, terrified. But his friend puts him at ease.

                                     HENRY
                         I'll correct the spelling.

               EXT. JUNK YARD -- DAY

               Later that day.

               Simon finds a number of volumes of the classics while crushing 
               garbage.

               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               That evening.

               Simon sits with his evening beer and his new collection of 
               soiled classics. He cracks open a volume of Shakespeare and 
               tries to read. It's an obvious struggle. He puts it aside 
               and lifts up Wordsworth, studying its cover and the texture 
               of the pages. A page flutters away and he climbs down to the 
               edge of a greasy puddle to retrieve it. It's now wet and 
               torn, so he flattens it out on the concrete and tries to fit 
               it back into the book.

               He reads a little, furrowing his brow, then drinks. He bites 
               his lip and tries again.

               He sits back, exhausted and thinks. He hears a twig snap and 
               looks back over his shoulder to see...

               Amy throws a bottle at his head.

               Smash!!!! He falls to the ground, blood streaming down his 
               neck.

               Warren runs over and grabs him by the shirt, lifting him out 
               of the puddle and smacking him in the head.

               Amy runs forward and waits with a rolled-up newspaper which 
               she sets aflame with her lighter.

               Warren punches Simon in the stomach and throws him to the 
               ground, then unzips his fly and pisses on him.

               Amy watches, giggling excitedly, waving the flaming torch.

               Simon crawls away and grabs hold of an old section of fence, 
               while Warren zips up and grabs the fire from Amy.

               Simon pulls himself to his knees, rests his face against the 
               rusted fence and gasps for breath. Warren waves the flaming 
               torch in his face.

                                     SIMON
                              (weakly, unheard)
                         One of you is gunna lose an eye.

               Amy comes nearer with a can of gasoline. Simon pulls himself 
               to his feet as she splashes him with fuel. Warren is waving 
               the torch deliriously above his head.

                                     SIMON
                              (screaming)
                         One of you is gunna lose an eye!

               Warren stops.

               Amy steps back and lowers the gas can.

               Simon turns with effort to face them, adjusts his glasses 
               and continues...

                                     SIMON
                         One of you. I promise.

               Warren watches him blankly, then is burned by the torch which 
               is too hot to handle. He drops it.

               Amy giggles, then stops, excited, but confused.

               Simon grips the rusted chainlink so that it cuts into his 
               hands and stares straight at Warren.

                                     SIMON
                         You can set me on fire. But one of 
                         you is gunna have an eye torn out of 
                         your head. I promise.

               Warren is transfixed. He shivers and looks at Amy, who steps 
               back, scared, and puts down the gas can. She turns and walks 
               away.

               Warren looks back at Simon, troubled.

               He hangs there still, glaring at him.

               Further away, Warren rejoins Amy and stares at his hands. 
               Amy looks ill.

                                     WARREN
                         Fuck.

                                     AMY
                         Take me home.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Henry is at one of the tables, correcting the spelling in 
               Simon's notebook, when he looks up and sees...

               Simon stumble in, beaten and bruised, dropping his classics 
               to the floor. Henry and Mr Deng rush over to him.

                                     HENRY
                              (scared)
                         Simon! Who did this to you?

                                     SIMON
                         I was gunna tear out their eyes. I 
                         knew I could do it.

                                     HENRY
                         Whose eyes?

                                     SIMON
                         I told them. Like you said. I told 
                         them. And I knew I could do it.

               He passes out. Henry looks at Mr Deng.

                                     MR DENG
                         You should take him home. He smells 
                         like a toilet.

               Henry nods, agreeing, then lifts Simon off the floor. Mr 
               Deng holds the door open as Henry carries his friend out 
               into the parking lot.

               Meanwhile, Gnoc gathers up the classics from the floor and 
               places them beside Simon's notebook, where it still sits 
               open on the table. She looks at it, then reads. She lifts it 
               off the table and reads further, immediately and deeply 
               engrossed.

               Mr Deng watches as Henry departs with Simon, then comes back 
               into the store and stops, startled, when he sees...

               Gnoc sitting there, staring off into space, the notebook 
               open in her hands before her, singing quietly.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Twenty minutes later.

               Fay is in the bathroom helping Simon out of his clothes, 
               trying to clean his wounds.

                                     FAY
                              (calling)
                         Shit, Mom, we gotta get him to a 
                         hospital!

                                     SIMON
                         No!

                                     FAY
                         Oh, shut up! Turn around.

               Henry is at the kitchen table with Mary. She watches him 
               suspiciously. He lets her.

                                     MARY
                         This kinda thing has happened before.

                                     HENRY
                              (standing)
                         It won't happen again.

               She watches him as he walks around the room, browsing.

                                     MARY
                         How do you know?

               He stops and lifts a small framed photo of a soldier off the 
               piano.

                                     HENRY
                         This your husband?

               Violated somehow, she gets up and snatches it out of his 
               hands. She puts it in a drawer and cringes as Henry plays 
               one note on the piano.

                                     MARY
                         Stop that.

               He fixes her with a steady, knowing stare which causes her 
               to gather the collar of her bathrobe up around her neck. She 
               steps back, exposed, when there's a knock at the door. They 
               look over to see...

               Mr Deng enter with the notebook.

                                     MR DENG
                              (nods to Mary, then)
                         Mr Fool, what is this?

                                     HENRY
                         It's poetry.

                                     MR DENG
                         Are you sure?

               Henry comes over, takes the notebook from him and shoves it 
               in his pocket.

                                     HENRY
                         Of course I'm sure. I corrected the 
                         spelling myself.

                                     MR DENG
                         It made my daughter sing.

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah, well, you know -- that's what 
                         poetry does.

                                     MR DENG
                         But she has never spoken in her life.

               Meanwhile, back in the bathroom...

                                     SIMON
                         Owww!!!

                                     FAY
                         Keep still!

                                     SIMON
                         Let me do it!

                                     FAY
                              (fed up)
                         Fine! You do it, Simon! I don't care!

               She storms out to the top of the stairs, cocks her hip and 
               whines...

                                     FAY
                         Mom! Simon's got a broken rib, his 
                         shoulder's dislocated or something, 
                         and he won't let me disinfect the 
                         gash in his head!

                                     MARY
                         Fay, just take him to the hospital, 
                         will ya!

                                     FAY
                              (stamping her foot)
                         But he won't go!

                                     MARY
                              (screaming)
                         Simon Grim, you go to the hospital 
                         with Fay right now, do hear me!

               Simon reaches out and slams the bathroom door.

               Fay looks from the bathroom door down the stairs to Mary. 
               Mary, her nerves rattled, glances over at Mr Deng, who turns 
               and leaves the house.

               Henry lights a fresh cigarette, loosens his tie and heads 
               upstairs.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM -- DAY

               A moment later.

               Henry throws open the door and enters. He steps over Simon, 
               who is on the floor, folded up against the toilet.

                                     HENRY
                         We gotta talk.

               Henry sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes the notebook 
               from his pocket.

                                     HENRY
                         What the hell were you trying to do 
                         when you wrote this thing?

               Simon just looks at him, not certain what he means.

                                     SIMON
                         Nothing.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, you know you wrote it in a 
                         kind of iambic pentameter.

                                     SIMON
                         Iambic what?

                                     HENRY
                         Verse.

               He scratches his chin and smokes.

                                     HENRY
                         Look, in my opinion, this is pretty 
                         powerful stuff. Though your spelling 
                         is Neanderthal, and your reasoning a 
                         little naive, your instincts are 
                         profound. But the whole thing needs 
                         to be given a more cohesive shape. 
                         It can be expanded. Followed through. 
                         Unified.
                              (smokes, then)
                         You see what I'm getting at?

               Simon just stares at him, overwhelmed. Henry drops the 
               notebook on the floor and points at it with his cigarette.

                                     HENRY
                         Are you willing to commit yourself 
                         to this? To really work on it? To 
                         give it its due? In the face of 
                         adversity and discouragement? To 
                         rise to the challenge you yourself 
                         have set?

               Simon just blinks, looks away and wonders.

                                     HENRY
                         And don't gimme that wonderstruck 
                         'I'm-only-a-humble-garbage-man' 
                         bullshit, either.

                                     SIMON
                         It hurts to breathe.

                                     HENRY
                              (nodding)
                         Of course it does.

               Simon coughs and Henry leans back and smokes.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE UPSTAIRS -- NIGHT

               An hour later.

               Fay cringes outside Simon's room as Henry goes about setting 
               her brother's arm.

                                     SIMON
                         Like this?

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah. No. OK?

                                     SIMON
                         Wait!

                                     HENRY
                         Don't move! Fuck. There.

                                     SIMON
                         Are you sure that's right?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes. Now shut up and lie back.

               Simon does.

                                     SIMON
                         Is this gunna hurt?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes.

               He pauses, then leans back.

                                     HENRY
                         You gunna be alright?

               Simon nods and stares at the ceiling. Henry hands him a towel.

                                     HENRY
                         Here. Bite on this.

                                     SIMON
                              (spots blood on it)
                         What's that?

                                     HENRY
                              (looking)
                         It's blood. From your head. Lie back. 
                         Shove that in your mouth and hold on 
                         to something.

               Simon bites down on the towel and grips the edge of the bed 
               with his free hand. Henry sits on his legs and gently raises 
               the broken arm.

               Outside the door, Fay bites her knuckles. Further down the 
               hall, Mary listens from her bedroom.

                                     HENRY
                         Okay. You ready?

               Simon nods. Henry grabs hold of the arm, swallows and braces 
               himself. Simon waits, then Henry tugs the arm straight.

                                     SIMON
                         Aaagghhh!!!!!!!

               Fay turns and runs down the stairs. Mary backs away into her 
               room and shuts the door.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

               Later that night.

               Henry comes downstairs and stops, tired. Fay is sitting at 
               the table with a bottle of gin and two glasses. She has dolled 
               herself up a little and Henry likes what he sees. He looks 
               her over and she smiles. He sits. She pours. They drink.

                                     FAY
                         So, do you have, like, you know, a 
                         girlfriend, Henry?

                                     HENRY
                         No.

               They drink again in silence. He lights her cigarette and 
               they watch each other closely. Finally, Fay leans on the 
               table and twirls a strand of her hair between her fingers.

                                     FAY
                         Do you find me attractive?

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, I do.

                                     FAY
                         I look young for my age, don't I?

                                     HENRY
                         How old are you?

                                     FAY
                         How old do you think I am?

                                     HENRY
                         You look young.

                                     FAY
                              (playfully)
                         How young?

                                     HENRY
                         I don't know. Young.

                                     FAY
                         But how... I mean, do I look more 
                         like twenty, or... you know, thirty?

               He drinks and studies her. She presents her profile. Finally, 
               he leans back.

                                     HENRY
                         Thirty.

               Fay jumps up, furious.

                                     FAY
                         Listen, you geek, after a couple of 
                         drinks plenty of people mistake me 
                         for eighteen!

               She grabs her bag and storms out of the house. Henry watches 
               her go, then chuckles deviously and splashes himself another 
               drink.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Next morning.

               A thirty-year-old cocktail waitress named Vicky walks up and 
               stops when she sees...

               Warren, sitting back against the side of World of Donuts, 
               smoking a joint and thinking about his future.

               She sighs and approaches.

                                     VICKY
                         Hey, Warren, are you a registered 
                         voter?

                                     WARREN
                         Bug off, Vicky!

               Unruffled, she hands him a flyer.

                                     WARREN
                              (reading)
                         'Saving America From Itself.' What 
                         the fuck is this?

                                     VICKY
                         It's everything you need to know 
                         about the upcoming elections and 
                         congressman Owen Feer and all the 
                         really good things he wants to do 
                         for our country.

               He tokes deeply, then...

                                     WARREN
                         Oh yeah, like what?

                                     VICKY
                         He wants to win back this country 
                         for us Americans, Warren, and restore 
                         some kind of cultural-moral standard 
                         to our way of life.

               Warren looks over the flyer, then reconsiders Vicky.

                                     WARREN
                         What time's your kid go off to school?

                                     VICKY
                              (carefully)
                         Nine o'clock.

                                     WARREN
                         How about I come over and visit you 
                         later?

               Vicky sighs, troubled. She adjusts her waitress uniform and 
               looks mildly offended.

                                     VICKY
                         Well, I don't know, Warren. I mean...

               Warren gets up, too.

                                     WARREN
                         Come on. I mean it. I'm trying to 
                         change.

               Vicky is hard-pressed. She wants to believe him, but knows 
               better. She thinks about it while...

               Henry passes by and approaches the store.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry enters and takes Simon's notebook from his pocket. He 
               flips through a few pages and selects one in particular.

               He tears it out of the book and tapes it up beside the 
               register so customers can read it. He winks at Gnoc. She 
               smiles shyly and makes him a coffee. He takes it and moves 
               off to a table just as...

               Vicky enters. She starts accumulating groceries, placing 
               them on the counter one item at a time.

               Henry settles down and watches as...

               Vicky returns to the counter with a bottle of orange juice 
               and notices the poem. She reads, holding the orange juice 
               out to her side.

               Gnoc starts to ring up the other purchases as her father 
               comes up behind her, busying himself with an inventory of 
               the cigarettes.

               Vicky's lip starts to tremble as she reads, a horrified 
               expression clouding her face. Finally...

               Smash!!!! She drops the bottle of orange juice and stands 
               back. Mr Deng and Gnoc jump back, alarmed.

               Henry tilts his head and pays close attention.

                                     VICKY
                              (screaming at Mr Deng)
                         How dare you put something like this 
                         up where anyone can see it!

               Mr Deng looks from her to the poem and then over at Henry. 
               Henry urges the man to stand up for himself.

                                     MR DENG
                              (to Vicky)
                         It's poetry.

                                     VICKY
                         It's pornography! The product of a 
                         diseased mind! You oughta be ashamed 
                         of yourself, Mr Deng!

                                     MR DENG
                         It made Gnoc sing.

                                     VICKY
                              (pauses, confused)
                         It's disgusting! There oughta be a 
                         law or something!

               She grabs her things and leaves. Mr Deng holds his head and 
               looks over at Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (winking)
                         There's no accounting for taste, is 
                         there, Mr Deng?

               Mr Deng has no idea. He sits, worried, as Gnoc comes out 
               from behind the counter and begins mopping up the mess.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN - DAY

               Later.

               Henry is at the kitchen table with Simon, working on the 
               poem. Simon is bandaged up, his arm in a sling, black eyes, 
               etc.

                                     HENRY
                         See, Simon, there are three kinds of 
                         there. There's 'There'. T-H-E-R-E. 
                         There are the donuts. Then there's T-
                         H-E-I-R; which is the possessive. It 
                         is their donut. Then, finally, there's 
                         'they're'. T-H-E-Y-'-R-E. A 
                         contraction, meaning they are. They're 
                         the donut people. Get it?

                                     SIMON
                         Uh-huh.

               Henry lifts up one of Simon's newly acquired classics...

                                     HENRY
                         And look, if you're gunna read 
                         Wordsworth you've gotta get a more 
                         up-to-date edition. This odoriferous 
                         tome you're so attached to doesn't 
                         even have all fourteen books of the 
                         Prelude. And you need notes. 
                         Commentary. I'll go to the library 
                         and find you the best edition they 
                         have.

                                     SIMON
                         Thank you, but that's OK. I'll stop 
                         there on my way back from work. Well, 
                         yes, maybe not today, but, you know, 
                         tomorrow, probably.

                                     HENRY
                         Quit.

                                     SIMON
                         My job?

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah.

                                     SIMON
                         Why?

                                     HENRY
                         You need time to write, Simon. To 
                         study. To reflect.

                                     SIMON
                         But I like my job.

                                     HENRY
                         We all have to make sacrifices. A 
                         vocation like ours, Simon, is not a 
                         nine to five thing. You can't put a 
                         fence around a man's soul. We think 
                         and feel where and when we can think 
                         and feel. We are the servants of our 
                         muse and we toil where she commands.

               Simon looks past him and Henry follows his gaze to find...

               Mary standing at the foot of the stairs, listening to them. 
               She says nothing. She looks Henry up and down, then shakes 
               her head disdainfully and grunts. She throws herself on the 
               couch and turns on the TV, casting acid glances over at the 
               kitchen.

               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE - DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry and Simon come outside...

                                     SIMON
                         She's clinically depressed.

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah, and what's that mean?

                                     SIMON
                              (thinking, then)
                         I guess it means it's not her fault.

               Henry wanders out to the road, checking his wallet, then...

                                     HENRY
                              (sighing)
                         You ever think of leaving?

                                     SIMON
                         Here?

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah.

                                     SIMON
                         To go where?

                                     HENRY
                         Out there. You know, into the world. 
                         Where ever.

               Simon looks off, thinks it over and slowly nods.

                                     SIMON
                         Yeah, I guess.

                                     HENRY
                              (reciting)
                         'Opportunity will step away and make 
                         room for a man to pass it by.'

                                     SIMON
                         Is that from your book?

                                     HENRY
                         No. I found it in a fortune cookie.

               He pulls the tiny piece of crumpled advice out from one of 
               his pockets and shows it to Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         Can I read your confession?

                                     HENRY
                         No. Not yet. Soon. We'll see.

                                     SIMON
                         Is it almost finished?

                                     HENRY
                              (puffing himself up)
                         Well, you know, Simon, a piece of 
                         work like this, it's... A vocation 
                         like ours... You can't put a fence 
                         around a man's soul. What I'm trying 
                         to achieve, it's... Well, it takes a 
                         lifetime really. It's a life's work.
                              (looking around)
                         But soon. Don't worry. I'd appreciate 
                         your feedback. I gotta go. See ya.

               He hurries away around the corner. Simon walks back to the 
               house and stops when he sees...

               A plain-clothes policeman, Officer Buñuel, drive up and park 
               before the house.

               Simon spies as the man gets out of his car and knocks on 
               Henry's door. He, of course, gets no answer.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Later that day.

               Simon works on his poem at the kitchen table while Fay flips 
               through a magazine and watches TV. Mary, lying on the couch 
               in her bathrobe, watches her own TV.

               The cacophony is augmented by the rattling dishwasher and 
               the trucks rumbling by on the highway outside.

               Mary looks over at her son, suspicious, and leans off the 
               couch.

                                     MARY
                         What are you doing there, Simon?

               He carefully finishes writing a word, then looks up and 
               pauses.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm writing a poem.

               Mary looks at Fay, who looks up from her magazine and 
               considers her brother. Then they break out laughing.

               Simon looks on.

               They laugh and laugh and laugh...

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Later.

               Simon is bent over his notebook, consulting a dictionary, 
               hard at work.

               Amy and three kids are grouped around the register, reading 
               the page Henry taped up earlier. As they read, Amy glances 
               anxiously back at Simon.

               They finish reading and stand back.

                                     PAT
                         So what? It ain't so great.

                                     CHRIS
                              (to Amy, of Simon)
                         That him?

               Amy nods 'Yes', then leads them towards Simon.

               Simon scribbles away.

                                     AMY
                              (off)
                         Pardon me, Simon.

               He looks up, sees her, panics and slides away on the seat. 
               Amy looks down and bites her lip, contrite. She sighs.

                                     AMY
                         Uhm. Look, ah... I'm the editor of 
                         the high school newspaper now and...

                                     PAT
                         One of the editors.

                                     AMY
                         One of the editors, and we...

                                     PAT
                         You.

                                     AMY
                         I... wanted to know if we could print 
                         your poem in this month's issue.

               Simon looks around at them all, threatened.

                                     SIMON
                         Why?

                                     AMY
                         Because I think it's great.

                                     PAT
                         I don't.

                                     CHRIS
                              (to Pat)
                         Who cares what you think?

                                     TED
                         You're a drag.

                                     CHRIS
                         A well-known drag.

                                     AMY
                              (to Simon)
                         Please?

               Simon fumbles with his pencil, ill at ease and self-conscious. 
               Then, to get rid of them, he nods his consent.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               That evening.

               Fay comes downstairs in only a towel and wet hair. She 
               switches on the TV and looks for cigarettes. She finds Mary's 
               pills on the table and remembers to ask...

                                     FAY
                         Ma, you take your medication?

               Mary is lying on the couch. She drags her eyes from the TV 
               and glances lazily at Fay, then back to the TV.

                                     FAY
                              (to herself)
                         Guess so.

               She sits at the kitchen table and lifts her magazine.

               Henry shows up at the kitchen door with a pile of library 
               books. His eyes brighten when he sees...

               Fay sitting there wearing only her towel. He knocks. She 
               looks back over her shoulder and sees him.

                                     HENRY
                         Evening, Fay.

                                     FAY
                              (disdainfully)
                         What do you want?

                                     HENRY
                         I've got these books for Simon.

               She turns away.

                                     FAY
                         Well, leave 'em there on the counter, 
                         then.

               He comes in and stacks the books near the sink. Fay pretends 
               to ignore him, but rakes her fingers through her wet hair 
               anyway, to show more shoulder.

               This is not lost on Henry, who tarries and leans back against 
               the counter, salivating.

               Fay flips through her magazine and Henry steps closer and 
               leans against the fridge.

               She casts a bored glance in his direction, then returns her 
               attention to the TV. She senses him step aside and follows 
               his movements without turning. Suddenly his hand appears 
               from behind her and gently strokes her hair. She freezes, 
               waits, wonders...

               He leans his face down beside her. She looks at him. He looks 
               at her, then down to...

               Her bare legs crossed before her on the kitchen chair. His 
               hand moves down and slides itself deep in between her things.

               Her mouth drops open.

               He looks back up at her. He grins.

               Fay jumps up and away, breathlessly clutching the towel around 
               herself.

               Henry casts a glance over her body, throws his hair back out 
               of his face and shivers with lust.

               Fay steps back and grabs hold of the staircase banister, 
               making an unconvincing gesture of injured pride.

               Henry comes closer and she steps backwards up the stairs.

               He stops, loosens his tie, holding her with his gaze.

               She readjusts her towel, throws back her wet hair, sighs 
               defiantly, then sashays into her room, leaving the door ajar.

               Henry waits there at the foot of the stairs, reaches down, 
               grabs his crotch and repositions his hard-on. He takes a 
               step up the stairs, then stops. He looks over to the couch 
               and sees...

               Mary, lying there, sedately amazed.

               He pauses, then grins.

               Mary blinks and smiles sleepily.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon sits back from his writing and rubs his neck. Putting 
               down his pencil, he looks up and sees...

               Warren enter the store and grab a beer from the cooler. Seeing 
               Simon, he waves and approaches.

                                     WARREN
                         Hey, Simon, you a registered voter?

               Simon hesitates, but then nods uncertainly. Warren hands him 
               a flyer. This year when you go to the polls, I want you to 
               consider Congressman Owen Feer. He wants to restore America 
               to its position of unmatched wealth, power and opportunity; 
               to revitalize American civilization and lead the human race 
               to even greater levels of freedom, prosperity and security! 
               He's a good man.

               He steps over to the register and pays for his beer. Mr Deng 
               glares at him, distrustfully. Warren stops on his way out 
               and snarls at the old man...

                                     WARREN
                         Immigrant.

               He leaves. Simon looks down and studies the flyer.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE. UPSTAIRS -- DAY

               Same time.

               Fay lies across her bed in her towel, holding a pose and 
               glancing anxiously back at the door. Finally, losing her 
               patience, she gets up.

                                     FAY
                         Where is he?

               She opens the door and looks out into the hall.

               He's not there.

               She steps out into the hall and listens.

                                     FAY
                         Henry?

               Nothing. She comes to the top of the stairs and hears faint 
               activity from down below. She proceeds downstairs.

               She sees no one in the kitchen, then looks in the living-
               room and stops. She goes white, her mouth falling open in 
               horror.

               Henry and Mary are screwing one another on the couch. Sloppy, 
               impassioned, brute sex.

                                     FAY
                              (screaming)
                         Mommy!!!!!

               They fall away from each other in terror and fatigue. Mary 
               clutches wildly at her bathrobe as Henry falls over the coffee 
               table, stumbles to his feet and pulls up his trousers.

               Fay is crushed. She breaks out in tears and runs upstairs.

               Henry catches his breath and starts after her, but stops, 
               uncertain and confused.

                                     MARY
                         You bastard!

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     MARY
                         Get out!

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Simon is asleep with his head down on the table. He wakes 
               finally and sees...

               Henry sitting across from him, gripping a beer and reading 
               the poem. He finishes, shuts the book and drinks.

                                     HENRY
                         Listen. I know a man. He's a big 
                         shot in the publishing business. 
                         Angus James. Smart, adventurous and 
                         tons of integrity. When this thing 
                         is ready, I'll recommend he reads 
                         it. He'll respect my opinion.

               Simon takes this in, then looks down at his hands and proceeds 
               carefully.

                                     SIMON
                         A man was here today looking for 
                         you.

                                     HENRY
                              (alert)
                         What man?

                                     SIMON
                         I don't know. He drove by the house 
                         a few times.

               Henry throws his eyes heavenward and pulls his hair. Jumping 
               to his feet, he paces maniacally.

                                     HENRY
                         Why do they torment me like this? 
                         Why? They're like a bunch of fucking 
                         mosquitoes!

               A customer a few tables away gets nervous and leaves.

                                     SIMON
                         What do they want from you?

                                     HENRY
                         They want to suffocate me, Simon! 
                         They wanna extinguish me like a flame!

               Some kid named Tim, sitting at another table, turns around 
               and asks...

                                     TIM
                         But why?

                                     HENRY
                         They're afraid, that's why! They're 
                         afraid of what I might do! What I 
                         might say! Think! They're afraid of 
                         my ideas!

               He drinks, then returns and sits beside Simon.

                                     HENRY
                         You and I are alike in this way, 
                         Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         Yeah?

                                     HENRY
                         We're outsiders. We think and feel 
                         too much and too deeply. And the 
                         world can't handle that. Our mere 
                         existence is a threat to its illusion 
                         of security. Sure, they'll name a 
                         wing of a new library after us when 
                         we're dead! But now... Now, when 
                         we're alive... Now, they wanna burn 
                         us at the stake!

               He drinks, burps, then slams down the can. He glances over 
               at Tim who is still looking on.

                                     HENRY
                         Scram.

               Tim hesitates, but then obeys. He gets up and leaves. Henry 
               returns to Simon.

                                     HENRY
                         For example, I made love to your 
                         mother about half an hour ago and 
                         now I'm beginning to think that maybe 
                         it wasn't such a good idea.

               Simon blinks. Henry adds...

                                     HENRY
                         I mean to say, I think Fay may be 
                         jealous.

               Simon is deeply confused. He looks ill. He stands and takes 
               a few steps away, staring at the floor.

                                     SIMON
                         I don't want to think about this.

                                     HENRY
                         Bad move, Simon.

               Simon stops and looks at him.

                                     HENRY
                              (pointing at him)
                         A poet has got to be able to think 
                         about anything.

               Simon pauses, then comes closer to Henry and stops.

                                     SIMON
                         Am I really a poet?

               Henry jumps up, strides around the store and speaks at the 
               top of his voice.

                                     HENRY
                         Of course you are! A great poet! But 
                         you need experience. You need to do 
                         something to be ashamed of every 
                         once in a while, for cryin' out loud.

               He walks to the door.

                                     HENRY
                         Come on! Let's go out! There's a den 
                         of iniquity right across the street! 
                         You got any money?

               He strides out of the store.

               Simon stands there, stunned and looks at Mr Deng as the old 
               man wipes off the table with a wet rag.

               INT. THE INFERNO -- NIGHT

               Later that night.

               Henry is dancing wildly on the bar with two sloppy-drunk 
               topless dancers. The place is rocking and the crowd cheers 
               them on.

               Simon sits perched on a stool, gripping the bar with white 
               knuckles and clutching a beer, looking on in terror as...

               Henry starts stripping.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Later that night.

               Simon stumbles in and heads upstairs. But he stops, seeing...

               Mary, sitting on the top step, smoking. She looks guilty and 
               tense. So does Simon.

                                     MARY
                         That man's a bad influence.

                                     SIMON
                         On who?

               She gets up and storms into her room.

               INT. FAY'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Moments later.

               Simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when 
               he sees...

               Fay, passed out drunk on her bed. Her clothes are half off 
               and her lipstick smeared. She still grips a bottle of tequila 
               in her hand.

               Simon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes. He 
               gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed.

               Her bare limbs have their effect on Simon and he finds himself 
               staring at her thigh.

               He reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked-
               up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind. He catches himself, 
               snaps his hand away and covers Fay with a blanket.

               He flees.

               INT. SIMON'S ROOM -- NIGHT

               Moments later.

               Simon is alone in the room with his bed.

               The pale sheets beckon.

               He is flushed. He blinks.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- NIGHT

               Moments later.

               He creeps down the stairs with an arm-load of books. Sitting 
               at the table, he wrenches a nearby lamp into a more useful 
               position and begins to read.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               The next morning.

               Henry stumbles up the stoop carrying a laptop computer, its 
               various accessories and a couple of coffees.

               He lets himself in and dumps the computer on the kitchen 
               counter.

               Simon is asleep on the couch, still in his clothes.

                                     HENRY
                              (shoving him)
                         Simon. Hey, Simon.
                              (Simon wakes)
                         Come on. I got ya some coffee.

               Henry trudges back to the kitchen, where he whips out his 
               red pen and immediately begins to correct Simon's poem.

               Simon rolls off the couch and makes his way to the table. 
               Seeing the computer...

                                     SIMON
                         What's this?

                                     HENRY
                         It's a computer. You write on it.

               He reaches into his pocket.

                                     HENRY
                         Here's the manual.

               Simon looks over the computer and flips through the manual.

                                     SIMON
                         Where'd you get it?

                                     HENRY
                         I stole it. Now listen. Remember how 
                         yesterday we discussed the relative 
                         desirability of cadence in relation 
                         to the readability of...

                                     FAY
                              (off)
                         Oh, shit! Not you again!

               Fay is on the stairs, hungover and disgusted. Henry throws 
               up his hands and gets up to go.

                                     HENRY
                         Simon, I can't work under these 
                         conditions.

                                     FAY
                         Yeah! Get outta here, you freak!

                                     HENRY
                         Get a life!

                                     FAY
                         Eat shit and die, Henry!

               Mary throws open her bedroom door.

                                     MARY
                              (screaming)
                         Beast! Fiend! Rapist!

                                     FAY
                         Oh, shut up, Mom!

               Fay stomps back upstairs. Mary slams her door shut. Simon 
               runs out after Henry.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Simon follows Henry out into the street and over towards 
               World Of Donuts...

                                     SIMON
                         Henry, wait up!

                                     HENRY
                         I am not a rapist!

               But Henry stops short, seeing...

               Officer Buñuel enter World of Donuts.

                                     HENRY
                         Shit. Come on, this way.

               And he runs down the street in the opposite direction. Simon 
               hangs back, but then follows...

               INT. CHURCH -- DAY

               Moments later.

               They scramble in and Henry is out of breath. He slumps down 
               into a pew.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep a look out. Tell me when he's 
                         gone.

               Simon does, but then...

                                     SIMON
                         Henry, what's going on? Who is that 
                         guy? What's he want?

                                     HENRY
                         He wants to help me! He wants to be 
                         my friend.

               He pats his pockets, looking for his smokes. Simon looks on, 
               baffled. He comes closer.

                                     SIMON
                         Help you with what?

                                     HENRY
                              (suddenly)
                         Shhh!

               He hears something, stands and moves further into the church. 
               Simon hesitates, but then follows. They hear someone crying. 
               Finally, in a pew off to one side in the shadows, they find...

               A young priest named Father Hawkes. He's a wreck. He looks 
               up from his quiet sobbing and sees...

               Henry and Simon standing there looking on with embarrassed 
               distaste. He lowers his head in shame. Henry moves closer 
               and sits beside the distraught priest.

                                     HENRY
                         What's wrong?

               The priest sighs hopelessly.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         I doubt.

               Henry leans back with a sigh and reaches for his cigarettes.

                                     HENRY
                         So, you're an honest man. Why beat 
                         yourself up about it?

               He offers a cigarette to the priest and he accepts.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         I don't know if there are grounds 
                         for faith. Is my vocation relevant? 
                         Does it make a difference?

                                     SIMON
                         A difference in what?

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         The world. The way it is. Is this a 
                         way to help relieve suffering?

                                     HENRY
                         Your vocation makes a difference.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         How can you be so sure?

                                     HENRY
                         Because vocation is the difference. 
                         Only someone who really cares doubts. 
                         Listen, father, as I was about to 
                         tell my friend Simon here, I am, 
                         without doubt, the biggest sinner 
                         within a hundred miles of this parish. 
                         But still, I've gotta stay up late 
                         at night to outdo the unending parade 
                         of mundane little atrocities I see 
                         committed every day right out in the 
                         open spaces of this loud and sunlit 
                         culture we call home.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         You seem to me to be a sensitive and 
                         generous man.

                                     HENRY
                         I like to think so. But the fact is 
                         I appreciate depravity. Nevertheless, 
                         I insist your vocation makes a 
                         difference, because to hold out 
                         anything other than a spiritual 
                         yardstick to reality is to be jerking 
                         off grandly into the abyss. Listen, 
                         have you got any money? Let's go 
                         have a drink.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Warren is stopping people on their way in and out of World 
               of Donuts.

                                     WARREN
                         Excuse me, miss, are you a registered 
                         voter?

                                     MISS
                         Oh God, really I don't know.

                                     WARREN
                         Well, I'd like to give you some 
                         information about Congressman Owen 
                         Feer. This man is gunna make a big 
                         difference in the lives of every 
                         American in the years to come...

                                     MISS
                         Thanks, sure. I gotta go, thanks.

               A man, Bill, steps up...

                                     WARREN
                         Pardon me, sir...

                                     BILL
                         Fuck off!

                                     WARREN
                         Right.

               Warren stands back and loosens his tie. He looks over at 
               Pearl age seven, who is sitting outside the store.

                                     WARREN
                         What time's your mother get off work?

               She doesn't respond. He shakes his head and approaches. He 
               sees Fay exit the store...

                                     WARREN
                         Fay, are you a registered voter?

                                     FAY
                              (stopping)
                         Don't you dare talk that way to me! 
                         And keep your hands off my brother. 
                         Pearl, what are you doing here?

                                     WARREN
                         I'm watchin' her.

               Fay figures it out and approaches.

                                     FAY
                         You and Vicky get back together?

                                     WARREN
                         I gotta regular job now and 
                         everything.

               She lifts a flyer and reads.

                                     FAY
                         I saw this retard on TV this morning.

                                     WARREN
                         He's gunna be the next president of 
                         the United States of America, Fay.

                                     FAY
                         Keep dreamin' Warren. The guy's a 
                         Nazi.

                                     WARREN
                         I like him!

                                     FAY
                         Gimme a light.

                                     WARREN
                              (lighting her cigarette)
                         He's a decent man. He takes 
                         complicated issues and totally 
                         simplifies them. And I appreciate 
                         that.

                                     FAY
                         You still sell dope?

                                     WARREN
                         No. You know what the problem is 
                         with this country, Fay? Me. I'm the 
                         problem. We live in a culture of 
                         poverty and crime, where the work 
                         ethic is undermined and male 
                         responsibility is made irrelevant.

               She studies him a moment more, lost, then shakes her head 
               and helps the child off the car.

                                     FAY
                         Come on, Pearl, let's go play at my 
                         house.

                                     WARREN
                         She gives you any trouble, Fay, you 
                         just let me know.

               INT. THE INFERNO -- DAY

               An hour later.

               Henry and Father Hawkes are drinking. Simon leans on the 
               bar, nodding off to sleep. After a while, Father Hawkes leans 
               back and...

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Do you think human beings are innately 
                         bad?

                                     HENRY
                         Worse than bad! Monstrous! But I 
                         love that about them.
                              (banging on the bar)
                         Wake up, Simon!

               Simon falls off his bar stool.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Warren straightens his tie and looks over to see...

               Simon stagger up.

               Warren shakes his head in dismay and approaches. Simon 
               steadies himself against the wall of the building.

                                     WARREN
                         Jesus Christ, Simon, you're letting 
                         yourself go to hell! You read that 
                         flyer I gave you?

                                     SIMON
                         What?

                                     WARREN
                         Simon, wake up and smell the coffee, 
                         huh! It's up to guys like you and me 
                         to help create a better tomorrow!

               Simon is lost.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               He staggers into World of Donuts and heads for the coffee 
               machine, but stops when he sees Buñuel talking to Mr Deng. 
               Buñuel looks over. Their eyes lock.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Same time.

                                     WARREN
                              (to Vicky)
                         Why would I steal a computer from 
                         the campaign office?

                                     VICKY
                         I'm not saying you did, I'm just 
                         saying one was and since you do have 
                         this criminal background...

               Whack!!! He slaps her...

                                     WARREN
                              (pointing)
                         Don't judge me!

               Simon runs out of the store and limps away towards home as 
               Buñuel storms out in pursuit. Simon tries to run, but Buñuel 
               catches him easily.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Look, I know you know him. People 
                         have seen you around together.

               Simon ceases to struggle, but shakes himself free and stands 
               looking down at his feet. Buñuel stands aside and watches 
               him a moment, then reaches in his jacket and brings out his 
               badge.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         I'm his parole officer.

               Simon studies the badge and waits a little, before asking...

                                     SIMON
                         What did he do?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         I'm not supposed to talk about that 
                         stuff with people.

                                     SIMON
                         He's my. Friend.

               Buñuel pauses, then puts away his badge and looks around the 
               parking lot.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Mr Deng says you're some sort of a 
                         poet, or something.

               Simon doesn't corroborate this. He looks away and readjusts 
               his sling. Buñuel scratches his head, satisfied and prepares 
               to leave. But first...

                                     BUÑUEL
                         You tell Henry to call me -- Officer 
                         Buñuel -- pronto! Or they're gunna 
                         chuck his ass straight back into 
                         jail! Got it?

               Simon shrugs.

               Buñuel waits a moment, then steps away and gets back in his 
               car. Simon watches as the parole officer drives away and 
               passes...

                                     WARREN
                         Vicky, look I'm sorry.

                                     VICKY
                         Don't you even come near me!

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Later.

                                     FAY
                         What do you mean, you quit?

                                     SIMON
                         I quit my job.

                                     FAY
                         Why!

                                     SIMON
                         There are things I want to do.

                                     FAY
                         Like what?

               Simon thinks of trying to explain, but then decides not to.

                                     SIMON
                         'Opportunity will step out of the 
                         way to let a man... pass it by.'

                                     FAY
                         Are you drunk?

                                     SIMON
                         Now you have to go out and get a 
                         job!

                                     FAY
                         I am not gettin' a job!
                              (paces, then)
                         Who's gunna look after Mom!

                                     SIMON
                         I will.

               Fay looks at the ceiling and sighs.

                                     FAY
                         Pearl, go outside.

               They wait as the child goes outside.

               Mary listens, unseen, from her bedroom door.

               Fay comes over and frowns at her brother. She's about to 
               lecture him, but he cuts her off.

                                     SIMON
                         If you treat Mom like a sick person, 
                         she's gunna stay like... you know, a 
                         sick person.

               Fay tries to control herself. She sighs tiredly and attempts 
               to reason with him...

                                     FAY
                         Simon, don't be retarded...

                              (banging the table)
                         I am not retarded!

               Fay steps back, startled. Simon stands, but can't decide 
               which way to go. He sits back down.

                                     SIMON
                         I can see with my own eyes.

               Mary turns away from her door and sits on her bed.

               Fay leans over the stove, where a large pot of water is 
               beginning to boil.

                                     FAY
                         Mom can't be left alone with no one 
                         to keep an eye on her.

               Simon is frustrated and lashes out.

                                     SIMON
                         Well, who's been keeping an eye on 
                         her while you've been out getting 
                         fucked by every OTB winner in town?

               Fay's mouth falls open and she staggers back, hurt.

               Simon regrets it already and stands to leave, scared. But 
               Fay grabs the pot off the stove and hurls it at him, splashing 
               boiling water all over his back.

                                     SIMON
                         Aggghhhh!!!

               Outside, Pearl turns and looks back at the house.

               Simon lies gasping on the floor of the kitchen. Fay falls 
               back against the stove, terrified and drops her head into 
               her hands.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM -- DAY

               Later.

               Fay is crouched on the floor, sobbing, while Simon lies in a 
               tub of cold water. Mary comes in with a pathetic little 
               freezer tray of ice cubes and dumps them into the tub.

               She steps back into the hall and throws the ice tray down 
               the stairs. She glares back at Fay, who cries even louder as 
               Simon stares up at the ceiling.

               Mary shakes her head and walks into her room, slamming the 
               door behind her.

                                     FAY
                              (sniffling)
                         What happened to her, Simon? How did 
                         she get this way? Will it happen to 
                         me too? Huh? Why are we so fucked 
                         up?

               Simon has no answers. But he reaches out and touches his 
               sister's hand.

               INT. LIBRARY -- DAY

               Evening.

               Simon comes limping in, all stiff because of his scalded 
               back. He's not familiar with the library, so he stands looking 
               around, trying to figure it out.

               INT. LIBRARY STACKS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               He wanders into an aisle, overwhelmed by all the books. Coming 
               to the far end of the aisle, he looks off to his left and 
               sees Henry sitting on a small stool, reading, with ten or 
               twenty open volumes scattered around him on the floor.

                                     SIMON
                              (approaching)
                         Henry?

                                     HENRY
                              (looking up and rising)
                         Simon! What are you doing here?

                                     SIMON
                         Henry... Your parole officer, Officer 
                         Buñuel, came by again today.

               Henry sighs and sits back down.

                                     SIMON
                         He told me to tell you that if you 
                         don't call him they're gunna put you 
                         back in jail.

                                     HENRY
                         Simon...

                                     SIMON
                         He gave me this number...

                                     HENRY
                         Simon...

                                     SIMON
                         He was talking to Mr Deng too, and, 
                         well, you know, I was thinking...

                                     HENRY
                         Simon, just shut the fuck up!

               Simon blinks and looks down at his feet, unable to respond. 
               Deeply hurt, he simply turns to walk away. But Henry reaches 
               out and grabs his arm. Simon stops, pauses and looks back at 
               his friend.

                                     HENRY
                         Forgive me.

               He lets go and turns away on his stool.

                                     HENRY
                         Forgive me, Simon.

               Simon comes back over to him.

                                     SIMON
                         Call him, Henry. Please.

               Henry gives in slowly to the inevitable. He sighs deeply and 
               stands, handing Simon a book...

                                     HENRY
                         OK. Look, do me a favor. You got a 
                         library card?

                                     SIMON
                         Yeah.

                                     HENRY
                         Check this out for me.

               Simon looks at the cover: Paradise Lost.

                                     HENRY
                         Milton. Seventeenth century. English. 
                         You see, Simon, it's important my 
                         'Confession' dig up the past, comb 
                         previous evidence and help chart the 
                         historic -- even the aesthetic -- 
                         inevitability of my ideas. And...

               A young woman passes by, scanning the stacks. She and Henry 
               have a split second of eye contact, then she turns and moves 
               away. Henry straightens his tie and watches her go.

                                     HENRY
                         This place is crawling with chicks, 
                         Simon. Wander around. Leer a little. 
                         Cop a feel. Impose yourself on 'em. 
                         See what happens.

                                     SIMON
                         I make girls uncomfortable.

                                     HENRY
                         Bullshit! You've got a rough hewn 
                         charm that sets 'em on edge. Now, 
                         listen, I gotta go.

                                     SIMON
                         Henry?

               Henry stops and turns. Simon pauses, then...

                                     SIMON
                         What did you do?

               Henry watches him for a moment, then swaggers closer...

                                     HENRY
                         I got caught.

               Simon waits for more but is disappointed. With one final 
               cracked grin at his friend, Henry throws back his shoulders, 
               slicks back his hair and strides off. Simon watches him go 
               and frowns, not comforted. He flips through the pages of 
               Paradise Lost.

                                     SIMON
                              (voice over)
                         'Whereto with speedy words the arch-
                         fiend replied Fallen Cherub, to be 
                         weak is miserable...'

               INT. LIBRARY READING ROOM -- DAY

               Moments later.

               He comes out from the stacks, working his way through the 
               first page of Paradise Lost. He nearly bumps into a girl and 
               they stop and look at one another. He tries to hold her gaze 
               for a moment, challenging himself, but then turns away and 
               stalks to a table. He sits and leans over the page.

               After a moment, though, he lifts his face and glances at...

               Another girl, sitting further down the table. She looks up 
               from her reading and returns his gaze.

               He smiles at her.

               She gets up and leaves.

               Simon frowns, confounded and returns to his book. He takes 
               out his notebook and pencil, meaning to take notes, but sees 
               instead...

               A third girl sitting at another table, listening to her 
               Walkman and typing her homework into a laptop computer.

               He finds himself staring at her and forces himself back to 
               his book. But he can't help himself and glances back over at 
               her.

               With a sigh, he begins to write in his notebook...

                                     SIMON
                              (voice-over)
                         Why is it this beautiful girl makes 
                         me sad? Does she know how beautiful 
                         she is? Do people tell her? Does she 
                         ever feel stupid?

               He looks back over at her. She happens to look up and their 
               eyes meet. She smiles. Horrified, he looks down.

                                     SIMON
                         Why don't I smile when she looks at 
                         me? I look away. Ashamed of myself.

               He watches her again, thinks, then writes...

                                     SIMON
                         Her figure makes me violent. I want 
                         to somehow break her. But tenderly. 
                         How is this possible? Ask Henry.

               He writes a few moments more, scribbling across the page, 
               then stops and looks back over at the girl.

                                     SIMON
                              (voice-over)
                         I can't breathe.

               He tears out the page and folds it in half. Then he gets up 
               and crosses the room to where the girl is busily engaged in 
               her work. She looks up, sees him, and removes her headset 
               with a pleasant smile. He places his note on the table before 
               her, then turns and walks quickly away.

               The girl watches him go, confused, then lifts the note and 
               reads...

                                     SIMON
                              (voice-over)
                         Why do I do this to myself? And why 
                         do I reduce you to only one 
                         possibility? These are not even 
                         questions anymore. I know the answers 
                         myself. This isn't a page of notes. 
                         It's a letter. A letter to you. A 
                         desperate act. You are a miracle to 
                         me. I can't breathe.

               By now, Simon is gone from the library. The girl finishes 
               reading the letter and looks around in astonishment.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Evening.

               Henry enters and sits with Buñuel.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         How are you, Henry?

                                     HENRY
                              (frowning)
                         Peachy. Gimme a light.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Have you found a job?

               Henry just glares at him and smokes.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         How 'bout those Alcoholics Anonymous 
                         meetings, did you go over and visit 
                         them yet?

                                     HENRY
                         What happened to this assistant 
                         librarian position you were supposed 
                         to set me up with?

               Buñuel looks down, disappointed.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         I tried, Henry. I really did.

                                     HENRY
                         So what happened?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Henry, with your background... Well, 
                         I mean, with your record, they didn't 
                         think it'd be right to have you at 
                         the neighborhood library.

                                     HENRY
                         Why not?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         They thought you'd be a bad influence 
                         on the kids.

               Henry sits back, offended.

                                     BUÑUEL
                              (adds)
                         Or worse.

                                     HENRY
                         So my word is not enough. My promise 
                         worthless. The fact I've served my 
                         time nothing but the emblem of my 
                         continuing guilt.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Apparently.

               Henry leans back and sighs, furious and indignant.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Simon comes in, excited and preoccupied, and finds Fay working 
               at the computer.

                                     FAY
                         What's up?

                                     SIMON
                              (guiltily)
                         Nothing.

                                     FAY
                         I'm creating my résumé. This 
                         computer's got a program especially 
                         for it. I bought some special 
                         stationery too. It's scented. Look.

               She shoves a sheath of papers up under his nose and he backs 
               away in disgust.

                                     FAY
                         It's roses.

               Simon takes his notebooks from a cabinet above the fridge.

                                     SIMON
                         Can you type my poem into that thing?

                                     FAY
                              (shocked)
                         That's your poem?

                                     SIMON
                         Yeah.

                                     FAY
                              (smokes, then)
                         Simon, Mom's right about you. A poem's 
                         supposed to be a small, delicate 
                         kinda thing. Kinda feminine. Gentle. 
                         Look at this. You've made a fuckin' 
                         telephone book.

               He places the notebooks on the table and leaves the house. 
               Fay clears the computer screen, pulls the notebooks closer 
               and gets down to work.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Moments later.

               Simon arrives with a six-pack and finds Henry sitting in 
               front of the fire, staring into the flames, brooding darkly.

                                     HENRY
                         I was caught. Yes, I was caught... 
                         once. I was caught in flagranti 
                         delicto screwing a thirteen-year-old 
                         girl named Susan. She was an ugly 
                         and mean-spirited kid, but she knew 
                         how to play upon my weaknesses which, 
                         I admit, are deep and many.

               He drinks, then looks at Simon and adds...

                                     HENRY
                         You appear shocked.

                                     SIMON
                              (he is)
                         Sorry.

               Henry stands and leans over the fire.

                                     HENRY
                         It was a pathetic little conspiracy. 
                         A transparently desperate attempt to 
                         discredit me and my ideas; to label 
                         me a mere pedophile. As if I'd be 
                         ashamed of such a thing. As if 
                         Socrates himself hadn't been taken 
                         out of circulation for corrupting 
                         the youth of Athens!

               He comes over and takes a beer. He strides around the room, 
               thinking, reflecting.

                                     HENRY
                         Seven years. Seven years for one 
                         afternoon of blissful transgression. 
                         But what of it? Who cares? Prison's 
                         not so bad; particularly if one's a 
                         sex offender, free from the popular 
                         and conventional horror of sodomy.

               Stops, drinks declares...

                                     HENRY
                         They were not 'lost years'.

               He approaches the notebooks lined up on the mantelpiece.

                                     HENRY
                         I put them to good use. I began my 
                         major work. My opus.

               He glances over at Simon, who sits gripping his beer, 
               watching, rapt.

                                     HENRY
                         Believe me, Simon, this incident 
                         with the girl, prison... It pales to 
                         insignificance in the wider context 
                         of my career.

               He pauses and swills back some beer. He brightens up, gets 
               excited...

                                     HENRY
                         Nothing in comparison to the day my 
                         'Confession' is unleashed.
                              (beginning to pace)
                         What an orgy we'll have then, huh? 
                         What shouts of outrage from the 
                         offended populace, from the 
                         sanctimonious purveyors of culture 
                         and quality, the righteous defenders 
                         of what ever inane and haphazard 
                         notion of progress then in vogue. 
                         They'll be beside themselves with 
                         fiercely reasoned critical analysis. 
                         Apoplectic with indignation!

               Drinks sloppily, burps, wipes his mouth with his arm.

                                     HENRY
                         Their feelings will be hurt.

               He smashes the bottle in the fireplace.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, like a mirror which reflects 
                         only the inside of the person before 
                         it, my 'Confession' will lovingly 
                         render humanity's common monstrosity 
                         in all of its lurid wide screen glory.

               He grabs a new beer and twists off its cap.

                                     HENRY
                         Why should I blush or feel shame 
                         before the common lot of humanity, 
                         anyway, for a few banal and, again I 
                         admit, inelegant transgressions?

               He drinks, sighs and sits back down.

                                     HENRY
                         After all, really, I'm doing 
                         civilization a favor.

               Simon sits back in awe. He waits a moment and thinks. Finally 
               he stands and approaches the 'Confession'. He reaches out 
               and drags his hand across the notebooks.

                                     SIMON
                         When can I read it?

               Henry sits staring into the flames again. He pauses, then...

                                     HENRY
                         Soon.

               INT. CHURCH -- DAY

               Next day.

               Simon and Father Hawkes are deep in conversation.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         We are told not to judge. But to 
                         forgive. Not to look into our 
                         neighbor's eye to find the bad, but 
                         to find the good.
                              (pacing)
                         Now this is difficult. I admit.
                              (pause)
                         But having a good friend is not always 
                         easy.

               Simon listens and carefully considers all the priest says.

                                     SIMON
                         Yes, but... do you think Henry is... 
                         dangerous?

               Father Hawkes pauses, then comes closer and sits.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         He needs help. Our help. Yours 
                         especially.

                                     SIMON
                         But what can I do?

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         The best parts of himself come to 
                         the surface when he's helping someone 
                         learn. I've seen this. Let yourself 
                         be taught. Show your appreciation 
                         for his guidance. In this way, you 
                         know, perhaps. Well. There's hope 
                         for everyone. Even. Even Henry.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Fay comes walking up through the parking lot with Simon's 
               notebooks and a pile of typed papers. She's a wreck; tear-
               stained face and a ball of tissues gripped in her hand like 
               a weapon. She throws open the door to the World of Donuts 
               and looks around.

               The place is crowded with teenagers hanging around like it 
               was a café or student union.

               Fay sniffles tragically and falls on the counter.

                                     FAY
                         Gnoc, gimme a value pack of Kleenex, 
                         will ya?

               Gnoc gets the Kleenex while Fay overhears two kids near 
               Simon's poem...

                                     TIM
                         The violence of the imagery reminds 
                         me of early Clash, while the lyricism 
                         of the verse recalls, for me, Walt 
                         Whitman.

                                     BIBI
                         I would have said Dickinson, maybe 
                         even Eliot, and so on. But I agree 
                         with the punk roots...

               Fay pays for her tissues and makes her way to the back of 
               the store where she finds Simon with Henry, who is holding 
               forth to his friend and the small coterie of high school 
               students surrounding them...

                                     HENRY
                         The greats all say the same thing: 
                         little. And what little there is to 
                         be said is immense. Or, in other 
                         words, follow your own genius to 
                         where it leads without regard for 
                         the apparent needs of the world at 
                         large, which, in fact, has no needs 
                         as such, but, rather, moments of 
                         exhaustion in which it is incapable 
                         of prejudice.
                              (drinks)
                         We can only hope to collide with 
                         these moments of unselfconsciousness. 
                         This divine fatigue... this...

                                     FAY
                              (sitting)
                         Push over.

               Henry takes the typed manuscript from her and continues...

                                     HENRY
                         As I tried to make plain in Paris: 
                         'Nous savons que nous avons chuté 
                         parce que nous savons qui nous 
                         sommes.' 'We know we have fallen 
                         because we know who we are.'

                                     FAY
                              (skeptically)
                         When were you in Paris?

                                     HENRY
                              (interrupted)
                         That's beside the point. But did 
                         they listen to me? Of course not!

               Fay blows her nose and Simon is concerned.

                                     SIMON
                         You alright, Fay?

                                     FAY
                              (lighting a cigarette)
                         No, I'm not alright! Your poem brought 
                         my period on a week and half early! 
                         So just shut up. Everybody just shut 
                         up!

               She drops her head to the table and cries. Henry and Simon 
               look on in silence. Then Henry continues...

                                     HENRY
                         For is this not the best of all 
                         possible worlds? Are not the evils 
                         of this world necessary components 
                         of a cosmos that could not exist 
                         without them?

               Amy's girlfriend, Chris, leans forward studiously and asks...

                                     CHRIS
                         So, do you believe in God?

                                     HENRY
                              (smokes, shrugs)
                         Unfortunately.

                                     FAY
                              (lifting her head)
                         Yeah, but when were you in Paris?

                                     HENRY
                              (aggravated)
                         At. One. Time.

                                     CHRIS
                         Simon, can I have your autograph?

               Simon looks from her to Henry. Henry winks at him.

                                     HENRY
                         Go ahead. But never let yourself be 
                         flattered.

               Simon signs the girl's book.

                              (to Henry)

                                     HENRY
                         Who?

                         Yeah. Angus James. How about sending 
                         this poem to him?

               Henry seems a bit put upon.

                                     HENRY
                         Because it's not done yet.

                                     SIMON
                         I don't know.

               Fay and Amy talk tech as...

                                     HENRY
                              (continues)
                         The thing to do is to send parts of 
                         it to different magazines and literary 
                         journals first. That kinda thing. 
                         You know. Substantiate it.

                                     AMY
                              (looking up)
                         What's 'scatalogical' mean?

               Henry sips his beer and looks at her.

                                     HENRY
                         Filth, child. A preoccupation with 
                         excrement. Why?

                                     AMY
                         That's what the Board of Education 
                         called Simon's poem, yesterday; 
                         scatological.

               Henry reaches across the table and shakes Simon's hand.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               The next day.

               Fay is frying something on the stove, a cigarette hangs from 
               her lip. A middle-aged woman with a press ID on her lapel 
               appears at the kitchen door and taps.

                                     EDNA
                         Hello?

                                     FAY
                         Yeah, I'm listening.

                                     EDNA
                         My name is Edna Rodriguez and I write 
                         the human interest column for the 
                         Queens County Examiner and I was 
                         just wondering if I could have a 
                         word with Simon Grim?

               Intrigued, Fay steps over to the door with her spatula. She 
               looks Edna over, studies her ID, then steps away and screams 
               upstairs.

                                     FAY
                         Simon!

                                     EDNA
                              (startled)
                         Thank you.

               Fay comes back over near the door, waving her spatula.

                                     FAY
                         You can't talk to him for, you know, 
                         too long or anything, 'cause he's 
                         gotta, you know... he writes all 
                         day. That's all he does. Can you 
                         believe that?

               No response.

                                     FAY
                              (calling again)
                         Hey! Simon! Get down here!

               Simon finally shuffles into the kitchen.

                                     FAY
                         Simon, this is Edna. She's from the 
                         newspaper.

                                     EDNA
                              (rapid fire)
                         Simon, the Parents' Association at 
                         the local high school are calling 
                         your poem pornography. The teachers 
                         are defending the students' right to 
                         exercise their critical tastes and 
                         sensibilities. The county agrees 
                         with the Church and considers the 
                         poem emblematic of modern society's 
                         moral disintegration. How do you 
                         feel about these controversial 
                         reactions to your poem?

               Simon says nothing. He just stares at her.

                                     FAY
                              (punching him)
                         Simon, answer the woman.

               Simon just looks away, thinks, then wanders back upstairs. 
               Mary passes him on his way out of the kitchen and comes up 
               to Fay and Edna at the door.

                                     MARY
                         I need my prescription filled.

                                     FAY
                         Mom, this is Edna. Edna, Mom.

                                     EDNA
                         Mrs Grim, what was Simon like as a 
                         child?

                                     MARY
                         We all thought he was retarded.

                                     FAY
                         Everyone did.

                                     MARY
                         Never said a word.

                                     FAY
                         He masturbated constantly.

                                     MARY
                         Had no friends.

                                     FAY
                         Till he met Henry.

                                     MARY
                         And that's when all the trouble really 
                         started.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Henry is shaving. Simon sits in the kitchen, sorting through 
               rejection letters...

                                     SIMON
                              (reading)
                         Dear Mr Grim, we here at the magazine 
                         consider ourselves and the publication 
                         open-minded and cutting edge and 
                         have consistently printed the work 
                         of the most brilliant and farseeing 
                         young talent of the day. Every week 
                         we are forced to return writing which 
                         we can not for one reason or another 
                         publish and include a brief but polite 
                         refusal. But this tract you've sent 
                         us demands a response as violent as 
                         the effect your words have had upon 
                         us. Drop dead. Keep your day job. 
                         Sincerely, The Editors.

                                     HENRY
                         De gustibus non disputandum est.

                                     SIMON
                              (thinking)
                         You can't argue with taste?

                                     HENRY
                         About taste. You can't argue about 
                         taste. God, Simon.

               Simon gives up and pushes the letters away, beaten.

                                     SIMON
                         The other twenty-five are almost as 
                         bad. I don't know why I bother.

               Henry drops his razor and stomps out into the hall.

                                     HENRY
                         What do you mean you don't know why 
                         you bother? You bother because you 
                         know the poem is excellent!

                                     SIMON
                         Do I?

                                     HENRY
                         Of course you do!

                                     SIMON
                         I'm not so sure sometimes.

                                     HENRY
                         Can you sit there, look me straight 
                         in the eye, and tell me you don't 
                         think this poem is great? That it is 
                         not at once a work of great lyrical 
                         beauty and ethical depth? That it is 
                         not a genuine, highly individual, 
                         and profound meditation on the miracle 
                         of existence?

               Simon holds the stare, overwhelmed.

                                     SIMON
                         I, ah...

                                     HENRY
                         Can you?

               Simon looks away, thinks a moment, then looks back at Henry.

                                     SIMON
                         No. I can't.

                                     HENRY
                         So, you see, you have no choice!

               He goes back into the bathroom. Simon thinks a while, then...

                                     SIMON
                              (calling)
                         Can you recommend it to your friend, 
                         the publisher?

               No response.

                                     SIMON
                         Henry? Can you recommend the poem to 
                         him?

               Still no response. Simon gets up and stands in the bathroom 
               doorway. Henry is shaving.

                                     SIMON
                         I mean, I think it's finished and, 
                         for better or worse, it is book 
                         length.

                                     HENRY
                         That might not be as easy as it seems.

                                     SIMON
                         Why?

                                     HENRY
                         Well, it's been a long time. My name 
                         might not carry as much weight as it 
                         once did with Angus.

                                     SIMON
                         But he's your friend, right?

                                     HENRY
                         We were close at one time.

                                     SIMON
                         You said he respected your opinion.

               Henry puts down his razor and looks at Simon in the mirror.

                                     HENRY
                         Look, Simon, opinions come and go.

               He sees Simon looks worried.

                                     HENRY
                         To be honest; my ideas, my writing, 
                         they haven't always been received 
                         well or even calmly. They're 
                         upsetting. I'm a controversial man.

               He walks around the bathroom, gesticulating.

                                     HENRY
                         You see, what I'm doing is too 
                         radical. Too uncompromising. It'll 
                         take time for people to see its value. 
                         It's ahead of its time, perhaps, or 
                         maybe just...
                              (stops)
                         A recommendation from me might do 
                         you as much harm as it does good.

               Simon patiently absorbs all this, then walks through the 
               kitchen and looks across at the 'Confession' notebooks.

                                     SIMON
                         Henry, why can't I read the 
                         'Confession'?

                                     HENRY
                         Because certain work needs to be 
                         experienced all at once in order for 
                         one to appreciate the full force of 
                         its character.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Simon talks with Fay as she eats her lunch.

                                     FAY
                         Simon, wake up! The guy's in a dream 
                         world!

                                     SIMON
                         He's afraid that his reputation will 
                         prevent people from giving my work 
                         an honest chance.

                                     FAY
                         His reputation as what?

                                     SIMON
                         As a writer.

                                     FAY
                         Gimme a break.

                                     SIMON
                         He's kinda like in exile. Marginalized 
                         on account of his ideas.

                                     FAY
                         If he's such a great big fat genius, 
                         why doesn't he write books? Like you 
                         do.

                                     SIMON
                         He has. He's written a book. It's 
                         almost completed. He's been working 
                         on it for years. It's just not 
                         published.

                                     FAY
                         Yeah, I bet. It's probably disgusting.

                                     SIMON
                              (defensively)
                         It's a quite serious and difficult 
                         piece of work, apparently.

                                     FAY
                         Have you read it?

                                     SIMON
                         No. Not yet. Soon. Certain work needs 
                         to be experienced all at once in 
                         order for one to appreciate the full 
                         force of its character.

                                     FAY
                         Yeah, well, what ever. Listen, Simon, 
                         forget Henry. Go straight up to this 
                         Angus James character yourself and 
                         make him read your poem.

               She gets up to go. She's wearing a smart outfit.

                                     FAY
                         I'm gunna apply for a job at the one-
                         hour photo joint and then go over to 
                         the Mall to see about that job in 
                         the bank. Make sure Mom takes her 
                         pills. See ya.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Mary is sitting, brooding in front of the TV, which displays 
               only static white noise. She turns it off with the remote 
               and sits in silence for a moment.

               She gets off the couch and moves to the kitchen table, where 
               Fay's computer sits. She goes over and reaches up above the 
               fridge, opening the cabinet containing Simon's notebooks.

               She hesitates, then takes them down and holds them in her 
               hands, as if to begin reading. But then she puts them back.

               She walks over to the piano and stands there, hesitating, 
               before slowly sitting down and opening it. She lifts her 
               hands to play, then pauses and looks around behind her, making 
               sure no one is there.

               But, finally, she turns back and begins playing.

               She plays a sad-sounding modern classical piece with rusty 
               accomplishment. At one time she was probably quite good.

               She plays for a while, gradually letting herself become moved 
               by the music. But then she stops, pauses, and looks behind 
               her.

               Simon is standing in the kitchen. He has been deeply affected 
               by her playing.

                                     SIMON
                         Please don't stop.

               She stares him down a moment longer, then looks away and 
               closes the piano. She returns to the couch and switches on 
               the TV.

               Simon comes closer. He sits.

                                     SIMON
                         That was nice what you were playing.

                                     MARY
                         Yes, it was nice. But it was 
                         unremarkable.

               Simon waits. Eventually...

                                     SIMON
                         Does that matter?

                                     MARY
                              (looking right at him)
                         Yes. It does.

               She gets up off the couch and goes upstairs. She slams her 
               bedroom door and leaves Simon alone on the couch. He thinks. 
               Then, he gets up and goes into the kitchen.

               He takes the typed manuscript of his poem from the cabinet 
               above the refrigerator and goes to the door. He pauses, 
               clutches the poem and goes out.

               EXT. SUBWAY STATION -- DAY

               Simon waits, clutching his poem to his side, as a train pulls 
               into the station. Excited and determined, he gets on.

               INT. TRAIN -- DAY

               Simon travels to New York City. He finds an envelope on the 
               floor to put the poem in.

               INT. MARY'S ROOM -- DAY

               Mary wakes up and sits on the edge of the bed, feeling 
               regretful about her tone of voice with Simon.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Mary comes down into the kitchen and listens.

                                     MARY
                         Simon?

               No answer. She steps over to the cabinet and almost takes 
               down Simon's notebook. But doesn't. She grabs her pills and 
               is about to take them. But then she stops. She puts them 
               down and goes to the cabinet. She takes down Simon's notebooks 
               and sits at the table, pauses, then pulls them closer and 
               begins to read.

               INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE LOBBY -- DAY

               Simon enters a big, posh lobby and checks the registry.

               INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Simon comes out of the elevator and enters the reception 
               area of James Midriff and Sutton Publishing. He walks 
               hesitantly up to the receptionist, a bright and spirited 
               young woman named Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         Hi, I'll take that.

               Simon steps back defensively.

                                     LAURA
                         Aren't you the messenger?

                                     SIMON
                         No.

                                     LAURA
                         Are you here to fix the plumbing?

                                     SIMON
                         I'm here to see Mr. Angus James.

                                     LAURA
                              (amused)
                         Are you?

                                     SIMON
                         I'm not a plumber. Or a messenger. I 
                         was once a garbage man. But now I'm 
                         a poet.

               Laura steps back, cocks her head and removes her designer 
               eye-wear.

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               Same time.

               Angus is at a big table with two other men, Steve and Barry.

                                     BARRY
                         The book, as we know it, Angus, will 
                         be a thing of the past within the 
                         next few years. Novels, articles, 
                         newspapers will all be downloaded on 
                         to our personal computers anyway.

                                     ANGUS
                         So you're telling me to get out of 
                         the publishing business?

                                     STEVE
                         No. But we've got to re-invent the 
                         publishing business for the electronic 
                         age.

               Laura knocks.

                                     ANGUS
                         Yes, Laura?

                                     LAURA
                         I'm sorry to disturb you, gentlemen, 
                         but... Angus, there's a particularly 
                         wound-up young garbage man out here 
                         who seems to have written a poem. A 
                         long poem. And I recall how, at last 
                         month's meeting, you stressed the 
                         need for us to be on the look-out 
                         for more marginalized verse from 
                         unestablished quarters of the American 
                         scene.

                                     ANGUS
                         Did I say that?

               Steve and Barry nod.

                                     STEVE
                         Yeah. You did.

                                     BARRY
                         Twice.

                                     ANGUS
                         Well, OK. Make an appointment, Laura. 
                         Sometime next month.

                                     LAURA
                         Right-e-o.

               And she's gone.

                                     ANGUS
                              (returning)
                         So, anyway, how is the digital 
                         revolution going to help me sell 
                         books?

               INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY

               Simon looks disappointed.

                                     SIMON
                         Why can't I see him now?

                                     LAURA
                              (sincerely)
                         Because he's a very important man 
                         and, well, you're not.

               Simon just looks down at his shoes. Laura touches his arm 
               and reassures him.

                                     LAURA
                         Be reasonable.

               He looks up, pauses, then...

                                     SIMON
                         Why?

               INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY

               Same time.

                                     ANGUS
                         I don't think people are going to 
                         prefer reading books on television, 
                         Steve.

                                     STEVE
                         It won't be television!

                                     BARRY
                         It'll be interactive.

                                     STEVE
                         Angus, look, we have a number of 
                         charts here...

                                     BARRY
                         In every home in America the PC will 
                         be where the TV used to be.

                                     STEVE
                         And it'll be a direct connection to 
                         all forms of media.

                                     BARRY
                         An unprecedented transformation of 
                         American social life...

                                     STEVE
                         We'll all become better informed, 
                         more literate, increasingly 
                         productive, and... Well, and, like I 
                         said, we have a number of charts...

               Laura re-enters...

                                     LAURA
                         Sorry to disturb you again, gentlemen, 
                         but... Angus, I'd like to call 
                         security for this one. Though, before 
                         I do, I just wanted to ask just how 
                         marginal the as yet undiscovered 
                         voice of American poetry should be?

                                     ANGUS
                              (thinking)
                         Pretty damn marginal, I'd think.

                                     BARRY
                         Down right controversial, probably.

                                     ANGUS
                         How's he strike you?

                                     LAURA
                         He's been denounced by his local 
                         Board of Education.

                                     BARRY
                         Oh, I read about him in the paper. 
                         Hangs out in a delicatessen somewhere 
                         and writes pornography.

               INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Angus comes out to the water cooler and glares at Simon as 
               he gets a drink.

                                     ANGUS
                         Hello, and why do you think I should 
                         take valuable time out of my busy 
                         schedule to read...

               He grabs the envelope and sees no title.

                                     ANGUS
                         This?

               Simon is stumped. He looks over at Laura, who purses her 
               lips and tilts her head. He twists a button on his shirt, 
               thinking, then returns to Angus.

                                     SIMON
                         Because it's a masterpiece.

                                     ANGUS
                         Really?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     ANGUS
                              (to Laura)
                         Are you hearing this?

                                     LAURA
                         He's adorable.

                                     SIMON
                         I wouldn't want to waste your time.

                                     ANGUS
                         I'm sure you wouldn't and I appreciate 
                         you being so straightforward.

                                     SIMON
                         Thank you.

                                     ANGUS
                         I assume you can take straightforward 
                         criticism?

               Simon looks over at Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         Just say 'Yes'.

                                     SIMON
                              (looking back)
                         Maybe.

                                     ANGUS
                         Get him a coffee, Laura.

                                     LAURA
                         Have a seat, Mr Grim.

                                     ANGUS
                         Hold my calls for the next half hour.

                                     LAURA
                         What about Steve?

                                     ANGUS
                         He doesn't drink coffee. Steve, do 
                         you drink coffee?

                                     STEVE
                              (off)
                         Angus, listen to me!

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Henry paces back and forth. With the fingers of one hand 
               pressed against his forehead and his eyes closed tight in 
               concentration, he dictates to Amy, who is sitting at a table 
               with her laptop computer, typing his every word.

                                     HENRY
                         In the infinite amplitude of his 
                         love, God wants to create the largest 
                         number of best elements that can 
                         exist together in one cosmos... OK.

               Amy types away, fascinated by Henry's intelligence.

                                     HENRY
                         In an instantaneous calculation made 
                         in eternity, God computes the best 
                         possible world and creates it. Fine. 
                         This 'decision' by God is uncontingent 
                         and eternal rather than temporally 
                         or ontologically sequential.

               Stops, zeroing in on his point.

                                     AMY
                         How do you spell that?

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     AMY
                         Ontologically.

                                     HENRY
                         O-N-T... Don't you have some kinda 
                         spell-check on that thing?

                                     AMY
                         Never mind.

                                     HENRY
                         It is impossible for every perfect 
                         good to be compatible with every 
                         other perfect good. The intense beauty 
                         of the mountain must be set off by 
                         the fertility of the plain, so to 
                         speak.

               He smokes, drinks, paces some more. Amy waits with bated 
               breath, devastated by his obscure profundity. He comes back 
               and sits beside her, reaching his conclusion.

                                     HENRY
                         The good of freewill must entail 
                         real choices for sin.

               She gazes at his profile, in love.

               Henry sits thinking and Amy watches him reverently. She leans 
               over close and whispers in his ear. He turns and looks at 
               her, alarmed.

                                     HENRY
                         Listen, Amy, back off. I'm on parole.

                                     AMY
                         You feel the same way. I can tell. I 
                         can see it when you look at me.

               Henry jumps up and looks around, paranoid. He keeps his voice 
               down and points at her.

                                     HENRY
                         Hey! I don't look at you.

                                     AMY
                         Yes you do. In the street. In the 
                         parking lot yesterday. That night on 
                         the highway.

                                     HENRY
                         I look at a lot of people that way.

               Disappointed, Amy turns away and sulks.

                                     AMY
                         You think I'm stupid.

               Henry sees she's genuinely upset and feels bad. He sits back 
               down and lays his hand on hers.

                                     HENRY
                         No, as a matter of fact, I think 
                         you're a real bright kid and I like 
                         that about you.

                                     AMY
                              (looks up, pouts)
                         You do?

               Now Henry tries to scare her away. He leers at her.

                                     HENRY
                         I like it so much I've got half a 
                         mind to do perverse things to you. 
                         Right here. Right now. Things you 
                         might just learn to like.

               She just stares at him, blinks, then looks away and tries to 
               imagine this. She takes her laptop and leaves, confused and 
               blushing.

               Henry watches her go and grins, satisfied with himself.

               INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION -- DAY

               Angus throws on his coat and thrusts the poem at Simon as 
               they walk down the hall.

                                     ANGUS
                         This is really quite unbelievably 
                         bad, my friend. I mean, I'm all for 
                         experimentation and I've made a career 
                         out of a healthy disregard for 
                         convention, but... Look, this is 
                         profoundly irrelevant material. This 
                         is only my opinion. But it's an 
                         opinion I value highly. Goodnight, 
                         Laura. Call Norton Press. We're still 
                         on for tomorrow.

               Simon looks pale as Angus strides towards the elevator.

                                     ANGUS
                         I've been wrong before as a publisher. 
                         But I refuse to admit I've ever been 
                         wrong as a reader. You have talent, 
                         I admit. You have an innate sense of 
                         the musicality of language. A good 
                         ear, maybe. But you do nothing 
                         significant with it. And this twisted 
                         reasoning that poses as... conviction 
                         or insight, it's... well, it's 
                         embarrassing.

               They reach the elevator and stop. Simon tries to catch his 
               breath.

                                     ANGUS
                         Why did you bring this thing to me, 
                         anyway?

                                     SIMON
                              (weakly)
                         A friend of mine spoke of you. He 
                         said you had a lot of integrity.

                                     ANGUS
                         Yes, well, of course, I do. But I'm 
                         not crazy, am I? Who is this person? 
                         Do I know him?

               Simon hesitates, almost decides against it, but then...

                                     SIMON
                         Henry Fool.

               Angus looks back at him.

               Simon waits.

               Angus looks aside, thinks, then shakes his head.

                                     ANGUS
                         Never heard of him.

               Simon just looks at him blankly, confused.

               The doors slide open and Angus gets in the elevator. He's 
               gone. Simon sinks into a chair and stares at the carpet. He 
               is so surprised and hurt he gasps for breath.

               His poem slips from his hand and falls to the floor.

                                     LAURA
                              (off)
                         I remember Henry.

               Simon doesn't register this right away. But then he looks up 
               and over at the receptionist.

               Laura stands and comes around her desk. She pauses, seeing 
               his disappointment, then comes closer and picks up his poem. 
               Handing it to him, she explains...

                                     LAURA
                         He used to be the janitor here.

               He just stares at her, demolished.

               EXT. SIDEWALK/SUBWAY ENTRANCE -- DAY

               Later.

               Simon dumps his poem in a trash can, pauses, then enters the 
               subway.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Henry is leaning on the counter, flipping through pornographic 
               magazines and smoking.

                                     MR DENG
                              (off)
                         Henry, put those magazines back.

                                     HENRY
                         I'm just looking at the pictures.

                                     MR DENG
                         It's not good for you.

               Henry flips through pages and nods, impressed.

                                     HENRY
                         I learn so much from these magazines, 
                         Mr Deng. I refuse to discriminate 
                         between modes of knowing.

                                     MR DENG
                         And you can't smoke in here anymore.

               Henry looks up, outraged.

                                     HENRY
                         Why not!

                                     MR DENG
                         It's the law.

               Henry throws his cigarette to the floor, steps on it and 
               returns to his magazine.

                                     HENRY
                         This place is losing all its charm, 
                         Mr Deng.

                                     MR DENG
                         Business is good. The kids, they 
                         hang out all day and drink coffee, 
                         talk about art and read poetry.

               Henry shakes his head in dismay and studies a centerfold.

                                     HENRY
                         It's just a fad, Mr Deng. These kids 
                         today, they're just slaves to fashion.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Same time.

               Fay comes in, hot and tired from walking around in high heels.

                                     FAY
                         Anybody home? Mom?

               She stands on the stairs and hears the water running in the 
               bathroom.

                                     FAY
                         Ma, that you?

               No answer. She discovers she's out of cigarettes.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Henry is leaning on the counter with a six-pack of beer, 
               pleading with Mr Deng.

                                     HENRY
                         Come on, Mr Deng! How much do I owe 
                         you?

                                     MR DENG
                         Twenty-five dollars.

                                     HENRY
                         That can't be right! And so what? My 
                         credit's good.

               Warren comes in.

                                     WARREN
                         Henry!

                                     HENRY
                         Hey, Warren, you gotta couple of 
                         bucks I can borrow?

               Warren reaches for his wallet.

                                     WARREN
                         Listen, Henry, I wanna remind you to 
                         vote this Thursday.

                                     HENRY
                         Ah, yes, of course. When noble minds 
                         shrink from the task of leadership 
                         scoundrels will rush in to fill the 
                         void.
                              (takes cash)
                         Thanks.

                                     WARREN
                         It's every American's right. A 
                         blessing. Yet another opportunity to 
                         save America from itself.

               Henry pays Mr Deng for his beer.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Fay bangs on the door.

                                     FAY
                         Hey, Henry, you in there? Gimme a 
                         cigarette.

               No answer. She tries the door. It's open. She hesitates.

                                     FAY
                         Henry?

               She goes quietly in.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry steps out of the store and stops when he sees Amy 
               standing there, pouting. He looks away and sighs. Amy picks 
               at the fabric of her stockings and bites her lip.

                                     AMY
                         Henry?

               Henry smokes.

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah.

                                     AMY
                         What kind of... Well, I mean... What 
                         kind of... perverse things would you 
                         do to me?

               It's more than he can stand. He holds his head.

                                     HENRY
                         Take a powder, cupcake.

                                     AMY
                         No, really.

                                     HENRY
                         Evaporate!

               Crushed, she breaks out in tears and flees.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon comes in, furious and throws open the fridge. He finds 
               nothing to eat or drink. He slams the door, then hears the 
               water running in the bathroom upstairs. He stops and listens.

               The bathroom door; the water heard running steadily.

               Simon turns away then sees...

               The poem notebooks face down on the table.

               He thinks.

               The bathroom door; the water heard running...

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry comes into his house, hot and bothered, cradling his 
               six-pack. But he stops, listens, then steps through the 
               kitchen towards the living-room. He stops in the entrance 
               and sees...

               Fay on the floor of the living-room, reading his 'Confession', 
               her mouth hung open in an astonished 'O'.

               He drops his six-pack and...

               She spins around, caught in the act.

               Henry stands in the doorway, pent up, sweating and with 
               perverse things on his mind.

               Fay, her hands palm down on the floor behind her, bites her 
               lip, coquettishly.

               Henry looks her over like she was something good to eat.

               She feels his gaze all over her and twists to one side with 
               a breathless little shudder.

               He steps nearer, stands over her and she looks up at him.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon climbs the stairs to the bathroom...

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry and Fay kissing passionately...

               Same time.

               Simon knocks on the bathroom door.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry and Fay groping and shoving one another as they stagger 
               from room to room.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon bangs on the bathroom door.

               Same time.

               Fay falls to the couch...

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon crashes through the door and finds...

               Mary, kneeling over the edge of the tub, her wrists slit and 
               the blood running down the drain, the shower raining down 
               over her back.

               Simon looks on in horror.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry tears open his trousers...

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon lifts Mary from the bathtub.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry and Fay clutch and grind and heave...

               Same time.

               Simon drags his mother from the bathroom and down the stairs.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry and Fay are making mad, passionate love, oblivious to 
               the world around them.

               INT. GRIM HOUSE DAY -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon drags Mary through the house.

               Same time.

               Henry and Fay fuck.

               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Simon drags Mary out the kitchen door and into the yard, 
               looking desperately for help. He reaches the street, her 
               limp body hanging grotesquely before him, and looks helplessly 
               up and down the block.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CEMETERY -- DAY

               Simon, Henry, Mr Deng, Fay, Gnoc and Buñuel stand with Father 
               Hawkes at the grave.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Let us pray. Lord, grant that peace 
                         be within reach for our friend, Mary. 
                         May the pain and confusion she endured 
                         on earth be fought through in the 
                         after life, so that she may enter 
                         the Kingdom of Heaven and live in 
                         the light of God. Amen.

               He sprinkles holy water on the coffin and they all drop 
               carnations at the grave. Simon and Fay remain there looking 
               down at the coffin. Henry waits for them a few yards away, 
               wishing he could help, but feeling out of place.

               EXT. JUNKYARD -- DAY

               Simon is back working on the garbage truck. He collects 
               garbage and throws it in the truck as Henry, who is just 
               along for the ride, hangs from the side of the truck and 
               pulls the lever whenever Simon tells him to.

                                     HENRY
                         So I was a janitor! So what?

                                     SIMON
                         But Angus James said he didn't even 
                         know you!

               Henry shrugs and qualifies...

                                     HENRY
                         Well, I mean, we weren't like bosom 
                         buddies or anything. But we used to 
                         talk sometimes. In the elevator. In 
                         the morning. He said he liked my 
                         ideas. Being a janitor's a good job 
                         if you're a writer. Especially the 
                         night shift; all that time to think 
                         and develop my ideas.

                                     SIMON
                         Do it.

               Henry pulls the lever and the garbage gets crushed.

                                     SIMON
                         Anyway, he hated my poem.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, what the hell does he know? He 
                         wouldn't know a vital piece of 
                         literary art if it came up and bit 
                         him in the leg. To hell with him! 
                         He's not the only publisher in the 
                         world!

                                     SIMON
                         But nobody likes it.

                                     HENRY
                              (smokes)
                         It's true. A prophet is seldom heeded 
                         in his own land. Remember that.

                                     SIMON
                         Do it.

               Henry is about to pull the lever again, but sees something 
               in amongst the garbage...

                                     HENRY
                         Hey, look, treasure!

               Henry steps down and leans over into the garbage. Simon joins 
               him as he lifts something that is either a ring or a stray 
               piece of machinery.

                                     HENRY
                         What is this?

                                     SIMON
                         Brass maybe. Some kinda copper.

                                     HENRY
                         It's a ring. Jewelry.

                                     SIMON
                         I think it's a gasket. A fitting 
                         from off of that old refrigerator 
                         over there.

               Henry puts it in his pocket, satisfied and Simon jumps on 
               the back of the truck as it turns the corner and rolls away. 
               Henry starts to walk off in the opposite direction, but stops 
               when he sees Pearl age seven.

               EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Henry comes up the street with Pearl age seven on his back. 
               He walks into Vicky's yard and finds Warren lifting weights 
               in the garage.

                                     HENRY
                         Hey, Warren, I found Pearl wandering 
                         around by the garbage dump.

                                     WARREN
                         He lost.

                                     HENRY
                         Who lost?

               Warren rests. He sits up on the bench and takes a toke off 
               the joint he has waiting.

                                     WARREN
                         Congressman Feer.

                                     HENRY
                              (realizing)
                         Oh. Well, you know. Somebody's gotta 
                         lose.

                                     WARREN
                         What's the fucking use. You make 
                         sacrifices. You try to be a decent 
                         human being. Try to contribute 
                         something meaningful to society. And 
                         what happens? They lose to a bunch 
                         of cultural elite liberal fuck-ups. 
                         I don't give a shit anymore. People 
                         deserve what they get.

               Henry pauses, then leads Pearl age seven towards the house. 
               Warren lies back down and continues his lifting.

               INT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry knocks on the door as he enters...

                                     HENRY
                         Vicky?

               No answer. He comes in and finds her sitting on the couch 
               with a drink. She's got a black eye.

                                     HENRY
                         What happened to you?

                                     VICKY
                         He's a good man, Henry. Nobody's 
                         perfect.

                                     HENRY
                         I guess not.

                                     VICKY
                         He's terribly disappointed.

                                     HENRY
                         I found Pearl wandering around with 
                         no shoes on her feet.

               Pearl comes over and stands beside her mother.

                                     VICKY
                         Thanks. She gets scared.

                                     HENRY
                         And you don't?

               Vicky caresses Pearl's hair, then drinks and looks over at 
               Henry.

                                     VICKY
                         I love him.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Buñuel is waiting when Henry walks in and steps up to the 
               beer cooler.

                                     HENRY
                              (alarmed)
                         Where's the beer?

                                     MR DENG
                         No more beer. Coffee. Espresso! 
                         Cappuccino! Café au lait. Carrot 
                         juice. Herbal tea.

               Henry looks at the man, disgusted, then falls in to a seat 
               and motions to Gnoc, who is now the waitress.

                                     HENRY
                         A double espresso and a jelly donut, 
                         Gnoc.
                              (to Buñuel)
                         You mind paying? My credit's no good 
                         here anymore, apparently.

                                     BUÑUEL
                              (nods amiably)
                         Did you go to the employment agency 
                         today, Henry?

                                     HENRY
                         No, but it's OK. Simon's gunna try 
                         to get me a job on the garbage truck.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Listen, I'm a little concerned about 
                         your friend.

                                     HENRY
                         Simon?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Seems he gave an obscene note to a 
                         girl in the library.

                                     HENRY
                         Get outta here! When?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         I'm not sure.

                                     HENRY
                         It couldn't have been Simon.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         It almost certainly is. He mentions 
                         you. Look...

               He unfolds a print-out of the letter. Henry reads and Buñuel 
               leans over, pointing out...

                                     HENRY
                         'Her figure makes me violent. I want 
                         to somehow break her. But tenderly. 
                         How is this possible? Ask Henry.'

               Henry thinks this over, gulps back some espresso and nods 
               his approval. Then...

                                     HENRY
                         Buñuel, this is obviously a love 
                         letter.

                                     BUÑUEL
                              (taking it back)
                         We've had complaints.

                                     HENRY
                         Where did you get it?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         She posted it on the Internet.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, the slut!

                                     BUÑUEL
                         She was trying to warn other girls 
                         about a potential rapist.

                                     HENRY
                              (smokes)
                         Is all this true about the Internet? 
                         About how you can get pornography on 
                         it?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Well, yeah, sure. It's a big problem. 
                         You can send dirty pictures and 
                         everything.

                                     HENRY
                         On the Internet?

                                     BUÑUEL
                         Yeah.

               Henry is impressed.

                                     HENRY
                         No kiddin'?

               Buñuel gets up to go.

                                     BUÑUEL
                         See you on Thursday, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                              (thinking)
                         Sure. See you.
                              (calls the waitress)
                         Gnoc, gimme one of these double 
                         espressos to go, will ya?

               He is having ideas.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Fay, still dressed in black, is tapping away on the keys to 
               the computer, surfing the Internet, as Henry appears at the 
               kitchen door, gripping his tall double espresso.

                                     HENRY
                         Hello, Fay.

                                     FAY
                         Go away.

                                     HENRY
                         You gotta get outta the house, Fay. 
                         You can't blame yourself for not 
                         being here. You did all you could 
                         for her.

               She turns and glares at him.

                                     FAY
                         Is there something you want?

               Henry stops, pauses, looks away. Then...

                                     HENRY
                         You got the Internet on that 
                         contraption?

                                     FAY
                              (resumes typing)
                         Yeah. So what?

               He changes the subject again, preoccupied and continues 
               tenderly...

                                     HENRY
                         Look Fay, about, you know, between 
                         us -- what happened...

                                     FAY
                         I don't wanna talk about it, Henry!

               He sighs and drinks his coffee, then looks back at her.

                                     HENRY
                         Type a part of Simon's poem onto the 
                         Internet.

                                     FAY
                              (stops)
                         What?

                                     HENRY
                         Go ahead.

                                     FAY
                         No.

                                     HENRY
                         Why not?

                                     FAY
                         Because.

                                     HENRY
                         Come on, Fay. It's a great idea.

                                     FAY
                         I don't know if he would want us to 
                         do that.

                                     HENRY
                         Sure he would. Just the first ten 
                         verses.

               Fay is tempted.

                                     FAY
                         I don't know.

                                     HENRY
                         He'll thank you for it later.

               Frowning, she reconsiders. She gets up and takes the notebooks 
               from the cabinet above the fridge. She flips through the 
               pages but suddenly stops and turns to the door with a nicer 
               attitude.

                                     FAY
                         Henry...

               But he's gone. It's as if he has vanished into thin air. She 
               sighs, sits back down, and begins typing the poem onto the 
               Internet.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry comes back into the store, satisfied with himself. He 
               finishes off his coffee, tosses away the cup and takes a 
               pornographic magazine from the rack. He leans on the counter 
               where Mr Deng is busy working and flips through the pages.

                                     HENRY
                         Gimme another one of those tall double 
                         espressos, Mr Deng.

               Mr Deng starts to make him one and sees him with the magazine.

                                     MR DENG
                         You gunna buy that?

                                     HENRY
                         I'm just looking.

                                     MR DENG
                         Well then put it back.

                                     HENRY
                         There's this fascinating story about 
                         a famous rock band and how they tied 
                         a friend of theirs to a bed in their 
                         hotel room and inserted a live fish 
                         into her vagina.

               Mr Deng shakes his head and frowns.

                                     HENRY
                              (explains)
                         They say she had numerous orgasms.

                                     MR DENG
                         Henry, you need to do something with 
                         your life. Get a job, or something.

                                     HENRY
                         I mean, it wasn't the entire fish, 
                         it was just, you know, the nose. The 
                         nose of the fish.

               Mr Deng brings over the coffee. Henry is surprised to notice 
               he is not riveted.

                                     HENRY
                         You don't find that interesting?

                                     MR DENG
                         No.

               Henry closes the magazine and puts it back. Leaning on the 
               counter, he sips his coffee and ponders.

                                     HENRY
                         You ever wonder what it would be 
                         like to have sex with an animal, Mr 
                         Deng?

                                     MR DENG
                         That coffee is free. Just take it 
                         and get out of here.

                                     HENRY
                         I mean, some dogs are almost as big 
                         as people and often more attractive.

               Mr Deng just goes back to work, leaving Henry there at the 
               counter thinking big thoughts.

               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- EVENING

               Simon hangs from the garbage truck as it comes up the street 
               and pauses in front of his house. He jumps down and the truck 
               barrels away.

               INT. FAY'S ROOM -- EVENING

               Simon taps at the door. She looks over at him and he sees 
               she's been crying. He comes into the room and she sits up on 
               the edge of the bed.

                                     SIMON
                         Did you see him?

                                     FAY
                         He came by this afternoon.

                                     SIMON
                         Did you talk?

                                     FAY
                         No.

               He comes over and sits beside her. He thinks a moment, then...

                                     SIMON
                         You've got to tell him, Fay.

                                     FAY
                         He thinks I'm a slut.

               And she starts crying again. Simon awkwardly touches her 
               shoulder, then moves his hand away. Fay pulls herself 
               together, sniffles and goes into the bathroom.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE, AT THE PIANO

               Moments later.

               Simon comes downstairs and finds Henry at the piano. He looks 
               ill and is clutching a nearly empty container of espresso. 
               He is staring sickly at 'the ring'.

                                     SIMON
                         Henry?

                                     HENRY
                         Simon, I don't feel so good.

                                     SIMON
                         What's wrong?

                                     HENRY
                         I feel all kinda clammy. And damp.

               Simon lifts the coffee container and smells it.

                                     SIMON
                         How many of these did you have?

               Henry tries to remember. He squints.

                                     HENRY
                         Seven.

               Simon puts the container down and sits at the table.

                                     SIMON
                         Henry, we have to talk.

                                     HENRY
                         Can I use your toilet?

                                     SIMON
                         Fay's taking a shower.

               Henry grabs his stomach. He presses his hand against his 
               chest, holds his head, then stares at the ring.

                                     HENRY
                         How much you think I can get for 
                         this?

               He looks at Simon.

                                     SIMON
                              (pauses)
                         Henry, Fay's pregnant.

               Henry looks at him.

                                     SIMON
                         Fay's pregnant with your child.

               Henry lets this sink in. He stands and the room tilts. White 
               with fear, he clutches at his rumbling gut.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE BATHROOM

               Moments later.

               Fay is in the shower as...

               Henry bursts into the bathroom, tearing at his belt and 
               trousers. She starts screaming and wraps herself in the shower 
               curtain. He drops his pants and throws himself on the toilet 
               just in time to begin shitting his brains out. Fay crouches, 
               terrified and disgusted, in the shower.

                                     FAY
                         Jesus, Henry!

               Henry sweats and moans as he empties his bowels in a violent 
               and messy blast of noise and foul air.

               Fay covers her face and whimpers sickly.

               Finally, he's done. He hangs with his face out over his knees, 
               sick, exhausted and in shock. Fay wraps herself in a towel 
               and steps out of the shower. She creeps carefully around him 
               and flushes the toilet, growing increasingly concerned.

                                     FAY
                         Hey, Henry. You OK?

               He is destroyed, staring down at...

               The 'ring' he still holds in his hand.

               Fay sees this, looks at Henry, then kneels and takes it from 
               him. He doesn't resist. She lifts it up and breathlessly 
               admires it. Totally misunderstanding, moved beyond words...

                                     FAY
                         Oh. Oh, Henry.

               And she throws her arms around him as he sits there, sweating 
               and spent, on the toilet.

               INT. CHURCH -- DAY

               A month later.

               Mr Deng and Buñuel drag Henry, kicking and screaming, into 
               the church foyer. Once inside, he shakes them off and they 
               stand back. He huffs and puffs and tosses the hair back out 
               of his eyes. He paces back and forth like a caged animal, 
               then stops, sees...

               Fay, at the altar, waiting with Simon. She is beautiful.

               Henry calms down, deeply affected.

               Fay smiles down the aisle at him.

               Henry throws back his shoulders, straightens his tie and 
               strides up the aisle.

               Also present at the ceremony are Vicky and Warren. Gnoc is 
               maid of honor.

               INT. CHURCH -- DAY

               Later.

               Henry holds Fay's hand and repeats after Father Hawkes.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my 
                         wife.

                                     HENRY
                         I, Henry, take you, Fay to be my 
                         wife.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         And do promise before God and these 
                         witnesses...

                                     HENRY
                         And do promise before God and these 
                         witnesses...

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         To be your loving and faithful 
                         husband.

                                     HENRY
                         To be your loving and faithful 
                         husband.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         In plenty and in want.

                                     HENRY
                         In plenty and in want.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         In joy and in sorrow.

                                     HENRY
                         In joy and in sorrow.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         In sickness and in health.

                                     HENRY
                         In sickness and in health.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         For as long as we both shall live.

                                     HENRY
                         For as long as we both shall live.

               The gasket everyone is now mistaking for a ring is lifted 
               high before the altar.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Bless, O Lord, this ring, that he 
                         who gives it and she who wears it 
                         may abide in your peace and continue 
                         in your favor until their life's 
                         end.

               The gasket is placed on Fay's finger.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Whom God has joined, let no man 
                         separate.

               The doors of the church swing open with a tremendous creak 
               and everyone turns from the altar to see...

               Amy enter. She steps in and stands there, alarmed, clutching 
               a long scroll of fax paper.

                                     HENRY
                         Oh, shit.

                                     FAY
                         Simon, do something.

               Simon walks down the aisle to see to Amy.

               The guests watch and wait.

               As Simon reaches her, Amy looks away from the altar and shows 
               him the fax scroll.

                                     AMY
                         Look.

               He studies the fax and recognizes his poem. He grows 
               concerned.

                                     SIMON
                         Where did you get this?

                                     AMY
                         It's all over the Internet.

               Simon looks up the aisle at...

               Fay and Henry. They look away, caught.

                                     AMY
                         They're even talking about it on the 
                         TV news.

               Confused, Simon starts for the door, shoving the fax in his 
               pocket. Fay steps down from the altar...

                                     FAY
                         Simon?

               Amy hurries along beside him.

                                     AMY
                         There's a guy from the radio station 
                         over at World of Donuts and a story 
                         in the newspaper about some kids 
                         burning down a school near Boston!

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Later that evening.

               The whole neighborhood is celebrating Fay's wedding. The 
               music is loud. The people are drunk. The place is a shambles. 
               A big dance number is playing. Amidst all the festivities, 
               though, Simon and Buñuel have the small TV propped up on top 
               of the fridge, following the evening news...

                                     REPORTER
                              (on TV)
                         It all started right here in Queens, 
                         Jim, at World of Donuts about one 
                         year ago today, when local garbage 
                         man, Simon Grim, put pencil to paper 
                         and began to compose what many have 
                         come to regard as vicious, antisocial 
                         and pornographic poetry -- 112 lines 
                         of unrhymed free meter verse which 
                         would one day serve to spark the 
                         flames of controversy across the 
                         nation and -- indeed -- the world.

               Fay leads the neighbors in the dance...

                                     OWEN FEER
                              (on TV)
                         This is outrageous! Measures must be 
                         taken. Have we debased our culture 
                         to such an extent that a garbage man 
                         with a head full of sick ideas is 
                         legitimately referred to as a poet, 
                         and where the filth he spews can be 
                         accessed by any child old enough to 
                         turn on a computer? Is this what we 
                         have come to? Not the transmission 
                         of our highest ideals, but a cynical, 
                         atheistic delirium!

               Henry and Fay dance, surrounded by the dancing neighbors...

                                     POET LAUREATE
                              (on TV)
                         Poetry of this kind, and this poem 
                         in particular, is, I think, a worthy 
                         form of desperation; a digression on 
                         the extremes of human experience; of 
                         solitude, of community. It is perhaps 
                         alarming, even upsetting to some -- 
                         myself included -- but it must be 
                         allowed to exist.

               Henry throws an arm around Warren, who stands looking dejected 
               in the doorway, and raises his glass to the happiness in the 
               room.

                                     ANCHORMAN
                              (on TV)
                         Meanwhile, in Rome today, the Pope 
                         issued a message of hope for believers 
                         in their fight against what he termed 
                         the godless and lost. He did not 
                         mention Simon Grim by name, but 
                         offered a prayer for the young whom 
                         he described as sadly in need of 
                         faith and not the illusion of 
                         conviction offered by rock music, 
                         drugs and contemporary poetry.

               The TV is switched off. It's later now. People are passed 
               out on the kitchen floor and various neighbors are sitting 
               around the table. Fay steps back from the TV, drains a glass 
               of beer and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her wedding 
               gown. She hugs Simon, who is deeply unsettled by the news of 
               his growing infamy.

                                     FAY
                         God, Simon, I mean, like, you're a 
                         total fucking rock star.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               A huge crowd of kids are pressed up against the doors, trying 
               to get a peek at their hero, Simon Grim.

               Angus comes away from the window. He stands and regards Simon, 
               who is sitting at a table tearing a napkin to shreds.

                                     ANGUS
                         I'm willing to negotiate, Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         I know, it's just...

                                     ANGUS
                         You've had other offers.

                                     SIMON
                         Well, yes. But.

                                     ANGUS
                         What?

                                     SIMON
                         Why have you reconsidered?

                                     ANGUS
                         Because I think your writing will be 
                         tremendously successful.

                                     SIMON
                         But you don't like it?

                                     ANGUS
                         It's growing on me.

                                     SIMON
                         What made you change your mind?

               He points to the fans outside.

                                     ANGUS
                         Other people's responses. I don't 
                         live in a vacuum, you know. Two months 
                         ago I didn't have the proof of your 
                         poem's appeal. Now I do.

               Simon thinks this over, but says nothing. Angus comes over 
               and lays his hand on his shoulder.

                                     ANGUS
                         Consider my offer carefully. Get 
                         some professional advice. I'll call 
                         you tomorrow.

               Simon nods.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Angus emerges and has to fight his way through the throng of 
               excited adolescents. He reaches his limo and gets in. But he 
               pauses before closing the door and considers the crowd.

               Simon emerges from the store and kids begin screaming and 
               shouting for autographs. Angus shakes his head, impressed.

               INT. CHURCH -- DAY

               Simon consults Father Hawkes.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         What were the terms?

                                     SIMON
                         A hundred thousand in cash up front.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Royalties?

                                     SIMON
                         A seventy/thirty split.

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Well, that could be better. But it 
                         is a hundred thousand dollars up 
                         front. Guaranteed money. You could 
                         use that.

                                     SIMON
                         So it's a good deal?

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         Of course it's good.

                                     SIMON
                         So I should take it?

                                     FATHER HAWKES
                         No. Try to get him up to a hundred 
                         and fifty thousand.

               EXT. JUNKYARD -- DAY

               Evening.

               Henry stalks along, all fired up. Simon tries his best to 
               keep up with him.

                                     HENRY
                         I've let myself down, Simon! I've 
                         let myself be caught in the bloody 
                         maw of banal necessity! How did I 
                         get here? How did this happen to me? 
                         I'm going to be somebody's father! I 
                         need time to think. To write. Time 
                         to finish my 'Confession'! I can't 
                         work for a living! It's impossible! 
                         I tried once. My genius will be wasted 
                         trying to make ends meet!

               He collapses extravagantly.

                                     HENRY
                         This is how great men topple, Simon. 
                         Their hearts are in the right place 
                         too much of the time! They get 
                         sidetracked! Distracted. Oh! How 
                         could I have been so careless!

                                     SIMON
                         Henry, please, let me read the 
                         'Confession'.

                                     HENRY
                         No. Not now. It's not done. I'm all 
                         washed up. I'm finished!

                                     SIMON
                         Angus James is convinced my poem is 
                         going to make him incredibly wealthy. 
                         He'll read your book and seriously 
                         consider publishing it. If I ask him 
                         to. I'm certain.

               Henry glances back at his friend, digesting this. He thinks 
               it over, then...

                                     HENRY
                         Really? You really think so?

               Having finally got through to him, Simon comes forward, 
               anxious to help Henry.

                                     SIMON
                         I'll insist he publish the 
                         'Confession'.

               He paces back and forth, thrusting out his chest, for the 
               first time in his life displaying something like pride or 
               arrogance.

                                     SIMON
                              (adds)
                         Or I won't let him publish my poem.

               Henry sits there watching Simon, impressed with this evidence 
               of increased self-esteem. He realizes the profundity of the 
               gesture.

                                     HENRY
                         You'd do that? You'd do that for me?

               Simon stares off into the distance.

                                     SIMON
                         You saved my life.

               Henry is moved. He stands and comes forward. He grabs his 
               friend by the shoulders and turns him around.

                                     HENRY
                         Do you realize what you're saying?

                                     SIMON
                              (pausing)
                         I owe you everything.

               Henry steps away, considering, then looks back at Simon and 
               extends his hand.

                                     HENRY
                         OK.

               Simon smiles. Henry smiles. They shake hands.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Simon enters, comes forward into the room and pauses, looking 
               off at...

               The stack of twelve books that comprise the 'Confession'.

               EXT. HOUSE/BACKYARD -- DAY

               Henry stands outside, watching his door.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               Simon lifts the first volume, opens it and begins reading. 
               He sits.

               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY

               Henry paces, drinking and smoking nervously.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Simon strides the length of the living room, reading. He 
               stops, frowns.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

               Simon reads in front of the fire.

               EXT. BACKYARD/GARAGE -- NIGHT

               Buñuel, Hawkes and Mr Deng sleep sitting up as Henry talks 
               to himself. Fay leans out the back door and interrupts him. 
               He looks at her, but says nothing. She sighs and goes back 
               inside: turning off the lights.

               INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY

               The next morning.

               Simon sits wearily reading the final page of volume twelve 
               as the morning sun streaks into the room. Finally, he finishes 
               and slowly closes the book. He stands and crosses the room. 
               Leaning against the wall, he removes his glasses and rubs 
               his aching eyes.

               EXT. BACKYARD -- DAY

               Simon steps out of Henry's apartment and sees Henry asleep 
               on the back stoop.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Simon stares into a glass of water. Fay sits ten feet away, 
               waiting. Finally...

                                     FAY
                         It's really that bad?

                                     SIMON
                         It's terrible.

               INT. ANGUS JAMES' OFFICE -- DAY

               The 'Confession' lies on the big desk. Angus' hand comes 
               down upon it.

                                     ANGUS
                         You've read this?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     ANGUS
                         And you want me to consider publishing 
                         it?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     ANGUS
                         As part of our deal?

                                     SIMON
                         Yes.

                                     ANGUS
                         Simon, this book, it's... It's really 
                         quite bad.

                                     SIMON
                         That's what you said about my poem.

               Angus pauses and figures. He changes the subject.

                                     ANGUS
                         I'm offering you a very real 
                         expression of my faith in your 
                         writing. Two hundred thousand dollars 
                         and a sixty/forty split.

                                     SIMON
                         But just exactly what is the nature 
                         of your faith in my writing?

                                     ANGUS
                         Look, Simon, you don't require my 
                         admiration. You require my experience 
                         as a publisher. And that experience 
                         leads me to believe your poem will 
                         make more money than any book of 
                         poetry ever published. In history. 
                         Virtually make you a household name 
                         within two years. You'll never have 
                         to work on a garbage truck again, I 
                         assure you. Or do anything else for 
                         that matter. Whereas this 'Confession' 
                         by Henry Fool...

               He is at a loss for words.

                                     ANGUS
                         The most I can say for this is... 
                         The man is a scoundrel.

                                     SIMON
                         He taught me everything I know.

                                     ANGUS
                         No! He encouraged all that was 
                         expressive in you to become manifest. 
                         He inspired you to act. He influenced 
                         your perception.

               Simon waits a while, staring at his shoes.

                                     SIMON
                         How about if my advance is only a 
                         hundred thousand?

                                     ANGUS
                         It's not about money, Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         We could split the royalties 
                         seventy/thirty.

                                     ANGUS
                         I will not publish Henry Fool's 
                         'Confession'.

               Simon sits and lets this sink in. Angus waits, then...

                                     ANGUS
                         Will you sign the contract?

               Simon continues looking out at the city. Angus waits, but 
               there is no response. Finally, Simon turns, pauses and slowly 
               crosses the room.

               He sits at the table and looks down at the contract.

               He signs.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Fay is in labor. Henry helps her into her coat as they rush 
               for the door.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry runs into the store and stands there, panicked, looking 
               at Hawkes, Buñuel and Mr Deng. Gnoc runs out to get Fay.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Henry and Gnoc load Fay into the van. The van pulls out.

               INT. VAN -- DAY

               Henry drives recklessly. Fay rolls around in the back.

               INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR -- DAY

               Fay is in a wheelchair being rushed down the hall. She is 
               gripping Henry's hand as he runs along beside her.

               INT. HOSPITAL DELIVERY ROOM -- DAY

               Fay gasps and sweats as the Doctor and Nurse prepare her. 
               She is scared. She looks over at...

               Henry, looking in through the window. He looks scared too.

               Fay is sedated by gas.

               Henry is taken away by the Nurse.

               Fay stares up at the ceiling.

               INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT

               Henry is asleep on a row of waiting-room chairs, exhausted.

               Simon comes running up the hall and finds him. It's late and 
               no one is around. He sits down beside Henry and shakes him.

               Henry wakes.

                                     HENRY
                         Simon? You're here.

               He sits up and Simon sits beside him.

                                     SIMON
                         What happened?

                                     HENRY
                              (coughs)
                         It's a boy.

                                     SIMON
                         And Fay?

                                     HENRY
                         She's alright.

               Simon sits back, relieved. Then he remembers the rain-soaked 
               shopping bag he has with him. He pulls out a couple of cans 
               of beer and hands one to Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Thanks.

               They look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the 
               coast is clear. Then they pop open the beers and toast.

               They drink. Then...

                                     HENRY
                         How did it go?

               Simon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room. He 
               looks out of the window and gathers his strength.

                                     SIMON
                         Listen, Henry, Angus James didn't 
                         like your 'Confession'.

               Henry looks at Simon blankly, then blinks and looks away.

                                     HENRY
                         Ah. I see. Well, what now?

                                     SIMON
                         What do you mean?

                                     HENRY
                         Did he suggest changes?

               Silence. Simon comes back and sits again.

                                     SIMON
                         No. He didn't.

                                     HENRY
                         I mean, after all, there are things 
                         I can do to make it more accessible.

                                     SIMON
                         Accessible?

                                     HENRY
                         I can soften up some of the language 
                         and make it read easier. Take out 
                         some of the more intratextual 
                         references and popularize the 
                         underlying Sturm und Drang, so to 
                         speak. I can change its mode. Make 
                         it more of a conventional novel 
                         instead.

               Simon just stares at him blankly, then sighs and shakes his 
               head.

                                     SIMON
                         No. Don't.

                                     HENRY
                              (laughing)
                         Oh, Simon, don't be such a purist! I 
                         appreciate your protectiveness, but 
                         the integrity of the work gives it a 
                         durability that can sustain such 
                         things.

               Simon comes over and lays his hand on Henry's shoulder.

                                     SIMON
                         No. Really, Henry. Don't.

                                     HENRY
                         What are you saying; that it doesn't 
                         merit revision?

                                     SIMON
                         I'm saying... Angus James didn't 
                         like it.

               He steps away and sits. Henry pauses, then approaches and 
               leans down over him.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, did you tell him what you think?

                                     SIMON
                         What I think doesn't matter.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes, it does. You've got to use your 
                         influence with him.

                                     SIMON
                         I gave it to him to read and he hated 
                         it. What more can I do?

                                     HENRY
                         You can refuse to let him publish 
                         your poem.

                                     SIMON
                         I can't do that.

                                     HENRY
                         You said you would.

                                     SIMON
                         That was before I read your book.

                                     HENRY
                              (hit hard)
                         Oh.

                                     SIMON
                              (looking up at him)
                         I signed the contract, Henry.

               Henry stands there a moment longer, then lowers himself into 
               the nearest seat, weakened.

                                     SIMON
                         Look, Henry, what did you expect?

                                     HENRY
                         I... I don't know. Honesty, perhaps.

                                     SIMON
                              (indignantly)
                         Look, if I had told you, when at 
                         first I read it, that I thought it 
                         was no good, what would you have 
                         done?

                                     HENRY
                         I would have respected your opinion.

                                     SIMON
                         And insisted that there's no 
                         accounting for taste.

                                     HENRY
                         Well, is there?

               Simon's words catch in his throat. He turns away, frustrated.

                                     SIMON
                         I don't know. I didn't bring it to 
                         Angus because I thought it was good. 
                         I brought it to Angus because you're 
                         my friend.

                                     HENRY
                              (staggered)
                         Oh how perfectly enormous of you, 
                         Simon.

                                     SIMON
                              (explodes)
                         Look, Henry, I did it! I wrote. I 
                         wrote poetry because you told me to! 
                         I worked! I worked while you sat 
                         back and comfortably dismissed the 
                         outside world as too shallow, stupid 
                         and mean to appreciate your ideas.

                                     HENRY
                         Is that such a priority? Is that 
                         some sort of measure of a man's worth? 
                         To drag what's best in him out into 
                         the street so every average slob 
                         with some pretense to taste can poke 
                         it with a stick?

                                     SIMON
                              (sits, tired)
                         Maybe. Maybe it is.

               Henry just stares at him, stands, then turns on his heel and 
               waves him off.

                                     HENRY
                         You must be pretty impressed with 
                         yourself, huh? The all too obviously 
                         talented new man, the important new 
                         voice, the early clue to a new 
                         direction, or whatever, etc., etc., 
                         etc! A popular new trend conveniently 
                         packaged for the distracted young 
                         herd! You want to be liked more than 
                         you know, Simon Grim! You'd be nowhere 
                         without me and you know it.

               Simon hangs his head, destroyed.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm leaving.

               Henry is scared all of a sudden. But he puts on a defiant 
               exterior.

                                     HENRY
                         Yes. It's time you left.

               He stands, drinks and walks over to the window...

                                     HENRY
                         I saw you for what you were in the 
                         beginning, Simon. I hold no grudge 
                         and I'm certain you will, in time, 
                         leave some serious and small dent in 
                         this world.

                                     SIMON
                              (weakly)
                         The world is full of shit.

               Henry take advantage of Simon's disillusionment and puts on 
               a big show of secure wisdom.

                                     HENRY
                         The world is full of shit. It's true. 
                         And you have to walk through it. 
                         That's your part. I'm sorry. But 
                         you're no good at it. Perhaps I'm 
                         not. Perhaps I wasn't made to walk 
                         through shit. Go on now. Leave. Do 
                         what you're good at. Go.

               Simon sits there a moment, numb with grief. Henry, red in 
               the face, stares at the floor. Suddenly, Simon stands and 
               walks out. Henry looks up and watches him go. He can hardly 
               believe it. He almost raises his voice and apologizes, but 
               can't. He lowers his head again and covers his face with his 
               hands, listening to Simon's footsteps receding through the 
               halls.

               Simon walks on, away from us, down the hospital corridor.

                                                              FADE TO BLACK

               EXT. STREET -- DAY

               Seven years later.

               Fay bangs out of the kitchen door with her seven-year-old 
               son Ned. Frazzled and overworked, she grips a loaded laundry 
               basket to her side as she sits Ned down on the curb and points 
               at him.

                                     FAY
                         Play!

               The kid sits still, obviously guilty of some unspeakable 
               mischief, as Fay storms back into the house. He looks around, 
               bored, then brightens up when he sees...

               Henry, coming up the street, hanging from the back of a 
               garbage truck.

               INT. THE INFERNO -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry enters with Ned on his back and the bartender, Patty, 
               goes ballistic.

                                     PATTY
                         Henry, what did I tell you about 
                         bringing the kid in here!

                                     HENRY
                         Say hello to Patty, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Hi.

               She suddenly becomes all soft and cuddly.

                                     PATTY
                         How you doin', sweetie? You wanna 
                         Coke?

               He nods and Henry stands him on a stool at the bar.

                                     HENRY
                         So what did you learn at school today, 
                         Ned? Anything?

               He shakes his head.

                                     HENRY
                         Here, I'll teach you something.

               He hands Ned a cigarette and lights it for him. Ned takes a 
               drag and coughs.

                                     HENRY
                         Horrible, isn't it?

               Ned nods in agreement.

                                     NED
                         It burns.

                                     HENRY
                         See. That'll teach ya. Here, sip 
                         this.

               And he offers the kid his whiskey.

               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Same time.

               Fay comes out of the house and looks for her son.

                                     FAY
                         Ned!

               She comes out to the street and looks around.

                                     FAY
                         Ned!

               EXT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- DAY

               Fay comes up looking for Ned and sees...

               Pearl, age fourteen, come out of Vicky's House. She is 
               fourteen years old now. Warren steps out the door and grabs 
               her by the arm. She shakes him off. He slaps her.

               She runs down the steps and glares back at him.

                                     WARREN
                              (pointing at her)
                         I'm warning you, Pearl!

               Pearl turns defiantly away and walks into the street.

               INT. THE INFERNO -- DAY

               Same time.

               Henry is teaching Ned how to tip a topless dancer. A dancer 
               stands on the bar and stretches her garter as Ned slips a 
               dollar bill in beneath it.

                                     HENRY
                         That's it. That's it. Perfect!

               Some other guy down the bar is reading a newspaper...

                                     BILL
                         Hey, Fool, it's about your friend -- 
                         what's his name. Your brother-in-
                         law.

               Henry looks over. The guy, Bill, shows him the article.

                                     HENRY
                         What about him?

                                     BILL
                              (reading)
                         The controversial and reclusive 
                         American poet Simon Grim has been 
                         awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
                         The Swedish Academy, who will confer 
                         the award late next week, praised Mr 
                         Grim for works of great and difficult 
                         striving, for the rendering of the 
                         desperate, the ugly and the mundane 
                         in a language packed with our shared 
                         human frailties...

                                     HENRY
                         God, they must be hard up for geniuses 
                         to pin medals on because, listen, I 
                         gotta tell you, when I first met 
                         this guy he didn't even know what an 
                         iambic pentameter was.

                                     BILL
                         He's a fraud.

                                     HENRY
                         Keep a lid on it, Bill, you're outta 
                         your league.

                                     BILL
                         Stir things up so as to stay in the 
                         newspapers. That's his racket.

                                     HENRY
                         He's a great American poet, you dumb 
                         fuck!

                                     BILL
                         Poet, my ass! I could puke all over 
                         a piece a loose leaf and be more 
                         profound than he is!

                                     HENRY
                         Come over here and say that and I'll 
                         cripple ya in three different ways, 
                         you boozed-up Philistine!

                                     FAY
                         Henry!

               Henry and Ned crouch and quiver -- caught. Fay strides up to 
               the bar and grabs the kid.

                                     FAY
                         Listen, you degenerate, I've had 
                         about enough of this!
                              (smells Ned's breath)
                         Ned, have you been drinking?

               The kid checks with Henry then looks back at Fay and nods. 
               Fay looks at her husband, outraged.

                                     HENRY
                              (explains)
                         His throat hurt from smoking.

               Fay slaps him across the face -- hard -- and the place goes 
               quiet. Henry shakes his head clear and she pokes him in the 
               chest with her finger.

                                     FAY
                         Henry, don't come home tonight! I'm 
                         warning you! Don't come home at all! 
                         Ever!

               And she storms out with the kid. Henry snaps his jaw back 
               into place, then looks at Patty and Bill and shrugs. He knocks 
               back his drink and motions for another.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- NIGHT

               Later (evening).

               Henry staggers out of the back door of the Inferno and comes 
               across Mr Deng sitting against the wall of the store, watching 
               the basketball game on a small TV. World of Donuts vibrates 
               with loud music.

                                     HENRY
                         Who's winning?

                                     MR DENG
                         Nobody.

               Henry gestures to World of Donuts...

                                     HENRY
                         What's going on in there?

                                     MR DENG
                         We gotta have rock 'n' roll shows 
                         these days, Henry. The poetry readings 
                         just don't pay the bills no more.

                                     HENRY
                         What did I tell you! It was just a 
                         fad. I told you that! I told everyone!

                                     MR DENG
                         Did you hear about Simon? It was on 
                         the news today.

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah yeah yeah. So what? A Nobel 
                         Prize. Anybody can get one of them 
                         these days. That's the problem, with 
                         this world, Mr Deng... Nobody's got 
                         any standards anymore. You seen Fay?

                                     MR DENG
                         You better sleep in my office tonight, 
                         Henry. She was very angry. You've 
                         gotta let her cool off.

                                     HENRY
                         I can't sleep in there with that 
                         racket!

                                     MR DENG
                         Suit yourself.

               Henry considers his options, then...

               INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT

               The place is abandoned.

               Henry comes in and, just as he is laying down to go to sleep 
               on an old couch, finds Pearl age fourteen.

               She is hardened and disturbed, but frequently vulnerable and 
               scared; a troubled kid.

                                     HENRY
                         What are you doing here, Pearl?

                                     PEARL
                         You want some?

                                     HENRY
                              (pauses)
                         Some what?

               Pearl comes towards him. He is kneeling with his face at her 
               crotch level when she reaches him. She holds out a bottle of 
               cheap rot-gut wine. Realizing, he takes it and drinks. He 
               winces.

                                     HENRY
                         Shit!

               Pearl laughs and falls back onto the couch, her sweater 
               hanging off her shoulder and her skirt hiked up and displaying 
               her underwear.

               Henry stands and searches for something to sit on.

                                     PEARL
                         Come sit here.

               She pats the couch beside her.

               He comes over, eyeing her carefully and sits. He hands back 
               the bottle. She drinks, winces and sits staring at the flames.

                                     PEARL
                         That's what my dad always says.

                                     HENRY
                         What?

                                     PEARL
                              (dead)
                         'You want some?'

               Henry looks away, uncomfortable. She slides her gaze over to 
               him, their eyes meet, and she pins him to the spot.

                                     PEARL
                         People say you were once in jail for 
                         having sex with a girl my age.

                                     HENRY
                         That was a long time ago.

               He gets up and stands at the window. Pearl age fourteen 
               watches him closely as she drinks, then...

                                     PEARL
                         You want some?

               He looks over at her and she slides her coat off her shoulder. 
               Henry is sweating.

                                     HENRY
                         You oughta get outta here, Pearl.

                                     PEARL
                         I was here first.

                                     HENRY
                         Go home.

                                     PEARL
                         You go home.

                                     HENRY
                         Fine.

               And he starts to leave. But Pearl sits up...

                                     PEARL
                              (scared)
                         Wait!

               Henry stops and looks back at her.

                                     PEARL
                              (hanging her head)
                         I can't go home.

                                     HENRY
                              (concerned)
                         Why not?

                                     PEARL
                         He beat her up again.

               Henry holds his head, tries to sober up. He looks around the 
               room, then focuses on the girl.

                                     HENRY
                         Warren beat up your mom?

               Pearl stares at the floor. She glances over at him, then 
               back down at the bottle gripped in her hands. She nods.

               Henry pauses, then comes across the room, lowering himself 
               tentatively to the couch.

                                     HENRY
                         Is she alright?

               She says nothing for a moment, then...

                                     PEARL
                              (sadly)
                         Do you think I'm pretty?

               Henry lifts his hand and covers his face. He looks up at the 
               ceiling and sighs. He returns to Pearl...

                                     HENRY
                         Does she need help?

               Pearl reaches over and grabs his thigh. Looking up at him, 
               with tears rolling down her face, she suggests...

                                     PEARL
                         I'll suck your cock if you kill him 
                         for me.

               Henry jumps away from her and Pearl throws herself down on 
               the couch, covering her face.

               INT. VICKY'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

               Moments later.

               Henry barges in and starts searching for...

                                     HENRY
                         Vicky! Vicky, it's Henry from across 
                         the street! Vicky!

               He runs through the house, checking the rooms. He throws 
               open the door to the bedroom and finds...

               Vicky, sitting on the edge of the bed, smoking. She has a 
               black eye and a swollen cheek.

                                     HENRY
                              (taken back)
                         Vicky?

                                     VICKY
                              (standing)
                         What do you think you're doing, you 
                         idiot!

                                     WARREN
                              (off)
                         Hey!

               Henry looks over and sees Warren stumble drunkenly out of 
               the bathroom. What are you doing in my house?

                                     HENRY
                              (to Vicky)
                         It's about Pearl.

               Vicky looks troubled. She sits back down with a sigh.

                                     VICKY
                         Mind your own business, Henry.

                                     WARREN
                              (shoves him)
                         Yeah, who the hell do you think you 
                         are, anyway?

               Henry falls back and looks at Vicky. She looks away.

               Henry looks at Warren, pauses, then gives him a sharp, hard 
               shove.

               Warren stands back against the wall, pauses, then erupts 
               into viciousness.

               He grabs Henry and throws him violently down the hall, where 
               he hits the wall and collapses.

               As Henry gets to his knees, Warren kicks him in the ribs. 
               Henry curls up and rolls out on to the kitchen floor. Warren 
               kicks him in the side of the head.

               Vicky sits back down on the bed, covering her ears.

               Warren beats the hell out of Henry, kicking him in the face 
               and ribs whenever he manages to get up on his hands and knees. 
               Henry crawls under the kitchen table for safety. Warren grabs 
               his feet and drags him out. As he is dragged across the floor, 
               Henry finds a screwdriver and grabs it. He rolls over on his 
               back as...

               Warren lunges down at him again and...

                                     WARREN
                         Ah.

               Warren is stabbed in the heart.

               Henry can't believe it.

               Warren can't believe it. He stands there in the middle of 
               the kitchen, amazed, with the screwdriver sticking out of 
               his chest.

               Henry, semi-conscious and severely beaten, falls against the 
               back door and coughs up a few of his teeth. Vicky steps into 
               the hall from her room and shudders.

               Warren sits at the table, stunned. He looks from the 
               screwdriver to Vicky, then...

                                     WARREN
                         Fuck.

               He falls to the floor.

               EXT. STREETS -- NIGHT

               Henry staggers away, limping. He comes to the intersection 
               at the end of the block and doesn't know which way to run. 
               Panicked, he looks round, holding his arm to his chest. He 
               runs towards the highway.

               INT. POLICE STATION -- NIGHT

               Later.

               Fay is wired beyond belief. Trying to listen attentively, 
               but still too overwhelmed to maintain her concentration.

                                     LAWYER
                              (off)
                         It is true your husband served seven 
                         years in prison for statutory rape.

                                     FAY
                         Yes. It is.

                                     LAWYER
                         And when was that?

                                     FAY
                         That was... I dunno. Fifteen... 
                         Sixteen years ago.

                                     LAWYER
                         And when were you married?

                                     FAY
                         We were married seven years ago.

                                     LAWYER
                         Were you aware at all of the victim's 
                         relationship with his daughter?

                                     FAY
                         Pardon me?

                                     LAWYER
                         The girl, the daughter, Pearl. She 
                         had been having sexual relations 
                         with her father.

               Fay is overwhelmed.

                                     FAY
                         I didn't know that. No.

                                     LAWYER
                         Pearl claims she offered your husband 
                         sexual favors if he would kill her 
                         father.

               Fay just looks at him blankly, overwhelmed, confused. She 
               starts to cry quietly.

                                     LAWYER
                         I'm just repeating what she said, 
                         Mrs Fool. The victim's wife, Vicky, 
                         claims your husband broke into the 
                         house and forcefully entered her 
                         bedroom.

               Fay trembles and catches her breath trying to take this all 
               in. A cop hands her some tissues. She takes them and tries 
               to concentrate on what the lawyer says.

                                     LAWYER
                         Fay, I know this isn't easy. But we 
                         need your help here. The girl claims 
                         she asked your husband to kill her 
                         father in exchange for, well, I guess 
                         the promise of sexual relations with 
                         her.

               INT. POLICE STATION CORRIDOR -- NIGHT

               Later.

               Fay staggers out into the noisy corridor and rests against 
               the wall. Looking down the hall she sees...

               Pearl and Vicky, sitting in a blank, brightly lit room beyond 
               a glass door.

               Fay comes closer and looks in at them.

               They don't see her. They stare at the floor before them, 
               dazed and confused.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Morning.

               Fay is lying on her bed with her coat still on, trying to 
               think. Ned stands by the side of the bed, watching her.

                                     NED
                         Mom?

                                     FAY
                         Yeah.

                                     NED
                         Where's Dad?

                                     FAY
                         I don't know, honey. Leave me alone 
                         a minute, I gotta think.

               He picks at the bedspread and looks at the ceiling, then...

                                     NED
                         Mom?

                                     FAY
                         What!

                                     NED
                         Is Dad in trouble?

                                     FAY
                         Yes, Ned, he is. He's in big trouble. 
                         Now just be quiet for two minutes.

               He walks around to the other side of the bed and waits a 
               moment before...

                                     NED
                         Mom?

                                     FAY
                         I'm warning you, Ned.

                                     NED
                         Mom, can I be a mailman when I grow 
                         up?

               Fay sits up, pauses and studies her son.

                                     FAY
                         Sure you can, honey. You can be 
                         anything you want.

               Ned is happy to hear this. He shuffles out of the room and 
               Fay falls back on the bed.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Ned comes into the kitchen and digs through the drawers 
               beneath the sink. He finds an envelope. He reads the return 
               address: Chelsea Hotel, New York City.

               EXT. SUBWAY -- DAY

               Ned approaches the subway station and climbs the stairs to 
               the platform.

               EXT. SUBWAY PLATFORM -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Ned runs up the stairs to the elevated platform just as a 
               train pulls into the station. He runs down a few cars and 
               hops in as the doors slide open.

               INT. TRAIN -- DAY

               Ned rides the train to New York City.

               EXT. SUBWAY STOP -- DAY

               Twenty minutes later.

               He comes up out of the subway on to the street, looks around.

               INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- DAY

               He comes into the hotel and rings an annoying buzzer which 
               brings out the concierge, who is in his little office, 
               watching TV.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         Yeah, what do you want?

                                     NED
                         My uncle.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         What's his name?

                                     NED
                         Simon Grim.

               The concierge looks through his book as Ned waits.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         There ain't no one here by that name.

               Ned pulls the envelope from his pocket, unfolds it and shows 
               it to the concierge.

                                     NED
                         Room 423.

               The concierge studies the envelope and hands it back.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         This is post marked five years ago.

               Disappointed, Ned takes back the envelope and stands looking 
               at his sneakers.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         What does he look like?

                                     NED
                              (hopeless)
                         I don't know.

                                     CONCIERGE
                         Sorry, kid. Can't help ya.

               Ned steps away from the front desk and moves towards the 
               door. But then he stops and looks back at...

               The concierge, sitting back in his office, returning his 
               attention to the TV set.

               The boy heads for the elevator.

               The concierge looks up and sees him.

                                     CONCIERGE
                              (jumping up)
                         Hey!

               Ned checks his step and runs for the service stairs.

               The concierge goes after him.

               INT. HOTEL STAIRCASE -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Ned runs up the stairs, the concierge in pursuit.

               INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Ned jumps out into the hall, narrowly escaping the clutches 
               of the concierge, who falls to the floor.

               Ned runs up the hall, checking the room numbers as the 
               concierge gets to his feet. He finds...

               Room 423.

               He knocks.

               The concierge strides up the hall towards him.

               Ned knocks again.

               The concierge bears down upon him.

               He knocks again and...

               The door opens a crack, held by its safety chain. A female 
               figure in silhouette is at the narrow gap.

               Ned looks from the door to the concierge approaching.

               The concierge arrives and reaches out for him, but the door 
               opens wide and Ned dives in.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM 423 -- DAY

               Same time.

               The concierge stands in the hallway. The door swings shut in 
               his face.

               Ned kneels on the floor of the hotel room, waiting to be 
               smacked, or something.

               But when nothing happens, he opens his eyes and looks back 
               over his shoulder at...

               Laura, the secretary from the publishing house. She is dressed 
               for travel and has her coat hung over her arm, a suitcase in 
               her hand. She smiles at him, then looks from the boy to 
               someone across the room and...

               Ned follows her gaze to find...

               Simon, standing there before him, a suitcase in his hand as 
               well. He looks down at Ned with a calm, intrigued expression.

               The boy looks up at him in awe.

               Simon steps forward, pauses, then...

                                     SIMON
                         Get up off your knees.

               He does.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               A taxi pulls up. Simon and Ned climb out and Laura leans out 
               of the window.

                                     LAURA
                         Promise me you'll be on that plane 
                         at seven, Simon.

                                     SIMON
                         I'll see you in Stockholm.

               They kiss. The taxi pulls away. Simon comes down beside Ned, 
               takes the boy by the shoulders and whispers in his ear.

               The kid takes off.

               Simon looks over at World of Donuts and sees Gnoc waiting 
               there at the door.

               EXT. BEHIND WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY

               Gnoc leads Simon out through the kitchen. A band is seen 
               doing a sound check, inside.

               Buñuel and Hawkes are waiting there, looking concerned.

               Simon gives Buñuel his passport.

               Buñuel nods and leaves.

               Hawkes and Gnoc open the cellar doors.

               INT. WORLD OF DONUTS BASEMENT -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Simon is lead down the stairs and stops. He looks on in horror 
               at...

               Henry, lying on a makeshift bed, badly beaten up and weak. 
               Mr Deng is wrapping his chest in bandages.

               Simon pauses, then comes closer. He reaches out and touches 
               Henry's shoulder, standing there looking down at his friend. 
               Henry looks up at him, pauses and then gestures vaguely with 
               his hand.

                                     HENRY
                         Look, Simon, the world's a scary 
                         place. I admit it. But it's not my 
                         fault. I swear!

               Simon thinks about this and looks away.

                                     SIMON
                         I'm sorry, Henry.

                                     HENRY
                         Don't be. You had things to do.

                                     SIMON
                         So did you.

               Henry thinks about that, sighs and looks away.

               INT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Fay packs up the many books of the 'Confession' into one of 
               the old suitcases Henry first came to town with. She slams 
               it shut.

               EXT. THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY

               Ned runs along the street and stops at the police car. He 
               points down the street with great urgency. The cops jump in 
               their cars and take off. He then looks over at...

               Fay, leaving the house with Henry's suitcase.

               EXT. WORLD OF DONUTS BACK ALLEY -- DAY

               Same time.

               Buñuel backs his car into the alley behind World of Donuts. 
               Stepping out of the car he hands Simon back the passport.

               Simon checks it and then looks up to see...

               Father Hawkes and Mr Deng helping Henry outside. Coming out 
               into the daylight, he straightens up and manages to walk on 
               his own. He motions Ned over and leans down to the kid with 
               difficulty.

                                     HENRY
                         Gotta light?

               Ned does. He has his own Zippo lighter and he proudly lights 
               his dad's cigarette.

               Henry smokes, hugs Ned, then leans back and pauses. Finally...

                                     HENRY
                         Take care of your mom and don't start 
                         trouble you can't finish.

               Ned nods and Henry pats him on the shoulder. Then he stands 
               before Fay and looks at his feet. With her arms folded across 
               her chest and her hip cocked, she taps her foot impatiently 
               and waits for his last line of crap.

                                     HENRY
                         I love you, Fay.

                                     FAY
                              (rolls her eyes)
                         Yeah, well, tough.

               But then she looks at him and softens. He leans in and kisses 
               her passionately on the mouth.

               Moments later, they all help Henry into Buñuel's car and 
               Simon gets in behind the wheel. The doors slam shut and Simon 
               steers the car slowly up the alley. Henry gazes out at Fay 
               running along beside the car with the rest of the 
               neighborhood, some of them laughing, some of them crying...

               EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL -- DAY

               Simon pulls up at the curb and jumps out. He helps Henry 
               climb out and together they enter the terminal.

               INT. AIRLINE TICKET COUNTER -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Henry steps up.

                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK
                         Passport and ticket, please.

               Henry hands them over. He glances back at...

               Simon, waiting.

               The clerk compares Henry to the picture in the passport, 
               checks again, then...

                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK
                              (recognizes)
                         It's an honor to meet you, Mr Grim. 
                         Really. I mean, God. Congratulations 
                         on the Nobel Prize.

                                     HENRY
                         Thanks.

                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK
                         I know all your work by heart. It 
                         changed my life.

                                     HENRY
                         Yeah, well. Look, thanks, but..

                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK
                         Yes. Of course.

               She types something more into the computer, then looks up 
               urgently.

                                     AIRLINE TICKET CLERK
                         You'll have to hurry, sir. They're 
                         holding the plane for you on the 
                         runway.

               INT. AIRPORT GATE -- DAY

               Moments later.

               Airline representatives come rushing up with walkie-talkies 
               to meet Henry and Simon as they run through the terminal.

                                     AIRLINE REP #1
                         This way, please, this way! This 
                         way, Mr Grim! This way! Excuse me!

               As they are ushered up towards the gate, Henry stops and 
               looks off at the security guards and ground crew waiting for 
               him, certain they can spot him as a wanted criminal.

                                     SIMON
                              (shoves him)
                         Go on.

               Henry is ushered through security. They take his ticket and 
               check his passport again. They take his suitcase and place 
               it on the conveyor belt. He passes through the metal detector. 
               They pass the metal detector wand over him and he stands 
               there with his hands outstretched, as...

               Simon waits and watches.

               The suitcase rolls out from the x-ray machine and as Henry 
               grabs it, he stops and looks across the security checkpoint 
               at...

               Simon, standing there. He steps forward anxiously.

               Henry lingers, speechless, but the airline representatives 
               are at his side...

                                     AIRLINE REP
                         Mr Grim, please, the plane is waiting! 
                         We have to hurry!

               They drag him away, but Henry looks back as...

               Simon stops and watches.

               EXT. AIRPORT RUNWAY -- DAY

               Moments later.

               The plane is waiting out on the asphalt and the airline 
               representative runs straight for it, calling back over her 
               shoulder to Henry...

                                     AIRLINE REP
                         This way, Mr Grim! This way!

               Runway technicians rush to their positions, but Henry hangs 
               back and struggles across the tarmac, looking back over his 
               shoulder at...

               Simon, behind the huge plate glass window of the terminal.

               He stops and waits.

               Simon raises his hand in farewell and...

               Henry raises his in reply.

               Then Simon, unheard behind the gigantic glass wall, silent 
               amongst the roar of the runway, says...

                                     SIMON
                              (unheard)
                         Run.

               And Henry understands. He lowers his hand, waits just a 
               moment, then turns and looks out at...

               The airplane. The airline representative is shouting at him 
               from the foot of the stairs and waving him on with her walkie-
               talkie.

               He glances back once more at Simon. Then...

               Henry is running, struggling towards us, forcing himself 
               towards the plane, getting stronger and running faster with 
               every step he takes.

                                                               CUT TO BLACK

    OVER DARKNESS...                                                  1

    ...we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE
    GUIDE.
                 GUIDE VOICE
         It is an important and popular fact that
         things are not always what they seem.

    A small square image appears on screen.    Home video.      The
    dolphin stadium at Sea World.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         For instance, on the planet Earth, man had
         always assumed that he was the most
         intelligent species occupying the planet,
         instead of the third most intelligent
         which was, in fact, entirely accurate.

    The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc.

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The second most intelligent creatures
         were, of course, dolphins who curiously
         enough had long known of the impending
         destruction of the planet Earth. They had
         made many attempts to alert mankind to the
         danger, but most of their communications
         were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to
         punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so
         they eventually decided they would leave
         Earth by their own means.

    They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher...

                 GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
         The last ever dolphin message was
         misinterpreted as a surprisingly
         sophisticated attempt to do a double-
         backward somersault through a hoop while
         whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but
         in fact the message was this...
         "So long and thanks for all the fish."

    TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES)

    Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles.
    Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a
    Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR
    ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the
    dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never
    come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the
    dolphins have vanished.

    END TITLES

    As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then...

                         VOICE ON RADIO
                 ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San
                 Diego reporting their dolphins have
                 mysteriously disappeared overnight.

    INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING                        2

    CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates.
    A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind
    faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands
    and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room.

3   IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3
    He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER
    through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA
    KETTLE WHISTLES O.S.

4   INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                     4

    Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS
    VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice
    through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS.

    He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his
    mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO
    ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia)
    at a costume party.

    He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold
    compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The
    tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he
    sees the bulldozers.

    The tea cup shatters on the floor.
                                                     CUT TO:
5   EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING                          5

    Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in
    front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his
    house. He yells into his mobile phone.

                       ARTHUR
                  (into phone)
              What do you mean he's gone out to lunch?
              You just said he was still at breakfast!

    MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him.

                      PROSSER
              Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in
              front of the bulldozers forever.

                      ARTHUR
              I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.

                      PROSSER
              This bypass has got to be built and it's
              going to be built. You should have made
              your protest months ago.

                      ARTHUR
              The first I heard of it was when a workman
              came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to
              clean the windows, and he said he'd come
              to demolish the house. He didn't tell me
              right away of course. First he wiped a
              couple of windows and charged me twenty
              quid. Then he told me.
                                                (CONTINUED)

    The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the
    steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase.

                         PROSSER
                 Look. These plans have been on display at
                 the planning office now for a year.

                         ARTHUR
                 On display? I had to go down to a cellar!

                         PROSSER
                 That's the display department.

                         ARTHUR
                 I eventually found them in the bottom of a
                 locked filing cabinet in a disused
                 lavatory with a sign on the door saying
                 'beware of the leopard'.

                         PROSSER
                 Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much
                 damage that bulldozer would suffer if I
                 just let it roll straight over you?

                         ARTHUR
                 How much?

                         PROSSER
                 None at all.

                         FORD (O.S.)
                   (American accent)
                 Arthur!

    Arthur and Prosser turn to see a man cresting a hill,
    pushing a shopping cart which is filled with beer and
    bags of peanuts. This is FORD PREFECT. Wiry, intense.
    As he heads downhill, he leaps up and rides the cart down
    towards Arthur's house -- like a kid in a supermarket.
    He rolls right past Arthur and the bulldozers.

                         ARTHUR
                 Ford?

    He leaps off, drags the cart to a full stop.

                         FORD
                 Arthur! There you are. Here drink and
                 eat with me. We need to talk.

                         ARTHUR
                 Er, um...now's not the best time, Ford
                 They're going to demolish my home,

                          FORD
                 Whoa.   You already know? How?

    Arthur simply motions to the bulldozer.

               Oh. When you say "they" you mean they.
               Got it. Listen, I gotta tell you
               something important, and I gotta tell you
               now.

                       ARTHUR
               But what about my house?

    Ford looks to Prosser who is conferring with the
    bulldozer driver. He pushes the cart over to him.

    ARTHUR - watches as Ford gestures to Prosser who waves
    his hand and the all the 'dozer engines die.
    The bulldozer drivers step down, start drinking the beer
    and eating the peanuts. Ford returns to Arthur.

                      FORD
              C'mon. Let's go to the pub. He said they
              won't destroy your house until they've
              finished the beers.

                      ARTHUR
              Can we trust him?

                       FORD
               I'd trust him to the end of the Earth.

                      ARTHUR
              And how far's that?

                      FORD
              About twelve minutes away.

6   INT. VILLAGE PUB - MIDDAY                                             6

    Ford and Arthur enter the half-full pub. Ford hurries to
    the bar. Arthur follows, cell phone to his ear.

                      FORD
              Six pints of bitter. And quickly.      The
              world's about to end.

                       BARMAN
               Oh yes, sir? Nice weather for it.

    He starts to pull pints. Ford shoves bar peanuts into
    his pockets while Arthur shouts into his phone...

                      ARTHUR
              Well, when does he get back from lunch?
              Or is he going straight out for tea?!

    He shuts the phone, sits, looking forlorn.

                      ARTHUR (CONT'D)
              This is shaping up to be a crap day.

                         FORD
                 It's about to get a lot crappier.

                         BARMAN
                 There you are, six pints.

    Ford slaps down a £50 note. The barman's impressed.

                         FORD
                 Keep the change. You've got ten minutes to
                 spend it.

    Ford pushes three pints in front of Arthur.

                         ARTHUR
                 Three? At lunchtime?

                         FORD
                 Time is an illusion. Lunchtime doubly so.

                         ARTHUR
                 Very deep. You should send that in to the
                 Reader's Digest. They've got a page for
                 people like you.

                         FORD
                 Drink up.

                         ARTHUR
                 Why three pints?

                         FORD
                 Muscle relaxant.
                    (grabbing more peanuts)
                 And eat these. You'll need the salt.

                         ARTHUR
                 What's going on. Ford?

                         FORD
                 What would you say if I told you I wasn't
                 really from Guilford but from a small
                 planet somewhere in the vicinity of
                 Eetelgeuse?

                         ARTHUR
                 Why, is it the sort of thing you're likely
                 to say?

                         FORD
                 Remember when we met? That car was racing
                 toward me, I was trying to greet it, you
                 pushed me out of the way?

         QUICK CUT TO A STREET - MID-DAY                                  7

         Ford stands in the middle of the road, extending a hand
         to a fast approaching car.
         Arthur drops his shopping, dives at him and tackles him
         out of the way as the car zooms past.

                           FORD
                   Didn't you find it a little strange that I
                   was trying to shake hands with a car?

                           ARTHUR
                   I assumed you were drunk.

                           FORD
                      (shaking his head)
                   I thought cars were the dominant life
                   form. I was trying to introduce myself.

                           ARTHUR
                   And that's why you're named after a
                   discontinued car from the seventies?

                           FORD
                      (nodding)
                   You saved my life that day.      Now I'm
                   saving yours.

         Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer.

                           ARTHUR
                   This must be Thursday. I never could get
                   the hang of Thursdays.

                           FORD
                   Look, if it's about your house...

                   No, it's not that.    It's....

         He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone.

                           ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                   I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I
                   found her, and then I let her get away.
                   You remember that fancy dress party I told
                   you about?

                           FORD
                   This isn't a long story, is it? We've
                   only got six minutes.

         Arthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch.

              Okay.     Talk and drink. Fancy dress party.

                      ARTHUR
              At that flat in Islington. I told you
              about it. Last week, remember?

8   INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT                                     8

    Crowded flat.    Everyone is in costume.   Loud music BLARES.

                       ARTHUR (V.O.)
               I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't
               want to go, would have much rather stayed
               home and, I don't know, brush the dog.
               Anything. But there I was -- and then,
               there she was...

    Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet,
    sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable.

                       TRICIA (O.S.)
               Who are you?

    Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid
    19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is
    holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks
    beautiful.   Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands.

                       ARTHUR
               I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent.

                       TRICIA
               No, I mean who are you?

                       ARTHUR
               Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um...
                  (sheepishly tipping his hat)
               Livingston, I presume.
                   (pointing to her attire)
               Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the
               best I could do on short notice.

                       TRICIA
               You're the first person who's got it
               right. Everyone keeps calling me
               Sherlock.

                      ARTHUR
              Really? I thought the beagle made it
              rather obvious.

    THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of

    image and laugh.

                 She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and
                 beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five
                 degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics,

                 I've got so many degrees I am officially
                 unemployable. Let's drink to that!

    They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat.

                 And just as I was asking myself, "Why is

                 giving me the time of day, out of nowhere
                 she says...

                         ARTHUR
                 Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a
                 lovely little cafe around the corner...

                         TRICIA
                 I was thinking Madagascar.

                 Is that a new club on Dean Street?

                         TRICIA
                 No. It's a country.    Off the coast of

                          ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                  Well...that's...an extraordinary
                  proposition. But...I can't just up and
                  go. What about my job?

                           TRICIA
                  Quit.   Get a new one when we return.

                  I can't just...what about my house?     Who
                  would feed my dog?

                          TRICIA
                  Bring him with.

                          ARTHUR
                  He's a Welsh Collie.   He'd feel all out of
                  place in Madagascar.

     Trillian forces a smile, clearly disappointed.

                  You don't want to go to Madagascar.

     They both turn to face ZAPHOD BEEBLEBROX - very charming,

                  Hi. I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, President of
                  the Galaxy -- of course, you probably
                  already know that. I'm headed for a lost
                  and distant planet. Would you like to see
                  my spaceship?

                          ARTHUR (V.O.)
                  I went to refresh our drinks.     When I came
                  back, she was gone.

     Arthur stares into his beer, plagued by this loss.

                          ARTHUR
                  "Would you like to see my spaceship?"
                  Really, what sort of chat up line is that?

                          FORD
                  More popular than you'd think.

                          ARTHUR
                  I've left messages, sent letters... It's
                  like she's vanished off the face of the
                  earth.

                   We've got two minutes. So drink up.

      There's a ROAR OF ENGINES and a LOUD CRASH outside.
      Arthur and everyone else in the pub look up.

                           ARTHUR
                   My house!

      He runs out. Ford rises, grabs two handfuls of peanuts from
      the bowl, tosses the barman all the money in his pocket.

                           FORD
                   A round for everyone, on me.

                           BARMAN
                   You really think the world's going to end?
                      (Ford nods)
                   Shouldn't we lie down or put a bag over
                   our heads or something?

                           FORD
                   Not really.

      He gives everyone in the bar a friendly salute, exits.

      Arthur runs up the road towards his house which is being
      bulldozed. Ford strides casually behind in the distance.

                            ARTHUR
                   STOP!   STOP, YOU BASTARDS!!

      Arthur suddenly stops running and covers his ears as we
      hear THE LOUDEST RUMBLE IN MOTION PICTURE HISTORY.

11a   A GIGANTIC YELLOW SPACESHIP (picture a concrete tower         11a
      block)) sweeps overhead. Ford hits the deck. Arthur is
      blown sideways. Trees are uprooted.

      Ford rises and hurries to the rubble that was Arthur's
      house. He digs around near the exposed toilet and comes
      up with -- A TOWEL. He hurries to Arthur's side.

                      Here.   You'll need this.

         He tosses Arthur the towel. Then, he removes a short
         black rod, his ELECTRONIC THUMB. He sticks it out.

        Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few
        small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses

        The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving
        nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS.

21      Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we       21
        see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY."

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a
                     wholly remarkable book...

        The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an
        electronic book with lots of buttons.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly
                     the most successful book ever to come out
                     of the great publishing corporations of
                     Ursa Minor.

        The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A
        star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations...

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE
                     OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE

                     controversial than Oolon Colluphid's

                     WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S
                     GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD
                     PERSON, ANYWAY?

        Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as
        the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     In many of the more relaxed civilizations
                     on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy,
                     the Hitchhiker's Guide has already
                     supplanted the great Encyclopedia
                     Galactica as the standard repository of
                     all knowledge and wisdom. For though it
                     has many omissions, and contains much
                     which is apocryphal, or at least wildly
                     inaccurate, it scores over the older, more
                     pedestrian work in two important respects.
                     First, it is slightly cheaper. And second,
                     it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in
                     large friendly letters on its cover.

        The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just
        below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee.

        PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the
        blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.

                     So you're not from Guilford, which would
                     explain the accent -- which I've always
                     wondered about...and you're not an out of

                     this...this...book thing.

        Ford nods.    Arthur rubs his weary brow.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     I don't feel well. I need a cup of tea.

                     And do a reassuring little laugh.

                   Good god. Is this really the interior of a

        Jeltz consults one screen after another. At last he sees
        Ford and Arthur. His walrusy eyes narrow.

                   Blown up? BLOWN UP?! Couldn't you have
                   done something?!!

                             FORD
                     And all those ants.

                             ARTHUR
                     Yes, but ants aren't exactly people!

                             FORD
                     And now you're thinking like a Vogon.
                        (before Arthur can respond)
                     I saved your life, okay? Which makes us
                     even. Next thing.

        Ford throws Arthur a towel. Arthur looks confused.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      It's a tough galaxy. You want to survive
                      out here, you really gotta know where your
                      towel is. Now gimme a hand over here.

        Arthur joins Ford near a rusty ventilation pipe.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      Careful, it's hot.

        He slides the towel behind the pipe, holding each end of
        it, Arthur does the same.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      We've got to get off this ship before the
                      Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers.
                      Which is why they make ships with walls
                      that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to
                      pass through. So we've got to send the
                      signal up and out if we wanna catch a
                      ride. Pull.

        They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam
        shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe.

                             ARTHUR
                     What's a Vogon?

                             FORD
                     Ask the guide.    Say "Vogons."

        Ford continues turning dials.        Arthur lifts the Guide.

                             ARTHUR
                     "Vogons."

        The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision.

                  Vogons are one of the most unpleasant
                  races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad-
                  tempered, bureaucratic, officious and
                  callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger
                  to save their own grandmothers from the
                  Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without

                  The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon
                  is to stick your finger down his throat.

                  They can't think, they can't imagine, most
                  of them can't even spell. They just run
                  things.

                  They've destroyed a planet today, that
                  always makes them a little feisty.

                  That's it? That's all this idiotic book

                  Mostly harmless.

        Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with
        screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears.

        Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He
        moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles.

                  WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH...

        The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to

        As he succeeds, the noise mutates to the Vogon Captain's
        voice. Arthur looks incredulous.

                  This is your captain speaking, so stop

        The struggle continues. As they're dragged out the door,

                  It feeds on brainwave energy, absorbing
                  unconscious frequencies and excreting
                  a matrix of conscious frequencies to the
                  speech centres of the brain, the practical
                  upshot of which is that if you stick one in
                  your ear, you instantly understand anything
                  said to you in any language.

        Arthur continues to struggle, until he passes a portal
        window. He backs up to look out.

                          GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                  Now, it is such a bizarrely improbable
                  thing that anything so mind-bogglingly
                  useful could have evolved in the Universe
                  purely by chance that many thinkers have
                  chosen to see this as a final clinching

27       INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        27

         Arthur and Ford are strapped against two concrete pillars
         with hundreds of elastic bands.

         A STRANGE AND LETHAL LOOKING DEVICE DESCENDS FROM THE
         CEILING. Looks like an instrument of torture. As the
         device descends, Jeltz fishes a JEWELED CRAB out of a
         gunky trough and smashes it with a hammer -- BLAM!

         Jeltz takes the device in his hand -- then blows in it.
         We hear FEEDBACK. It's a microphone (like ones used to
         introduce boxers). He taps it. This thing on? It is.
         He faces them, holds up a book entitled... "       " --
         smirks, then begins to read Vogon poetry.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     Vogon poetry is widely accepted as the
                     third worst in the universe.

        Ford VIBRATES like he's having an epileptic seizure.
        Arthur just looks like he has a migraine.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     The second worst is that of the Azgoths of
                     Kria. During a recitation by their Poet
                     Master Grunthos the Flatulent of his poem
                     "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found
                     in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning," four
                     of his audience died of internal
                     hemorrhaging, and the President of the Mid-
                     Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived by
                     gnawing one of his own legs off.

        Spasms wrack Ford's body.    He SCREAMS.     Arthur squints.

                             JELTZ
                     Or I shall rend thee In the gobberwarts
                     with my blurglecruncheaon, see if I don't!

        Ford's entire body tenses, arches, then goes limp.
        Arthur lets out an audible sigh as the poem ends.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The absolute worst poetry was written by
                     Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Sussix.
                     It involved decaying swans. Luckily, it
                     was destroyed when the Earth was.

                                         JELTZ
                     So, Earthlings, I present you with a
                     simple choice. Either die in the vacuum
                     of space, or -- tell what you thought of
                     my poem.

        Ford is spent, can't say a word. Arthur looks up.

                             ARTHUR
                     Actually...I rather liked it.

        Jeltz looks surprised. Ford notices, whispers to Arthur.

                             FORD
                     Good tact. Run with it.

                             ARTHUR
                     Um...some of the words I didn't understand,
                     but I found the imagery quite effective.

                  seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of
                  the underlying metaphor of the humanity...

                          FORD
                  Vogonity!

                  ... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's
                  soul, which contrives through the medium
                  of the verse structure to sublimate, er...

        Jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly.

                             FORD
                  Damn.

                             ARTHUR
                  What?

                          FORD
                  I think you just saved my life again.

                          JELTZ
                  An astute analysis. Very impressive.
                     (turning to the Guard)
                  Throw them off the ship.

        The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge.

                          VOGON GUARD
                  Resistance is useless!

                           JELTZ

        Jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab.

                   So this is it? We're going to die?

        Arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself.

                             ARTHUR
                     You know, it's at times like this, when
                     I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man
                     from Betelgeuse and about to die of
                     asphyxiation in deep space that I really
                     wish I'd listened to what my mother told

                             FORD
                     Why? What did you she tell you?

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't know. I didn't listen.

        Ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up
        toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help?

                             FORD
                     You're sweating.

        Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the
        airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look
        to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then --
        PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out.

30      EXT. DEEP SPACE -- CONTINUOUS                                   30

        Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their
        breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     "Space..." says the introduction to the
                     Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big.
                     You just won't believe how vastly, hugely
                     mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you
                     may think it's a long way down the road to
                     the market, but that's just peanuts
                     compared to space..." and so on.

        The weightless guide twirls away.    Arthur reaches for it.
        The words "DON'T PANIC" alight.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     It also says that if you hold a lung full
                     of air you can survive in the total vacuum
                     of space for about thirty seconds -- but
                     with space being really big and all, the

        Something else falls out of his pocket -- his digital

                     dress party and met a very nice girl whom
                     he totally failed to connect with.

        He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips.
        His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away.

30a     Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny        30a
        hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party
        balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside
        out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a
        stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

        In the middle of this hi-tech receiving bay sit two

        TRILLIAN turns -- and we now recognize her as Tricia from

        red. She looks amazing.

        His head jerks upwards. He quickly grabs it with his
        hands and shoves it back down.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  I didn't pick them up. The ship did.

                  I didn't engage the drive.

                          TRILLIAN
                  We picked them up in sector ZZ9 Plural Z
                  Alpha -- where you picked me up.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's impossible.

                            TRILLIAN
                  No.    Just very, very improbable.

                  I don't have time for this! We've got the

                  stop to pick up hitchhikers?! Okay, so
                  ten out of ten for style, but minus
                  several million for good thinking, eh?

        He reaches for a hi-tech gun on the wall.      She stops him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  Don't. I'll send Marvin. (calling)
                  Marvin!

        Zaphod rolls his eyes as a humanoid robot rises from its
        seat behind them. This is MARVIN. He trudges slump-
        shouldered toward Zaphod.

                          MARVIN
                  I think you ought to know I'm feeling very
                  depressed.

                          TRILLIAN
                  We have something to take your mind off
                  things.

                  It won't work, I have an exceptionally
                  large mind.

                          TRILLIAN
                  I know. Go down to the number two entry
                  bay and bring the two aliens up here.

                          MARVIN
                  Just that?

                          TRILLIAN
                  Yes.

                          MARVIN
                  I won't enjoy it.

                          ZAPHOD
                  She's not asking you to enjoy it. Just do
                  it will you?

                          MARVIN
                  All right. I'll do it.

        Marvin turns and trudges away. Then he turns again.

                          MARVIN (CONT'D)
                  I'm not getting you down at all am I?

                          TRILLIAN
                  No, no, Marvin, it's fine really. It's just
                  part of life.

                           MARVIN
                  Life.   Don't talk to me about life.

        Marvin trudges away. A door slides open for him and
        makes an audible, satisfied SIGH as it does.

        A light blinks on a console. A VOGON CAPTAIN turns a
        dial, listens through his head set. He punches a few
        buttons. COMMANDER KWALTZ (green and walrusy like Jeltz)
        appears on the large monitor, sitting in his chair at
        Command Headquarters.

                     Get me the vice-president.

        Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring
        sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers.
        Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the
        next. He hands them back to the messengers (who has been
        jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The

        Arthur looks around and notices the room is gleaming
        white, hi-tech, brand new, plastic still on some stuff.

                              ARTHUR
                     Now this is more like my idea of a

                     This way.

        He pushes a button. The door slides open with a satisfied
        sigh -- "Hhhmmyaaaahhh". As they walk through...

        They whip around to find Marvin standing before them.

                      'cause I don't.

         Marvin turns and walks away. They shrug to each other and

         HANGING ON THE WALL is the official presidential portrait,
         featuring Zaphod who sports a very smart suit and a fake
         politicians smile. Tilt down to the door which opens -
         "Mmyyahhh!" - to reveal Ford, Arthur and Marvin.

         Zaphod spins around in his chair, holding a gun but
         sporting that same politically correct smile.

                    Freeze!

         Arthur and Ford throw their hands up.      Marvin doesn't.

                    Do you mean sit in a corner and rust or

                   I know. And it was rude to just leave,
                   but I told you I wanted to get away, and
                   he had a spaceship parked outside, well,
                   honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of
                   stay-at-home-and-read-a book type.
                      (hopeful)
                   But you're here...

        Arthur smiles, then realizes with some regret...

                           ARTHUR
                   Actually -- I am that type. But...well
                   you do know what happened, don't you?

        Zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur.

                           ZAPHOD
                   --Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride,
                   and here we all are. Now, enough small
                   talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember?
                   I stole a ship?

                           ARTHUR
                   We're having a bit of a chat if you don't
                   mind.

        Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly,
        Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots
        all the up way revealing a second head that lives
        somewhere under his chin.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                    You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up
                    or I'll kick you in the gones!

                            FORD
                    There's the Zaphod I remember.

        Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists.

        Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out
        of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur
        buckles and hits the floor.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                    You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford.
                    He's a guest on my ship.

                            FORD
                    I thought you said you stole it.

         A KLAXON sounds. Red lights FLASH. Zaphod (Head 2)
         hurries to the console. Ford follows.

         Trillian hurries to Arthur who nurses his jaw.

                       that isn't even your name.

                       A little help over here?

         Trillian leaves Arthur, joins Zaphod

                               ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                       They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a

        An IMAGE APPEARS on the ship's monitor - Vice President,
        QUESTULAR RONTOK, flanked by Vogon Commander KWALTZ {at
        H.Q.). He looks reluctant. He has to say this...

                          QUESTULAR (ON MONITOR)
                  This is Vice President Questular Rontok.
                  I am speaking to the kidnapper of the
                  President. Surrender your stolen vessel at
                  once or we will take action as defined and
                  permitted by Section 1.8 of the Galactic
                  Interstellar Space Bi-Laws.

                  Sure thing, fella, but I should tell you
                  we need proper authorization before
                  entering a hyperspace expressway.

                          ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                  Or else what? They'll send a hundred and
                  one ships? DO it!

        He and Trillian buckle up. Ford turns to Arthur.

                          FORD
                  Brace yourself.   This is a bit like being
                  drunk.

                          ARTHUR

                     You do realize he did what he did because
                     he knew this is what you would do.

                            KWALTZ
                     Rules are rules, Mr. Vice President.     And
                     they are made to be followed.

        Questular looks up to the screen at all the Vogon ships.

                            QUESTULAR
                     Don't you think this many ships is a bit,
                     oh I don't know -- excessive?

                            KWALTZ
                     The provisions are clear. Under
                     subsection 37a these are the forces we
                     deploy to protect the president in the
                     case of an attempted or actual kidnapping-

        He holds up one fat official book with one hand.

                            KWALTZ (CONT'D)
                     -- and these are the forces we deploy to
                     apprehend any intentional or actual
                     kidnapper.

        He holds up another fat book with the other.

                            QUESTULAR
                     You are aware, Commander, that the
                     President kidnapped himself.

                            KWALTZ
                     Hence...

        He puts the two books together, slams them down.

                            QUESTULAR
                     Do you have any idea how ridiculous this
                     is?

                     just do what I do.

        A VOGON MESSENGER runs up holding papers. Kwaltz takes
        them, signs one in two places, initials others, lifts the
        top sheet, removes the pink copy. Folds it.

                     --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a
                     few things together and that's when I
                     realized I had this.

        CLOSE ON - the NUTRI-MATIC MACHINE. Brownish liquid
        flows into it a Martini glass, topped with dry-ice fog.

        Arthur removes the glass.    Sips.     Grimaces

                             TRILLIAN
                     I suppose I should have said it
                     resembles tea.

                             ARTHUR
                     So two heads is what does it for a girl,
                     then? I mean, if I'd had two heads. Or
                     three?

                             TRILLIAN
                     Or your own space ship.

                             ARTHUR
                     Well, what am I supposed to be like?
                     Green? Bleeping? What?

                             TRILLIAN
                     Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it

                     I mean...

        She points to his jaw, he nods, she picks up her BACKPACK.

                             TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                     I might have an aspirin.

        She unzips it. TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a
        hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail.

                              TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                     Hey.   What are they doing in there?

        Before she can catch them, they scurry under the door.

                             TRILLIAN {CONT'D)
                     They were from my lab at university.    Odd...

                             ARTHUR
                     So all that's left is me and you, "mostly
                     harmless," and two lab rats.

        She furrows her brow.     What does he mean?

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Look, there's something I should tell

        it in the trash bin.

                  --and when I saw what I'm about to show

44      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN --                                   44

        The screen brightens. A BRAND LOGO appears (a circle made
        of a dotted line with an "M" in the middle) then a sub-
        title: MAGRATHEAN PUBLIC ARCHIVE. Zaphod fast forwards
        until a noisy picture DISSOLVES TO...

45      EXT. OUTSIDE TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT -- DAY                  45

        A procession surrounds a CHARIOT. Two young philosophers,
        LUNKWILL and FOOK (20'S) ride it into a grand TEMPLE.

46      INT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT.                                46

        The aisles are lined with Priest-Technicians. Ahead is
        DEEP THOUGHT - a huge Buddha-esque computer.

        The procession peels away to both sides. Lunkwill and
        Fook dismount and approach.

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                     (deep and sonorous)
                  What is this great task for which I, Deep
                  Thought, the second greatest computer of
                  all time have been called into existence?

                          LUNKWILL
                  Your task, O computer...

                          FOOK
                  Hang on. Did you say second greatest?

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  Second greatest. Yes.

                          FOOK
                  But we designed you to be the greatest
                  computer so you could...

                          LUNKWILL
                  You're not talking about the Milliard
                  Gargantubrain which can count all the
                  atoms in a star in a millisecond?

                          DEEP THOUGHT
                  The Milliard Gargantubrain? A mere abacus,
                  mention it not.

                     Then what's the problem?

                     I am the greatest computer you are able to

                     Let's just ask the question.

                              FOOK
                     Oh Deep Thought, your task is this. We
                     want you to tell us -- the Answer.

        Long pause.    Deep Thought bleeps and bloops.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Answer...to what?

                              LUNKWILL
                     You know. The answer.      To Life...the
                     Universe...Everything.

                              FOOK
                     We'd really like an answer. Something
                     simple. Can you do it?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     The Ultimate Question of Life, the
                     Universe and Everything. Yes. There is an
                     answer. But I'll have to think about it.

        Lunkwill glances at his time piece, Fook at the expectant
        throng behind them. They wait.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Return to this place in exactly... seven and

        Lunkwill and Fook enter the now modern temple, flanked by a
        crowd. They have beards and look like they're in their
        40's. Deep Thought rises, looks lifeless. WORRIED MUTTERS
        FROM THE CROWD. Slowly, Deep Thought groans to life.

                  No, I tried that. "Why?" "Forty-two."
                  Doesn't work.
                     (to Trillian)
                  Let's get her ready, babe.

        He moves to a different rack of instruments, consults a
        check list, starts flipping some switches.

                          FORD
                  I mean, why do you want to know the
                  Ultimate Question?

                          ZAPHOD
                  Oh. Well -- partly the curiosity, partly
                  a sense of adventure, but mostly I think
                  it's for the fame and the money.

        He continues preparing the ship. Trillian consults the
        huge MANUAL, turning dials, flipping switches...

                          ARTHUR
                  But -- you're President of the Galaxy,
                  aren't you?

                  Yes, Arman.

                  Arthur.

                           ZAPHOD
                  Whatever. Presidential fame is temporary,
                  I find the Question, that's permanent. It
                  sticks. Plus everyone thinks you're deep.
                  Win-win.

        They turn to see Trillian flipping open a glass lid

        Zaphod smiles, all bright and cheery.

                             GUIDE VOICE
                     The Infinite Improbability Drive is a new
                     method of crossing vast interstellar
                     distances without all that tedious mucking
                     about in hyperspace. As soon as the drive
                     reaches Infinite Improbability, it passes
                     through every conceivable point in every
                     conceivable Universe almost simultaneously,
                     then selects the appropriate re-entry
                     point. The principle of generating small
                     amounts of finite improbability by hooking
                     the logic circuits of a Bambleweeny 57 Sub-
                     Meson Brain to an atomic vector plotter

                     producer, say a nice hot cup of tea, were
                     of course well understood.

        Seconds later, the Vogon Destroyer comes out of
        hyperspace and slows to cruising speed.

                     Such generators were often used to break

                     This is ridiculous! What do you need, an
                     executive order? Fine. I order you. Stop
                     doing this! Go and get him!

                             KWALTZ
                     According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2,
                     you're not authorized to make such an
                     order.

                             KWALTZ
                     Then act like a president, and do nothing.

        Kwaltz continues to fill out the forms. Questular grabs
        a clump of his hair -- and pulls it out.

                                                            CUT TO:

56      EXT. VILTVODLE 6. SPACEPORT. - NIGHT                          56

        All we can see are the lights of the Heart of Gold's
        entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. Or is it fog?

        Zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead
        of the other three.

                             ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     Humma Kavula!

        BACK A FEW STEPS WITH ARTHUR, TRILLIAN AND FORD...

                             ARTHUR
                     Why does he keep saying that?

                             TRILLIAN
                     I don't know. I'm not used to seeing him
                     this way.

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean fully clothed?

        She stops, fires him a look.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Sorry, but I can't for the life of me
                     figure out why you, the most brilliant
                     woman I have ever met, have ended up with
                     that half-witted, self-obsessed, vapid
                     politician! I mean, look at him!

        They squint through the fog at Zaphod, Head 2 out. His
        hands keep trying to get it down but the 3rd arm keeps
        whacking them away. He disappears into the fog.

                        (back to Arthur)
                     Look, if you're going to pout your way
                     around space, then maybe you should just
                     go home.

                              ARTHUR
                     I can't. That's the whole point -- and
                     I've been trying to tell you...

                              FORD
                        (interrupting)
                     Hey, look what I found in the guide.

        He hands the guide to Trillian. She keeps walking.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     I wouldn't tell her if I were you.

                             ARTHUR
                     She deserves to know.

                              FORD
                     But if you tell her and she ends up with
                     you because you're literally the last guy
                     on Earth -- you'll always doubt her
                     intentions.

        Arthur considers this.      Nods.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                     Got your towel?

                             ARTHUR
                     Do I need it?

                             FORD
                     Only always.

        Ford puts his towel to his mouth as they follow Trillian
        down the mist covered street. She's reading the guide.

                     In the beginning, the universe was created.
                     This made a lot of people very angry and
                     has been widely regarded as a bad move.

        Zaphod continues several steps ahead of them.

        SLAM.   Zaphod's two arms shove his chin back down.

                           ZAPHOD
                   I'll handle this.

56a     EXT. SEEDY STREET-VILTVODLE                                   56a

        The others approach, watching Zaphod as he stops a
        passing an eight-armed alien creature, asks him
        something, oozing charm. The creature points down the
        street with 3 arms, then with 2 others hands him a pen
        and paper. Zaphod signs an autograph and moves on.

        The alien beams, then squirts three cans of aerosol under
        several arms. More mist rises. FOLLOW IT UP revealing:

57      A LARGE BUILDING -- a temple with two giant arches.           57

        The others follow. CAMERA TILTS UP and we see this
        building looks like a nose lying horizontally, the "giant
        arches" are the nostrils.

58      INT. ARKLESEIZURE TEMPLE - CONTINUOUS                         58

        Zaphod opens the huge doors inside the large
        nostril/arches. A rush of air blows the mist past Ford,
        Trillian and Arthur a few steps behind. They stop.

        A congregation of worshipers faces front where HUMMA KAVULA
        stands behind a podium. He's a humanoid wearing a white
        robe and night-vision sun glasses.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   The handkerchief is coming, beloveds. Are
                   you ready? Let us pray that the almighty
                   will exhale a breath of compassion on us.

        Instead of bowing, they all point their noses heavenward.
        Zaphod marches down the center aisle while Humma prays.

                           HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                   Almighty Arkleseizure, we lift our noses,
                   clogged and unblown in reverence to you.

        Zaphod stops a few feet away from Humma's chair.

                   Hello, Humma.

                        (shaking his head)
                     Humma Kavula was his opponent in the
                     election. Something happened during the
                     campaign. Zaphod never forgave him.

                             ARTHUR
                     What was it?

        Ford shrugs.    HUMMA looks up, sees Zaphod, smiles.

                             HUMMA KAVULA
                        (wrapping up the prayer)
                     Send the handkerchief, lord, so that it may

        raises a hand to his nose, then down again.

        Humma's quarters are opulent. He sits behind his desk
        flanked by several ARMED BODY GUARDS. Ford, Arthur and
        Trillian keep a safe distance as Zaphod faces off with
        Humma who has the air of a cool news anchor man.

                 Zaphod Beeblebrox, our famous President.
                 The Arkleseizure has exhaled many

        Head 2 suddenly springs up -- to the surprise of all.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 You called me stupid!

                 Interesting. And I don't know what you're
                 talking about.

                         ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                 During the campaign, Humma -- you said I
                 was stupid.

                         HUMMA KAVULA
                 This Humma you speak of no longer exists.
                 He came here in his consolation position
                 as Ambassador to Gamma Z10 to squelch an
                 ideological threat to the system and
                 repented from his wicked ways. He now
                 goes by the holy name Tazelo the
                 Unceasingly Righteous, given to him by his
                 devoted followers.

                            ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                     I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU CALL YOURSELF, YOU
                     RIGHTEOUS FREAK!! YOU STARTED THE RUMOR
                     THAT I'M STUPID AND YOU'RE GONNA PAY!!!

        The 3rd arm reaches for a gun in Zaphod's vest. The BODY
        GUARDS aim their weapons. One runs up and smacks Zaphod
        in the back of the head -- slamming Head 2 back in place.

                            ZAPHOD
                     Thank you.

        The 3rd arm disappears.      The gun falls.   A BODY GUARD
        picks it up.

        WITH ARTHUR, FORD AND TRILLIAN

                            ARTHUR
                     Why do I get the feeling he's going to get
                     us all killed?

                            FORD
                     Probably because it's very possible.    Just
                     don't save me, okay? We're even.

        Humma lays his palms on the table and lifts himself as if
        to stand - but there is nothing of him below the table
        line except for thirty, one inch metal legs, attached to
        the base of his torso. He glides towards Zaphod, the
        little legs extending to reach the floor as he reaches
        the end of the table.

                  The election is ancient history, Zaphod,
                  but if memory serves -- you won, proving
                  that good looks and charm win over
                  brilliance and ability to govern.

        A guard drapes a white robes over Humma's shoulders - which
        he ties with a belt - hiding his peculiar undercarriage.

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  And incidently -- you are stupid.

        His head jerks up.   Zaphod stops it, paints on a smile.

                          ZAPHOD
                  That's really not the point.

                          HUMMA KAVULA
                  You haven't come halfway across the galaxy
                  to settle a campaign grudge. Why are you
                  here, Zaphod?

        Zaphod doesn't answer. Humma motions to a guard who
        grabs his arm, twists it -- hard.

                          ZAPHOD
                     (wincing)
                  I don't know. I was headed for Magrathea,

        PUSH IN ON HUMMA -- who raises his hi-tech sun glasses.

        He pulls the nose off his body guard, turns a key.    A
        secret safe door slides open from the mans' chest.

                  I kept a few souvenirs from my former
                  life. Ah, the heady days of space
                  piracy... so young, so foolish..,

        Another, smaller box rises from the chest cabinet. Inside
        we see glowing jewels, a skeleton hand, etc. Humma
        removes a PINK CUBE (like Zaphod's blue cube.)

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  I'll gladly give you the coordinates to
                  Magrathea...

        He holds up the pink cube revealing A SERIES OF
        COORDINATE NUMBERS on each side. Zaphod reaches for it.
        Humma takes it back...

                          HUMMA KAVULA (CONT'D)
                  ...provided you bring me something in
                  return.

                             HUMMA KAVULA
                   A gun.

                             ZAPHOD
                   A gun?

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   A very special gun. Designed by the
                   greatest computer ever invented, now
                   buried in the bowels of Magrathea.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Fine. I'll get your gun.    Just give me
                   the coordinates.

        Zaphod reaches out.    Humma pulls it back.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   And what will you give me to insure your
                   return?

                           ZAPHOD
                   My word as President.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   Ha! I'd be better off with the dung of a
                   Bethusian Mega Donkey.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Okay, then I'll get you that.

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   I need a hostage, something you hold dear.
                   Only what does Zaphod Beeblebrox treasure?

        ON ZAPHOD'S SECOND HEAD -- peeping out of the collar
        looking terrified.

        Humma smiles. Bingo. He signals the guards. They grab
        Zaphod who looks back to Trillian, offers a weak smile.

        Zaphod's head hangs on the wall. Wires feed out of the
        neck into a huge machine.
        Beneath the head is a crude drawing of a body and the
        words "I'm with Stupid." An arrow points to Zaphod's
        Head 2 -- which is shouting...

                           ZAPHOD HEAD 2
                   IDIOT! ZARKING MORON!! COME BACK!! YOU

                           HUMMA KAVULA
                   You should quit while you're "a head"
                   Zaphod. No one has ever got passed the
                   Magrathean defence system alive.

        Humma laughs maniacally.

62      EXT. VILTVODLE 6. MAIN STREET - NIGHT                       62

        Zaphod, held aloft on Ford and Arthur's shoulders,
        staggers down the street toward the spaceport where the
        Heart of Gold is parked. His neck is wrapped with a
        blood-soaked bandage which looks like a scarlet ascot.

                           ARTHUR
                   Are we sure this is the right way?

                            FORD
                   Yes!   I think.   I don't know.   Maybe not.

                           ARTHUR
                   Yes, thank you for clearing that up.

        Ford looks puzzled at Arthur. Did I clear it up? A crowd
        has gathered. When they see Zaphod, they scream...

                           CROWD
                   Mr. President!...Zaphod, over here!...I
                   want to have your baby!, etc...

        Zaphod, still feeling the effects of whatever drugs he
        was given, dons a presidential smile and waves.

                           FORD
                   Back to the ship. Quickly.

        They quicken their pace when suddenly...

        FIFTY VOGON POLICE -- emerge from the mist.

                           VOGON POLICE #1
                   Mr. President! We are here for your
                   protection!

        Zaphod, Ford, Trillian and Arthur freeze in their tracks.

         The police fire.      F, T, & A run for it, but Z stays put.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Zarquon! Friendly fire! Well, if that's
                    what they want--

         He pulls out his gun up and fires back.

                            ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                    Hey! Let's do lunch! Nice haircut, fella!
                    Hey! Your kids are the same age as mine--
                    We should get them together some time!

         With each line he fires. Ford grabs him. Shots hit a
         stack of aerosol cans. They EXPLODE. More mist rises.

         The gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk.
         Zaphod sports a goofy smile. Arthur is scared to death.

                            ARTHUR
                    Oh God, I really hate Thursdays.

                            FORD
                    Zaphod, what do we do?

                            ZAPHOD
                    Build bridges between the stars!
                    He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon.

                               ARTHUR
                    What?

                            FORD
                    I think that was his campaign slogan.

         Trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea.

                            TRILLIAN
                    Alright, follow me.
               She aims the can at Zaphod's ear- Arthur's face registers
               the madness of the moment.

          continues anxiously forward, eyeing the police whose guns
          track their every move.

(62 cont) The police step backwards -- but the crowd takes a step       (62 cont)
          forward. A huddle of female ADMIRERS rush them, waving
          pens and paper as if the Beatles have arrived.

                               ADMIRERS
                       Mr. President, Mr. President!...

            Zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to
            go sign a few autographs.

                              FEMALE ADMIRER
                      I totally voted for you!

(62 cont) CHAOS! The walrusy Vogon police swarm in like maggots,        (62 cont)
          surrounding Trillian and edging Ford and Arthur away.

                               VOGON POLICE
                       Resistance is useless!

            Shots are fired. The crowd SCREAMS and SCATTERS. Arthur
            reaches for Trillian but she is engulfed by Vogons who
            move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist.

                                ARTHUR
                      Tricia!

            Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using
            his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the
            Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship.

                     emergency back-up.

                             EDDIE
                     How, if you want me to take you somewhere,
                     we're going to have to start using our
                     magic words, "please" and "thank you."

                             ARTHUR
                     Can you change it back?

                             MARVIN
                     I can -- but I won't enjoy it.

                             EDDIE
                     I'm wait-ing...

        Arthur sees the Vogon ships getting away. Desperate, he
        shoves_Zaphod out of_the_driver's seat. Zaphod hits the
        floor, considers protesting, lies down on the floor to
        sleep instead -- with a contented smile.

        Arthur sits. He looks very out of place in a seat
        normally reserved for the likes of Han Solo. He scans
        the console. Ford sits in the seat beside him.

                               ARTHUR
                     Ford?

                               FORD
                     Marvin?

                     Don't look at me.   I'm too depressed.

                     I can see this relationship is something
                     we're all going to have to work at.

64a     DING. A chime sounds. A switch on the console                 64a
        ILLUMINATES. "MANUAL OVERRIDE." Arthur flips the switch.
        The cockpit is sealed in a glass ball and shoots upwards.

        The cockpit bubble POPS out like an ejector seat, now a
        little glass pod. It floats through space, then rear
        thrusters ignite and blast the ship forward.

        An aircraft steering wheel rises up between Arthur's
        legs. He grabs it, spinning out of control.

                             FORD
                     I think I should push this button.

        Ford pushes a big button.    AN ALARM SOUNDS!

                     What's that? What happened?!

                     A sign lit up saying "Please do not push

        Arthur grabs the control, does his best to steer.

    9    DIFFERENT PART OF VOGSPHERE/NEAR SWAMP--                          69

         The ground is barren. A scintillatingly jeweled crab
         crawls out of a swamp and looks up at the sky. We hear
         the sound of the pod approaching (but hold on the crab)
         as EEEOOOO-KA-KFFFZZZ! The crab runs back into the
         swamp. PAN LEFT to see the pod rammed into the ground,
         steam rising. The door opens. The three emerge.

                              FORD
                    Wow...

                              MARVIN
                    I know.    Dreadful, isn't it?

                            ARTHUR
                    Sorry about the landing.    Where are we?

                            ZAPHOD
                    Magrathea!

                            FORD
                    Wrong. This is the Vogon planet.     This is
                    Vogsphere.

                             ZAPHOD
                    No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it!

         Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of
         ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head.

                            FORD
                    Little something I learned about on an
                    Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them
                    when they really need to concentrate.

                            ARTHUR
                    What is it?

                            FORD
                    A Thinking Cap.

         Zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around.

         THEIR P.O.V. -- there are rows and rows of dull, gray,
         rectangular buildings as far as the eye can see.

(69 cont) The three men step out of the ship.                          (69 cont)

                    This will all end in tears, I just know

         Marvin moves out, a few paces behind.

                            FORD
                    I checked the guide for ways to rescue a
                    prisoner from Vogsphere. It said "Don't."
                    I'm assuming your plan is better.

        A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of
        the ground, SMACKS Arthur on the face, then retracts.

        Arthur is stunned. None of the others have noticed.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Did anyone see that?

        They look at Arthur. It suddenly seems ridiculous.

                             ARTHUR
                     Nothing.

        They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed.

                     Nothing. Just my imagination.

        Another paddle springs up, double smack in the face.
        Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch

                     Okay.     I think we...

        A paddle springs up and smacks Ford's face.

                     AH!

        He leaps back, clutching his cheeks.      Arthur spins around.

                  I have... an idea.

        A paddle shoots up. Ford ducks. It misses. He grabs its
        telescopic stalk. It thrashes in his hands. He breaks it.

                         FORD (CONT'D)
                  Okay, don't think of anything.     Don't have
                  ideas or theories -- nothing.

        A beat. They all strain to think of nothing.     Several
        paddles shoot up. Smacking them.

                         ARTHUR
                  I can't, help it!    Trillian is in there
                  somewhere and we need an idea to save her.

                          FORD
                  Ever the politician.

        They take off running. A forest of paddle stalks erupts
        out of the ground around them, smacking violently.

        They come to rest at the side of a Vogon building.

                          ARTHUR

         The front doors BURST open. Arthur storms through them,
         holding Marvin's arm which has the fingers pointed like a
         gun. He trips, falls, drops the arm, picks it up again,
         trying hard to look tough. Ford and Zaphod follow, Zaphod
         wearing the Thinking Cap and sunglasses for disguise.
         Ford wearing his towel over his face like a bandit.

        He raises Marvin's arm, pointing the fingers.

            Trillian sits at the Officer's desk, arms folded, defiant.

                               TRILLIAN
                       I don't believe you. This is some sort of
                       trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet,
                       especially mine.

            Kwaltz now steps forward and extends a piece of paper.

                               KWALTZ
                       These are the orders.

            Trillian takes the paper, runs her finger down to the
            signature line where it reads "Love and kisses, Zaphod!"

                               TRILLIAN
                       Love and kisses...?

            She hands the paper back, swallowing emotion.

                               KWALTZ
                       Now -- according to Section 8, sub-section
                       34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping
                       is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode
                       to the Removal of Your Left Kidney."
                       Unless -- said kidnapping is of the
                       President, in which case you are to be fed
                       to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal.
                       We thank you for your cooperation.

            A door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box.
            A huge, angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window.

            The box shakes like crazy. Trillian gulps.

            Zaphod is in line with Arthur and Ford.     He looks up to:

            A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTOGRAPH -- of himself, in suit and tie,
            smiling broadly. He lowers his thinking cap.

                               FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                       Next!

            Arthur steps up, followed by Ford and Zaphod who keeps
            his head low and bowed.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a
                       prisoner released?

                               FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                       Prisoner release form?

            She holds out her hand. Arthur doesn't have a form.
            Annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is
            nothing but shelves holding forms.

                  Right. Once I've filled it out can I
                  return to the front of the line, seeing as
                  I've already waited...

                              FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  No.     Next!

        Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the
        shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod.

                           ARTHUR
                  Can't you do something?!     You're
                  President, aren't you?

                           ZAPHOD
                  You want me to make a speech, shake a
                  hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's
                  all a little fuzzy.

        Arthur angrily fills out the form.

        MOMENTS LATER--

        Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He
        finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the
        Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks
        the screen.

                          FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR
                  This Prisoner is being detained for...
                     (reading)
                  Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for
                  release at this time. You can make an
                  appointment for a later date or take a
                  number and wait.

        Arthur's breathing quickens.     He can't take this.

                          ARTHUR
                  Alright, look.
                      (yanks thinking cap and
                       sunglasses off Zaphod)
                  This is the President.

        She looks at Zaphod, then back to the large portrait of
        Zaphod, then back to Zaphod. She nods. Okay...

                              ARTHUR   (CONT'D)
                      He says the whole kidnapping thing was a
                      terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean
                      anything by it and he's ordering you to
                      let her go.

                         (holding up green form)
                      But this isn't a Presidential Release of

        She points to the wall of forms. Arthur sighs.

            She reviews the form, stamps it, pulls off the carbon
            copy underneath, hands that to Zaphod.

            As she braces herself to be eaten by the monster.
            Suddenly, a couple of VOGON GUARDS enter and hand Kwaltz
            a blue piece of paper. He reviews it, then signs it.

                               KWALTZ
                       You're free to go.    Release her.

            The Vogon Guard pulls Trillian up and out of the box on a
            cable. The Bugblatter beast goes berserk.

                               QUESTULAR

                       He's here?! Zaphod is here!? Let's go
                       get him!

            But the Guard is already escorting Trillian out of the
            room. Kwaltz is completing paperwork.

            Kwaltz holds up a walrusy hand, one finger raised,
            silencing Questular while he continues. Questular sighs.

            We hear the Bugblatter beast weeping as the doors are
            closed on him.

         through the stars.

                             EDDIE
                        (back to his normal voice)
                     Hi, fellas. Hold on to your hats!

                              ZAPHOD
                     Eddie!   Welcome back!

        The ship suddenly BLASTS forward. Their heads are
        slammed back into the seats as they VIBRATE VIOLENTLY.

                             FORD
                     WHAT'S HAPPENING, ZAPHOD?!   WHERE DID YOU
                     TELL IT TO GO?!

                             ZAPHOD
                     I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING!

        Arthur looks to the console and sees the two mice sliding
        across it, getting thrown across the ship. They continue
        to vibrate -- even more violently.

                             FORD
                     ARE YOU SURE WE REATTACHED THIS THING THE
                     RIGHT WAY?!

        Zaphod is all smiles, hanging on as if he were on a
        rollercoaster ride.

                             ZAPHOD
                     ISN'T IT GREAT?!

82      DEEP SPACE--                                                   82

        ...the H.O.G. is but a blur as it streaks along.

83      BACK IN THE H.O.G. - LATER                                     83

        Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace.

                             EDDIE
                     Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you
                     we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma
                     Z8B530.

        Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still
        staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and
        moves away from the console.

        A planet appears on screen.     Zaphod and Ford lean
        forward.

                             ZAPHOD
                     Okay, that's it...I think. Computer?      Is
                     that...where are we headed again?

        Arthur turns, look over at...

        TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the
        emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek.

        Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say.

                             ARTHUR
                     Look, you're right. You deserved to know
                     and I should've told you. I don't blame
                     you if you're angry.

        She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     Can't speak.

                              ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                     Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry.

                             EDDIE (O.S.)
                     Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you
                     we are currently in orbit at an altitude
                     of three hundred miles around the
                     legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee.

        Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn.

                          ZAPHOD
                       (tasting it)
                     Take us in.

83a     EXT. NIGHT DEEP SPACE - MAGRATHEA                              83a

        They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which
        gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash
        with light.

        Two suns rise behind the planet.     It's breathtaking.

                             ZAPHOD
                     The twin suns of Soulianis and Rahm...

        Marvin (both arms in tact) rises in the back, peers out.

                             MARVIN
                     It's rubbish.

83b     Suddenly,a ghostly white swirl of light, vaguely in the        83b
        shape of a man, appears on the screen before them.

                     council of Magrathea thanks you for your
                     esteemed visit, but regrets that the entire
                     planet is temporarily closed for business.
                     If you would like to leave your name and a
                     planet where you can be contacted, kindly
                     do so at the tone.

                      Closed? How can a planet be closed?

                               ZAPHOD
                      For once, Aldus, I agree with you. Okay,

                              EDDIE
                      Happy to!

         The ship eases forward. The image appears again.

                              GHOSTLY IMAGE
                      It is most gratifying that your enthusiasm
                      for our planet continues unabated.    As a
                      token of our appreciation, we hope you
                      will enjoy the two thermonuclear missiles
                      we've just sent to converge with your
                      craft. To ensure on-going quality of
                      service, your death may be monitored for

         The image vanishes. A beat.    Then...

                              EDDIE
                      Guys, I'm delighted to tell you there are
                      two thermonuclear missiles headed right
                      for us. Should I take evasive action?

83c      The screens show two huge rockets thundering at us,               83c
         Zaphod just smiles. Ford steps up.

                              FORD
                      Um...yes, computer.   Evade!

         Massive acceleration! An illuminated dome lowers from the
         ceiling over the crew seats - creating a safety pod.

84       EXT. ABOVE MAGRATHEA. DAWN                                        84

         The Heart of Gold streaks away. Two large missiles follow
         and mimic the H.O.G.'s every move.

                      There seems to be something jamming my
                      guidance systems. Impact minus 45

            Big swell of Muzak. The ship drops like a stone.
            THE MISSILES -- miss, then turn in a screeching curve.

            Zaphod tries to wrestle with three controls.

                                  ZAPHOD
                          I can't do this without my other arm!

                          No.   They're right behind us.

            He looks down, sees the IMPROBABILITY DRIVE BUTTON.

                                  ARTHUR
                          Look, why don't I just hit this thing?

                                   ZAPHOD
                          NO! We're here! No telling where it will

             The missiles turn and accelerate high into the sky. A
             second set of boosters kick in on the missiles as they
             soar back toward the H.O.G. --- much, much faster.

(85 cont) ON THE BRIDGE--                                                  (85 cont)

            They all stare at the approaching missiles. Arthur looks
            at the drive button. Screw it. He flips open the glass
            lid.
                               ZAPHOD
                       NO!

            Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A

            by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.

        It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety
        dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact
        same place they were - dazed.

                           ZAPHOD
                   Um...where are we?

                           TRILLIAN
                   Exactly where we were, I think.

                           ZAPHOD
                   And the missiles?

                           FORD
                   Have apparently turned into a bowl of
                   petunias and a very surprised looking
                   whale.

        He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by.

                           EDDIE
                   At an improbability factor of eight
                   million, seven hundred and sixty-seven
                   thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to
                   one against.

        They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his
        approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even?

        He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves
        on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile.

                          ARTHUR
                  I could really use a cup of tea.

88      EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                          88

        The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops
        rising, starts falling.

                          GUIDE VOICE
                  It is important to note that suddenly, and
                  against all probability, a sperm whale had
                  been called into existence several miles
                  above the surface of an alien planet. And
                  since this is not a naturally tenable
                  position for a whale, this innocent
                  creature had very little time to come to
                  terms with its identity as a whale before
                  it then had to come to terms with suddenly
                  not being a whale any more. This is what
                  it thought as it fell.

        The camera moves around the whale as it falls.

                     want to make any headway in what for the
                     sake of what I shall call an argument I
                     shall call the world, so let's call it my
                     stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite
                     strong now. And hey,what's this whistling
                     roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly
                     going to call my head? Perhaps I can call
                     that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll
                     do. Perhaps I can give it a better name
                     later when I've found out what it's for!
                     It must be very important because there
                     certainly seems to be an awful lot of it.
                     Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call
                     it a tail - yeah! Tail!

        The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the
        whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight.

                             WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty
                     good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to
                     achieve much but I'll probably find out
                     what it's for later on. How. Have I built
                     up a coherent picture of things yet?
                     No. Never mind. Hey, this is really
                     exciting, so much to find out about, ao
                     much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy
                     with anticipation ... Or is it the wind?
                     There really is an awful lot of that now,
                     isn't there?

        It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the
        whale, abandoning it ...

                             WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                     And hey! What's this thing coming
                     suddenly coming towards me very fast, so
                     big and flat and round it needs a big
                     wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round
                     ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if
                     it'll be friends with me?

        We hear a sickening thud o.s.

                     Curiously, the only thing that went
                     through the mind of the bowl of petunias
                     as it fell was "Oh no, not again."

        We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING.

                             GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D)
                     Many have speculated that if we knew why
                     the bowl of petunias had thought that we
                     would know a lot more about the nature of
                     the Universe than we do now.

89      EXT. HEART OF GOLD. MAGRATHEA SURFACE - DAY                   89

        The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the
        b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it --
        along with a few petunias. They all grimace.

        BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks,
        aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight.

        They walk toward it.

90      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     90

        Arthur walks behind the others, his head down.

                             FORD (O.S.)
                     Hey...this looks familiar.

        Arthur looks up, registers surprise.

        THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer.
        The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN
        DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS"

                             FORD (CONT'D}
                     Must be portal doors.

                             ARTHUR
                     You mean -- the hippies were right?

        In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist
        desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH."

        Zaphod heads for the "To Design Department" stone.
        Trillian and Ford follow.

        Zaphod feels around it, looking for a switch, a knob,
        anything. He must've hit something because the front of
        the stone suddenly slides open revealing a SWIRLING
        VORTEX THAT LOOKS LIKE A JET ENGINE.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Okay.   In we go.

                     What?! Are you out of what's left of your
                     mind? We can't step into that...that.

                             FORD
                     We gotta pick one, right? If it's not the
                     right one, we come back and pick another.
                     No biggie.

                             ARTHUR
                     Yes -- big biggie. What if that's the
                     last door we ever step through? What if
                     it rips us into tiny little atomic
                     particle...thingies.

        Trillian, who hasn't said a word since leaving Vogsphere,
        covers her ears - trying to block them out

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's the right one.   I have a hunch.

                               ARTHUR
                     Ford..?

                             FORD
                     He's got good hunches.   I say we go.

                             ARTHUR
                     Go with the hunch of a narcissist with
                     half a brain who's wearing a ridiculous
                     thinking cap!? Are you insane?!

                             ZAPHOD
                     Hey, I think I resent that.

                             ARTHUR
                     I don't care what you think you think...

        They all start arguing over each other. We focus on
        Trillian -- Anger and frustration building, she covers
        her ears -- then screams....

                             TRILLIAN
                     AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!

        And she takes off running for the door. Suicide? Bravery?

        They turn just in time to see her jump into the vortex.
        She YELPS as her body is bent in half, twisted like a
        rung mop, then sucked inside.

        Arthur is horrified, literally gasping for air.      Ford is
        semi-impressed. Zaphod, unfazed.

                             ZAPHOD
                     That's supposed to happen...I think.

        Ford shrugs, throws his towel around his neck like a
        scarf and dives through. Same thing. Bent, twisted...

                  Hey, wait for me!

        He runs after Ford, stops at the door, turns like he's
        about to board Air Force one, gives a salute, jumps in.

        Arthur finally gets his legs to move, steps up -- but
        hesitates at the threshold, paralyzed with fear, unable
        to take a step. Then -- FFSSSSH - the door seals shut.

                               ARTHUR
                  No.    No!     NOOO!!!

        He bangs on the stone, slides his hand around like Zaphod
        did, desperately looking for a way to open it. He
        collapses and buries his head in his hands.

                          MARVIN
                  I told you this would all end in tears.

                                                            CUT TO:

91      EXT. TEMPLE OF DEEP THOUGHT - MOMENTS LATER                   91

        Ford stands outside a stone doorway at the end of a
        cobblestone street. Zaphod's body falls to the ground
        next to him, untwists, unbends and snaps bolt upright
        beside them.

        Trillian is already heading down the street toward the
        Temple. Ford and Zaphod hurry to catch up to her.

92      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     92

        Arthur sits with his back against the stone, staring
        across the field at the beautiful double sunset. He looks
        over and sees THE TWO MICE FROM THE SHIP -- scurrying
        toward one of the giant stone doors. They slip through a
        crack beneath the stone. A FLASH OF LIGHT bursts through
        the crack. Arthur barely reacts, so drained of emotion.

                          ARTHUR
                  Life is full of paradoxes, isn't it?

                          MARVIN
                  Don't talk to me about life.

                          ARTHUR
                  Here I am, God knows how far from home...

                          MARVIN
                  Don't talk to me about God.

                          ARTHUR
                  ...and this is where I see the most
                  spectacular sunset I've ever laid eyes on.
                  We only had the one sun at home. Planet
                  called Earth.

                     Oh no, it's beautiful.    Or at least, it

                     Did it have oceans?

                     So this is how it will all end, then? Me,
                     on a dead planet -- with a manically

                     You think you've got problems? What are

                     intelligent than you and even I don't know
                     the answer. It gives me a headache just

                     Aah!

        He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man.

                             ARTHUR (CONT'D)

                    Late   as in "the late Dentarthurdent."
                    It's   a sort of threat you see. Never been
                    much   good at them myself, but I'm told
                    they   can be terribly effective.

        He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom."

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Your friends are safe. You can trust me.

                            ARTHUR
                    Trust a man who won't tell me his name?

                    My name? Very well...
                       (heaves a sigh, reluctant)
                    My name is...Slartibartfast.

        Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D)
                    I said it wasn't important.

        Slartibartfast motions to the door.     He looks to Marvin.

                             MARVIN
                    I could calculate your chances of survival
                    -- but you won't like it.

        Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    I must warn you. We are about to pass
                    through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It
                    may disturb you. It scares the willies out
                    of me.

        He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and
        presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the
        jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you.

        Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in.

                    Whaa!

        He is bent, twisted and sucked away.     Slarti follows.

        Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to...

                    possibly get any worse, it suddenly does.

        Kwaltz sits in his chair as they press forward. The
        GHOSTLY IMAGE of the recorded message appears.

94      INT. MAGRATHEA/PLANET SHOWROOM - DAY                          94

        Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   I told you you might find it a bit
                   disturbing.

                           ARTHUR
                   I have found this whole day a bit
                   disturbing.

        Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his
        mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices...

        ...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only
        instead of cars there are models of various planets.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST
                   Did you know we built planets?

        No.   Arthur didn't know that.   He looks perplexed.

                           SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                   Fascinating trade. Doing the coastlines
                   was always my favorite. Used to have
                   endless fun doing all the little fiddly
                   bits round fjords. But the Galactic
                   economy collapsed, and seeing that custom-
                   built planets are something of a luxury
                   commodity...
                        (getting back on subject)
                   At any rate, there's been a terrible mix
                   up with your planet. You must come with me
                   or it's all going to blow up in our faces.

                           ARTHUR
                   ...and men.

                     I don't think men have got much to do with
                     it.

        Arthur looks confused.     Slarti motions him to a door.

95      Arthur readies his towel at his mouth as Slarti hits a        95
        button. The door slides open and nothing happens. It's
        just a door that leads to a room where several TRANSPORT
        CARTS move past -- like a kids ride at Disneyland. They
        step into one. Slarti closes the little door. The cart
        MOVES through a curtain, out into DEEP SPACE.

        PULL BACK - till the cart is no more than a speck being
        pushed forward by the longest telescoping arm in history.

        Ford, Zaphod and Trillian enter the dimly lit temple.
        They hear a faint, tinny sound. They follow it.

        FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR...

        The sound gets louder. Tinny music. And laughter...
        Flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.

                             ZAPHOD
                     This is it!

        He quickens his pace. Trillian and Ford follow.      They
        round the corner to find...

        DEEP THOUGHT -- sitting there majestically.     The TINNY
        MUSIC emanates from somewhere near him.

        Zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of
        the TINNY MUSIC.

        Deep Thought is watching TV.     A violent, stupid cartoon.

                             ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                     Deep Thought...!

                     Shhh.   This is a good bit.

        The cartoon continues. Zaphod enters, removes his
        thinking cap and reverently approaches. He kneels...

                     Oh great Deep Thought...we have traveled
                     long...and far.
                     Have you calculated... the Ultimate
                     Question? Of Life, the Universe and

                              DEEP THOUGHT

                     Oh...

        Zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     I designed another computer to perform
                     that great task.

                             ZAPHOD
                     Oh, right...I forgot.
                        (looking around)
                     Is it here?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Not here. Another world.

                             ZAPHOD
                     It's on another world?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     It is another world. Or was.

                              ZAPHOD
                     Where?

                             DEEP THOUGHT
                     Ask your companion.

        Zaphod turns to Ford.     Ford looks confused.

                             DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D)
                     Not him.

        Zaphod looks to Trillian. She looks equally confused.
        Zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. Strains hard.

                             ZAPHOD

                  The show's back on.

        A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume.

        Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that
        smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed.

                          ZAPHOD
                  Great. This is just great. Let's go find
                  something else for my entire life to be
                  about.

        He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm.

                          FORD
                  Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us
                  for? We have to get it. You gave the guy
                  your head.

                            ZAPHOD
                  I know.    Why did I do that?

        He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his
        eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns...

                          FORD
                  Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have
                  a g...

        Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall
        slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A
        robotic arm pushes it forward.

        Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's
        nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away,

        CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT

        Ford hands Zaphod the gun.

                             FORD (CONT'D)
                  Here.     Take it. I don't do guns.

        Zaphod takes it with a smile...

                          ZAPHOD
                  Thank you.

        ...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for
        it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's
        finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is
        pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has

                  Yeah.    I kinda like this.

         She take the gun from him.

                          TRILLIAN
                  A gun that makes people suddenly see
                  things from your point of view. Useful
                  tool for the deranged evangelist trying to
                  convert the masses, eh?

         She starts walking.

                          TRILLIAN (CONT'D)
                  We should get back. Arthur's waiting.

                          ZAPHOD
                  Who cares?

                          TRILLIAN
                     (spinning on him; pointed)
                  I do -- especially since we're both
                  somewhat of an endangered species now.

                   Why so edgy?

         She can't believe he's asking this.     She aims the gun,
         CLICK!

                           ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                   Of course you're edgy, your planet's been
                   blown up and you've been tooling around
                   the Galaxy with the guy who signed the
                   order

         CLICK.   She shoots him again.

                           ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                   You actually wanted to know the Question
                   because you always thought there was more
                   to life, and now you're crushed because
                   you find out there really isn't.

         She's getting angrier and more hurt.     CLICK.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      You've got no home, no family, no one to
                      be with -- and you're stuck with me,
                      another in a long line of men who doesn't
                      appreciate you because he's too busy
                      appreciating himself.

         Hearing this puts a lump in her throat, causes her eyes
         to well with tears. She lowers the gun.

         Zaphod shakes his head -- the effect wearing off.       But he
         realizes what he said and doesn't like it.

                              ZAPHOD (CONT'D)
                      Give me that thing.

         He grabs the gun, points it at her.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Won't affect me.   I'm already a woman.

         Before he can react, A BRIGHT LIGHT SHINES BEHIND THEM.
         They turn, shielding their eyes.

                              ZAPHOD
                      Uh oh -- oh. It's okay, it's only a

                      Here we are, then. Look familiar?

         Arthur turns and looks. There before him is...

    O1a   EARTH -- Arthur is thunderstruck...then confused.           101a

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- it wasn't destroyed?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Actually, it was. This is a back-up.
                    Earth Mark II.

                            ARTHUR
                    So you're saying you ... made the Earth?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Well, not me alone. It was a group
                    effort. I did my part, though. Ever heard
                    of a place, I think it's called Norway?

101b      Arthur nods. The cart pushes through the clouds, towards    101b
          Ayers Rock. A GUY ON A LADDER is painting it it's
          familiar red color. Some of it is still primer grey.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    That was one of mine. Won an award you
                    know. Lovely crinkly edges. I was sorry
                    to hear about it being blown up. Shocking
                    cock up. The mice were furious.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mice?    Who cares about bloody mice?

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    Are you a fan of plate tectonics?

          Arthur looks up.   Slartibartfast points down.

101c      ANOTHER MAN pushes a button causing mountains to spring     101c
          up noisily.

                             SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Voila!   Himalayas. Good, eh?

          Arthur is working very hard to process all this.

101d      JUMP CUT. They move through a forest where a man presses    101d
          a lever making several MUSHROOMS pop up on the ground.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D)
                    Earthman, you must realize that the planet
                    you lived on was commissioned, paid for,
                    and run by mice. It was destroyed shortly
                    before the completion of the purpose for
                    which it was built. Ten minutes later, we
                    would have been free and clear. But we
                    gave them our standard ten million year
                    warranty and they have come here to
                    retrieve this back-up copy. And they've
                    brought you with them.

          The transport cart flies out of forest toward the ocean.

                    They brought...I'm sorry, when you say
                    "mice" do you mean the little white furry
                    creatures with the cheese fixation?

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       These creatures you call "mice" are merely
                       the protrusion into our dimension of hyper-
                       intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The
                       whole business with the cheese must've
                       been a front. They were experimenting on
                       you, you see. A vast computer program...

                               ARTHUR
                       Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see
                       -- we were experimenting on them.

101e      Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them.      101e

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Oh, I gather they arranged for you to
                       conduct some primitively staged
                       experiments so they could prod your
                       thinking here and there. But you were
                       actually elements in the computer program.
                       They really are very clever hyper-
                       intelligent pan-dimensional beings.

                       Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans.

101f      They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands       101f
          on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it.

                               ARTHUR
                       So -- you're trying to tell me that mice
                       designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep
                       Thought designed the Earth...which was a
                       giant supercomputer...that you built...to
                       calculate the Ultimate Question. Only,
                       Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the
                       program was completed?

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's bureaucracy for you.

                               ARTHUR
                       Actually, this explains a lot. All my
                       life I've had this strange feeling that
                       something was going on in the world,
                       something big, something sinister ...

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       That's just perfectly normal paranoia.
                       Everyone in the universe has that.

          A & S swoop down and soar over the English countryside --

                      I don't know, perhaps I'm old and tired,
                      but I always think that the chances of
                      finding out what's really going on are so
                      absurdly remote that the only thing to do
                      is say hang the sense of it and keep
                      yourself busy. I'd much rather be happy
                      than right any day.

                              ARTHUR
                      And are you?

         stunned to see...

         HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies
         intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of
         hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his
         house alright.

                      Is this...?

         Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward
         the house.

103a     INT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE/MARK 2 - CONTINUOUS                   103a

         Arthur enters his house. There is no furniture, no
         photographs or books or any evidence of his existence
         there. He feels the walls, the countertops. He's home?

          Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to
          it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip,
          Closes his eyes, enjoying it.

                               ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                       Now that's a cup of tea.

                       We're glad you like it, Earth creature.

          He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a
          silver platter.

                               BENJY MOUSE
                       After ten million years on Earth, and a
                       rather large chunk of that time in
                       England, it would be utterly humiliating
                       if we didn't know how to make a decent pot
                       of tea.

          Arthur stares in shock...can't speak.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse

                       They control a large sector of the

                       Sit, Earthman. Eat.

          Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the
          end slides backward.

                               ARTHUR
                       In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let
                       go of this table.

          Slartibartfast steps forward.

                    Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be
                    getting back to work now.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.

                            ZAPHOD
                       (cracking up, like he's stoned)
                    Smarty fart blast?

                             BENJY/FRANKY
                    Eat!

                             ZAPHOD
                    Right.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    It looks like we won't be needing the new
                    Earth after all, now that we've found the
                    only living native of the planet.

                            SLARTIBARTFAST
                    But...they've nearly finished the oceans.

                            FRAHKY MOUSE
                    That will be all, Slartibartfast.

          Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry, when you say "the only living
                    native" -- do you mean me? What about
                    her?

          Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on
                    the ship. She's half-native. Her real
                    father was a Blahardid, the hyper-
                    intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race
                    native to the planet Olbed, who apparently
                    popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with
                    a one Ms. Francis McMillan.

                            TRILLIAN
                       (looking up, mouth full)
                    Which explains a lot.

          She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in.

                            ARTHUR
                    So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We're sorry to have stage managed you so
                    shamelessly, but once we learned you were
                    the only full-blooded Earthling in the
                    universe, it was important that we get you
                    here by any means necessary.

                    We've spent a considerable amount of time
                    on your planet trying to find this
                    wretched Ultimate Question, and the
                    thought of doing it all over again on
                    account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me
                    to no end. Which is why you're here.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Sit, Earthling. Sit.

          Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him.

                            BENJY/FRANKY
                    NOT THERE!

          Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky
          cover their outburst with a smile.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    This chair is much more -- comfortable.

          Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before
          slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.

                              BENJY MOUSE (CONT'D)
                    Drink.

          He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip.

                              ARTHUR
                    Mmmm.    This really is delicious.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Good. Glad you like it.      Now -- to
                    business.

          Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors.

                            FORD/ZAPHOD
                    To business!

          Benjy and Franky fire them a look.

                              ZAPHOD
                    Sorry.    Thought you were proposing a
                    toast.

                              BENJY/FRANKY
                    EAT!

          Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No
          one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting
          the hill.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    About this Ultimate Question. You see,
                    we've been offered a quite enormously fat
                    contract to do the 5D TV chat show and
                    lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're
                    very much inclined to take it.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    But - and here's the point - we have to
                    have product. Which means we still need
                    an ultimate question.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.

                               FRANKY HOUSE
                    Yes.     Got to sound good.

                            ARTHUR
                    An Ultimate Question that sounds good...
                    From a couple of mice...for a chat show.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    And as it turns out, the chances are
                    astronomically high that the structure of
                    the question is encoded in your brain.
                    Which is why we need it. More tea?

          Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a
          little woozy. Did he hear them right?

                            ARTHUR
                    I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my
                    brain?

                               BENJY MOUSE
                    Yes.     To extract the question.

                            ARTHUR
                    You can't have my brain. I'm using it.

                               FRANKY MOUSE
                    Barely.

                             BENJY MOUSE
                     We can replace it if you think it's
                     important. An electronic brain maybe.

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     A simple one should suffice. Who would
                     know the difference?

                             ARTHUR
                     I would!

                             FRANKY MOUSE
                     No, you wouldn't. We could program you not
                     to.

          Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair
          and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the
          back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.

                               ARTHUR

          They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    What are they-- what's in the food?!
                    WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!?

          The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward
          Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Don't worry. You won't feel a thing.

          The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur.
          Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away.

          Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot
          out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.

                             ARTHUR
                    Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING
                    MINUTE!!

          The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles
          backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop
          eating and listen.

                            ARTHUR (CONT'D)
                    You want the question that goes with the
                    answer "42" How about "What's six times
                    seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take
                    to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one,
                    "How many roads must a man walk down?"

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Hey, that's not bad.

          Through the opposite window (in much the same way
          bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons
          arriving.

                            ARTHUR
                    Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where
                    that came from because my head is filled,
                    with questions, and I can assure you mate,
                    no answer to any of them has ever brought
                    me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes.
                    Indecision? Loads. But happiness...?

          He shakes his head.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    We don't want to be happy.   We want to be
                    rich.

          Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his
          arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the
          platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the
          table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to
          their feet.

                            BENJY MOUSE
                    Shoot him!!

          They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy.

          Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over
          to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg
          of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.

                            FRANKY MOUSE
                    Oh, shit.

          Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat.

          The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze,
          Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

          Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down
          the hill toward the house. He leans over the table,
          bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.

105       ON THE HILL JUST BEYOND --                                   105

          An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it.    Amongst them...

          MARVIN -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.

                            MARVIN
                       (to the Vogon)
                    I must warn you, I'm feeling very
                    depressed.

                            KWALTZ
                    Mr. President!     We are here for your
                    protection!

          Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially.

                            ZAPHOD
                    Thank you!

106       The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the      106
          barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun,
          goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind
          the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his
          head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead?

          BEHIND THE TRUCK --

          FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his
          head emitting smoke.

                         (an idea)
                      Okay -- I'll create a distraction.

         He holds up his towel.

                               ARTHUR
                          (sarcastic)
                      Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.

                               FORD
                          (squinting at Arthur)
                      You know -- I think sometimes you say
                      things that mean something other than what
                      you're actually saying.

         More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's
         twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards...

107      ...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his            107
         towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.

                              FORD (CONT'D)
                      AHHHHHHHH!!!!

         The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.

                              TRILLIAN
                      Now!

108      She and Arthur both run out toward the gun.                     108

                    ARTHUR                        TRILLIAN
         I thought I was...what are       I thought I was...I'll get
         you... get back... okay          it... you already... fine,
         fine...                          fine

         They each grab the gun just as Questular realizes...

                              QUESTULAR
                      It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!!     GET
                      HIM!!

         The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move
         forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward
         Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running
         back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP.
         The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS.

         The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang.       Ford
         looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks
         forward, sees Marvin raising the gun.

                                FORD
                      Duck!

                                ZAPHOD
                      Where?

         He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and
         uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as...

         MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN,

         Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is
         hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.

                           VOGON POLICE FORCE
                      (in unison)
                      Oh what's the point?

         They turn their weapons on themselves and...

         ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning
         their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up.

108a     All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground                108a
         including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing.

         He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his
         head. He drops to his knees.

                              QUESTULAR
                      Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.

         Zaphod takes the gun, fires it at Questular.       He rises --
         and paints on a big smile.

                              QUESTULAR (CONT'D}
                      What am I so pissed off about? I'm great?
                      I'm zarking incredible! Everyone loves
                      me! WHOOO HOOO!!! Look at me...etc.

         Questular runs towards a lake/blow hole, takes off his
         clothes and jumps in.

                                ZAPHOD
                      Marvin.    You saved our lives.

                                MARVIN
                      I know.    Wretched, isn't it?

                              QUESTULAR
                      (distant) Oh man! I love being me!!

         They share a laugh.      Arthur approaches Slartibartfast.

                              ARTHUR
                      Thank you.

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       I've just been informed by some of the
                       lads that since we're so near completion,
                       we're going to go ahead and finish Earth.
                       We can put it back exactly the way it was
                       when you left, you know -- unless there's
                       anything you'd like to change. Something
                       you think your planet could do without?

          Arthur thinks about it...looks around...slowly nods...

                                ARTHUR
                       Yes.   Me.

          He looks to Trillian who raises an eyebrow.    Really?
          She smiles.

                               TRILLIAN
                       Let's go somewhere.

                               ARTHUR
                       Yes, You name it. I'll go.

                               ZAPHOD
                       I'm going to Humma's. He has my head...I
                       think. Doesn't he? I'm so confused.

                               FORD
                       And I'm hungry. After we get your head
                       let's grab a bite. I know this great
                       restaurant at the end of the universe.

          As they walk away, we CUT TO...

109       SLARTI'S FACTORY ELEVATOR -- where they all board.           109

                               SLARTIBARTFAST
                       Okay. Hold tight.

          Everyone grabs the rail, except for Trillian who holds on
          to Arthur. SSSSSSHHHHHHHHHVUMP! Up into the sky they go.

                               VOICE (O.S.)

          We hear KL-KLUNK. BZZZZZZZ... and watch nature burst
          into life - animals run - flowers bloom - waterfalls
          cascade - mountains rise in the mist - monkeys bathe in
          hot springs etc. Set to a wonderful, uplifting piece of
          music ("WHAT A WONDERFUL WORLD?").

          Tilt up to the sky. The day turns to night. Stars appear.
          The Heart of Gold streaks through the stars.

        FADE IN:
                         
          1 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT 1
                         
           Looking incredibly weary, NICK WATERS, 30's, enters his
           apartment in his business suit. He stumbles into --
                         
                         
          2 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 2
                         
           He drops his briefcase, strips off his jacket, loosens
           his tie and collapses onto the bed like a dead man. PAN
           OVER TO the alarm clock which reads "1:23 AM."
                         
           MATCH CUT TO:
                         
                         
          3 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 3
                         
           The alarm clock now reads "4:59 AM." It switches to
           "5:00" and a BLARING BUZZER goes off. Nick sits up in
           bed, shuts off the buzzer and painfully forces himself
           out of bed. He hurries out of the bedroom, passing the
           saddest, deadest houseplant in history.
                         
                         
          4 INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 4
                         
           Nick opens his fridge to reveal a wasteland of moldy
           leftover containers and crusty condiments. The orange
           juice container he grabs is empty.
                         
                          NICK
           Damn.
                         
           He opens the freezer. It contains nothing but multiple
           boxes of "Jimmy Dean's Breakfast Bowl -- with Bacon!" He
           pops one in the microwave, then glances over at a framed
           photo of a slightly younger Nick kissing a smiling OLD
           WOMAN on the cheek. The frame reads: "I Y Grandma!"
           Nick sighs sadly.
                         
                         
          5 INT. NICK'S BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER 5
                         
           Nick sits on the toilet eating his breakfast bowl with a
           fork. He takes some toilet paper from the roll and wipes
           his mouth with it.
                         
                         
          6 INT. NICK'S SHOWER - MOMENTS LATER 6
                         
           Nick showers while simultaneously brushing his teeth and
           shaving. He loses track and brushes his face with the
           toothbrush.
           2.
                         
                         
          7 INT. NICK'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 7
                         
           Nick hastily grabs work clothes from his messy drawers
           and closet. Clearly, no laundry has been done in a
           while.
                         
                         
          8 INT. NICK'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 8
                         
           Nick hurriedly buttons his shirt, tucks it in and begins
           tying his tie as the elevator reaches the lobby.
                         
                         
          9 INT. NICK'S CAR - SHORT TIME LATER 9
                         
           As he drives to work, he dials a number and transfers it
           to speakerphone.

                          NICK
           Yeah, sorry. This is like the
           only time I have to make any
           personal calls. I just wanted to
           see if you felt like going out
           again because I had a great time
           with you on our last date.
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           Our last date was two weeks ago.
           You haven't called me since.
                         
                          NICK
           I know and that's my bad. I've
           been swamped at work --
                         
           JENNA (V.O.)
           Yeah, I remember. Work was all
           you talked about when we went out.
                         
                          NICK
           Right. Well, I'm up for a
           promotion which will give me a lot
           more free time --

           Listen, I'm actually seeing
           someone. And even if I weren't,
           the last thing I need is some
           career-obsessed guy complaining
           about work all the time. See you
           around, Nick.
                         
           She hangs up.

           A soulless four-story building in a drab office park.
           Nick exits his car and runs full-speed to the entrance.

           Nick bursts through the doors and looks at his watch. It
           reads "6:02." He looks up at a security camera with a
           flashing red light, indicating he is on tape.
                         
                          NICK

           Nick sits at his desk inputting information from a large
           PILE of documents into a spreadsheet on his computer.
           The clock on his computer turns to "8:00 AM."

           of the lobby security camera footage on a television.
           The time code at the bottom of the screen reads "6:02."
           We see Nick looking up at the camera and silently
           mouthing the word "Fuck!" The image freezes and we PULL
           BACK to see Harken holding the remote. Nick stands
           across from him.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Here's my concern, Nick. You're a
           punctual guy. You understand the
           importance of getting to work on
           time. So that leaves me to wonder
           if there isn't something wrong
           with the internal clock in our
           security system. What do you
           think?
                         
                          NICK
           I don't know, Mr. Harken. I might
           have been a minute late.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Two minutes according to this. So
           either you're a liar -- which I
           know you're not -- or our system
           is off by a full minute. And if
           that's the case, I have no choice
           but to dismiss Thomas, our
           longtime security coordinator.
                         
                          NICK
           Okay, I might have been two
           minutes late.
                         
           There's an uncomfortable beat. Then --
                         
                          HARKEN
           So you did lie.
                         
                          NICK
           No, I --
                         
           Harken picks up the phone.

           Trust is everything in this

           been working your tail off for
           that promotion, but if I can't
           trust you, how can I make you

           Harken has crossed to a credenza with several bottles of

           tell you, lot of cuties on that

           Thank you. I fingered myself so
           hard to Penn Badgely, I broke a
           nail.
                         
           Dale sighs and looks down at the unconscious Mr.
           Anderton. This obviously isn't the first time Julia has
           spoken this way.

           I'd let that kid put it in my ass.

           sausage under those True
           Religions.

           Oh, right.

           She lifts the patient's limp hand and cups it over her
           breast.

           She smacks the lifeless hand and cackles with laughter.
                         
                          JULIA
           Okay, enough fun. Let's get back

           down Dale's crotch with it.

           (studying his groin)
           I think I can just make out our

           Stacy and I got engaged last
           night.
                         
           Julia's whole demeanor changes. She becomes deadly
           serious.
                         
                          JULIA

           Last quarter's profits? I ran the

           they'll dump our chemicals in
           rivers, pollute water supplies and
           hurt people. I've spent my life
           building this company.

           I've decided to absorb the
           responsibilities of the Senior VP
           position into my own. I realized
           if you want something done right,
           you do it yourself. So, I'm going
           to be knocking down the wall
           between my office and what
           would've been the Senior VP's to
           create a single, enormous office.
           However, as a cost-cutting
           measure, I will only be taking 85%
           of the additional salary I'm
           entitled to. It's called self-
           sacrifice, people. Learn from
           this.

           (loudly, to the room)
           Everyone, can I have your
           attention please? I've just
           learned that Kurt has fired our
           dear friend Hank here. I want you
           to know that I am as surprised and
           angry about this as you are.

           What are you -- ?!
                         
                          PELLIT
           This is entirely an accounting
           department decision. My hands are
           tied.
           (then, to Kurt)
           You are one heartless bastard,
           Gamble.

           the line a bit. But the last

           The other day I imagined shoving
           one of those jugs from the water
           cooler in Harken's mouth and
           making him drink until his bladder
           explodes.

           Well, first of all, killing
           someone is illegal and immoral --
                         
                          KURT
           It may be illegal but I'm not sure
           it's immoral. Sometimes one evil
           person has to die for the greater
           good of the community. If Bobby
           Pellit has his way, hundreds,
           maybe thousands of innocent
           Bolivians will suffer. It would
           actually be immoral not to kill
           him.

           ugly shit and I'm still on

           Most killers are first-timers.
           Look, the key to a good murder is
           making it look like an accident.
           Gas leak, brakes failing, suicide,
           that sort of thing. If you do it
           right, you won't even have to be
           there when it goes down.

           causing him to tumble on top of Nick and Kurt. At last,

           know if Pellit's coming.
                         
                          DALE
           Got it. Wait, I don't know what
           he looks like.
                         
                          NICK
           It doesn't matter. Just tell us
           if anyone comes.
                         
                          DALE
           Got it.
                         
           They take in Pellit's living room. There's a leather
           sofa, a 60-inch plasma and enormous speakers. On the
           wall are framed Ed Hardy posters depicting dragons and
           half-naked girls.

                          NICK
           Okay, let's split up. Look for
           any intel we can use on him.
                         
                          KURT

                          NICK
           I don't know. I guess we'll know
           it when we see it.
                         
           Kurt heads upstairs while Dale and Nick look around the
           living room.
                         
                          DALE
           Hey, Nick? Does this count as
           intel?
                         
           Nick looks over to see Dale holding in his sleeve-covered
           hands an open wooden box filled with white powder.
                         
                          NICK
           Holy shit, that's a lot of blow.

           Suddenly, the box slips out of Dale's hands. It hits the
           floor, sending a cascade of cocaine all over the rug.
                         
                          NICK
           What the fuck?!!

           I've got it.
                         
           He kneels and begins trying to scoop up the coke in his
           hands. It's an impossible task.

           He flips on the light. His eyes land on Pellit's
           toothbrush. He grins slyly.

           Dale is still on his knees, scooping up coke, as Nick
           returns from the kitchen cradling a Dustbuster in his T-
           shirt.
                         
                          NICK
           Look out. Let me try this.
                         
           Struggling with his hands in his T-shirt, Nick vacuums up
           the cocaine from the rug. When he's finished, he pops
           open the vacuum's waste receptacle and dumps the contents
           back in the wooden box.

           Just BELOW FRAME, Kurt removes Pellit's toothbrush from
           his ass and returns it to its holder, careful to keep his
           hands covered with his sleeves.
                         
           He's about to go when he notices a bar of Neutrogena face
           soap beside the sink. He looks around deviously.

           Kurt comes down the stairs.

           a skimpy kimono-style robe. She sits on her bed and
           unwraps a Popsicle.

           Julia opens her front door, stares straight at Kurt and
           beckons him inside with one finger. She walks back
           inside, leaving the door wide open.

           Kurt opens his car door so quickly he tumbles out
           headfirst, planting his face on the street. He jumps up,
           but one ankle is tangled in the seatbelt. He finally
           extricates himself and hurries to the house as fast as he
           can.

           Here's what we do. We call the
           cops and make an anonymous tip
           that Harken killed Pellit. Boom.
           Harken's in jail. Pellit's in
           hell. Julia's had the crazy
           fucked out of her. Our problems
           are solved. Boom.

           Let me ask you something,

           knew who the shooter was and was
           willing to hand you that perp on a
           platter. Would he be entitled to
           some sort of immunity for that
           information?
                         
           Both Dale and Nick shoot daggers at him.

           No. But he would be entitled to
           some sort of jail time. Because
           if he knew who the shooter was and
           didn't tell us, that would be

           I have a better idea. Let's be in

           be so mad, he'll be more likely to

           Right. We'll sit there in the
           dark till he comes in, and then
           switch on a lamp. That'll freak

           My gun. Just give me a second.
                         
           Nick and Dale exchange a look, then quickly rush out of
           the room.

           looking thoroughly freaked out, Nick and Dale push their
           way through the partygoers.
                         
                          NICK
           We had him! We had the whole
           thing. What happened to Kurt?
                         
           Just then, the door to a guest bathroom opens and Kurt
           emerges, buckling his belt and looking strangely red in
           the face.
                         
                          KURT

           Uh, I had to go to the bathroom.
           Bad salmon puff. Are we ready to
           record Harken?
                         
                          NICK
           You're too late, Kurt! He
           confessed the whole damn thing!
                         
                          DALE
           More than once! Then he told us
           we were dead men! He's getting
           his gun right now!
                         
                          KURT

           Suddenly, the bathroom door opens again and out steps
           Mrs. Harken, also looking disheveled. She adjusts her
           dress then rejoins the party.

           Overcome with rage, Nick PUNCHES Kurt in the arm then
           rushes to the door. Dale and Kurt hurry after him.

           Nick sits steaming mad as Kurt drives. Dan fiddles with
           the tape recorder in the back.
                         
                          KURT
           Look, I wasn't thinking. She's so
           hot and I'm so weak. I'm a weak,
           weak man. I admit it.
                         
           From the back seat, we hear from the tape recorder:
                         
           KURT (V.O.)

           I know. That makes it even
           hotter.
                         
           We hear unbuckling and unzipping.
                         
           MRS. HARKEN (V.O.)
           Your balls are so smooth.

           A short distance behind a car is following Kurt's. As it
           comes closer we see it's a Porsche. And it's driven by a
           determined-looking Harken.

           From the guys' POV we see an unmarked car and a police
           squad car parked outside of Kurt's place. Hagan and
           Samson stand with two UNIFORMED OFFICERS.

           Kurt and Nick exchange a baffled look.
                         
                          JULIA
           See you Friday, you dirty bird.
                         
           Julia hangs up. Dale looks like he's been violated.
                         
                          DALE
           Nice job `fucking the crazy out of
           her,' Kurt!
                         
                          KURT
           Maybe I should've spit on her
           arms.
                         
           ON STAR REP (V.O.)
           Good evening, Mr. Gamble.
                         
           The three of them JUMP, startled by the sudden voice in
           the car with them.
                         
                          KURT

           This is Gregory, your On Star rep.
           Our on-board sensors report that
           you have a damaged tail light.
                         
                          KURT
           Yeah, thanks, Gregory, we know.
           We're being chased by a crazy man
           and he just smashed into us!
                         
           Kurt looks in the rearview mirror and sees Harken is
           still behind them. As his car reaches an intersection,
           Kurt swerves at the last second and takes a hard left.
           Harken overshoots the turn.
                         
           ON STAR REP (V.O.)

           Suddenly, Kurt's engine dies and the car comes to a
           gradual stop.
                         
                          NICK

           There's a sound of screeching tires and Harken's Porsche
           ZOOMS up behind them.
                         
                          NICK

           Harken's car PLOWS into the rear of Kurt's, forcing it
           into the back of a parked car. Even if the engine was
           working, there'd be nowhere to go now.
                         
           Dazed from the impact, the guys look back to see Harken
           slowly approaching on foot, holding a gun in his hand.

           Kurt lowers the window.

           The three guys nervously exit the car and face Harken who
           points the gun at them.

           No. I have a better idea.
                         
           Harken turns the gun toward his own thigh and FIRES.
                         
                          HARKEN

           As his leg bleeds, Harken wipes the gun off with his
           shirt, then suddenly tosses it to Dale.

           Startled, Dale catches the pistol with shaking hands.

           Now I can tell the cops that when
           I discovered you three killed
           Pellit, you tried to kill me to
           shut me up.

           Down the street, two squad cars turn the corner and speed
           toward them. Dale looks down at the gun in his hand and
           drops it.
                         
                          HARKEN
           Is it? Because I don't see a
           shred of evidence proving that I
           killed Pellit. It's like I've
           always told you, Nick. Life is a
           marathon and you can't win a
           marathon without putting a few
           Band-Aids on your nipples.
                         
           Nick deflates. The three guys realize Harken's won.
           Then, from the car's open window they hear:
                         
           ON STAR REP (V.O.)

           And with that, Harken BOLTS AWAY as fast as his injured
           leg will take him. It's not very fast. The guys watch
           him for a beat as they share a joyful, exhausted moment
           together.

           Nick sprints off after his hobbling boss and in SLOW
           MOTION, violently TACKLES Harken to the pavement. Harken
           goes down hard, his face SLAMMING against the asphalt.
                         
           As the COPS hurry toward them, Nick kneels on the back of
           Harken's neck, pinning him.

           off.

           I'm aware that I have a weight
           problem, Kurt. It just happens to
           manifest itself in my lower
           abdomen.
                         
                          KURT
           I... oh, my God. I'm really
           sorry, Margie --
                         
           He falls silent under Margie's death stare.
                         
                          MARGIE
                          (COLDLY)
           Kurt, I know you were a favorite
           of Jack's. He was willing to
           overlook your inappropriate
           behavior with female clients and
           service people. But you should be
           aware, I'm not Jack. And I have
           very little tolerance for the
           mistreatment of women. So
           consider this your first strike.
                         
                          KURT
           How was I supposed to know you
           were just fat --
                         
                          MARGIE
           Strike two.
                         
           Kurt opens his mouth to say something but thinks better
           of it. He stands up and slumps out. Life as he knew it
           at Pellit Chemicals is clearly over.
                         
                         
          138 INT. DENTAL EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 138
                         
           Julia enters to find Dale waiting for her. A PATIENT
           lies asleep in the chair, his face obscured by the
           nitrous mask.
                         
                          JULIA
           Thank God it's Friday, right,

           Let's drill this patient and then
           you can drill me.

           Could we do it on top of the
           patient? I like the element of
           danger.
                         
                          JULIA
                          (IMPRESSED)
           You continue to surprise me, you
           weird little man.
                         
           Julia quickly undoes the patient's belt and yanks his
           pants down.
                         
                          JULIA

                          DALE
           Oh, yeah.
                         
           Julia begins handling the patient's implied genitals
           which are obscured by a tray of tools.
                         
                          JULIA
           (in a puppet voice)

           could have sex with Julia.'
                         
           Suddenly, the patient bursts out LAUGHING and sits up.
                         
                          JULIA
           What the hell?!
                         
           The patient pulls off his nitrous mask to reveal it's
           KENNY, the guys' former classmate from the bar.
                         
                          KENNY

           Kenny will do just about anything
           for fifty bucks and that's why I
           hired him to help me frame you.

           Dale points to the window where Julia sees COCKSUCKER
           JONES outside holding up a video camera. He waves to
           her.

           Shut up, Julia. Now, my fiancee
           and I are going to take a very
           expensive two week vacation which
           you're going to pay for. And then
           I'm going to come back to a rape-
           free workplace. Because if you so
           much as look at my ass, I'll have
           yours locked up.
                         
           With a bounce in his step, Dale strides out of the room.
           There's an awkward beat with Kenny and Julia.
                         
                          KENNY

                          NICK
           Okay. I was hoping to give them
           to the marketing guys today, but I
           can hold them off.

           In the future, it'd be great if

           Carter's eyes narrow. All at once, he rushes at Nick,
           grabs him by the throat and HURLS him THROUGH THE PLATE
           GLASS WINDOW, shattering it.

           Nick smiles and closes the door behind Carter. He
           settles into his comfy chair and puts his feet up on the
           desk.

                                           1971

                

               THE HOSPITAL. DAY. MAY,

               PANORAMIC VIEW of The Hospital -- a vast medical complex, a 
               sprawling pastiche of architecture extending ten blocks north 
               and south on First Avenue and east to the river.

               The Hospital was founded in the late 19th century, and there 
               are still a few begrimed Victorian Bedlams and Bastilles 
               among the buildings. Mostly though, it is Medical Modern 
               1971, white and chrome and lots of glass and concrete shafts 
               and rotundas. A spanking new Community Mental Health Clinic 
               towers among the tenements at the northern end of the complex. 
               On the far side of First Avenue, a twenty-story apartment 
               house with recessed balconies and picture windows to house 
               the resident staff has just recently been completed, and 
               next to it, eight ghetto buildings are being demolished to 
               make way -- according to the construction company's sign -- 
               for a new Drug Rehabilitation Center, to be completed in 
               1973, we should all live so long. This is where the shattering 
               SOUNDS OF CONSTRUCTION are coming from. A block length of 
               generators and cement and demolition machines are POUNDING, 
               CRASHING, SCREAMING. Traffic HONKS and BRAYS up First Avenue.

               It is a cold spring morning -- 10:00 A.M.

               A 1966 station wagon pulls up to the Holly Pavilion.

               A tiny, fragile, white-bearded OLD MAN, almost lost in his 
               overcoat, is helped from the rear of a station wagon and 
               slowly led to the entrance doors by a middle-aged nurse.

                                     NARRATOR
                         On Monday morning, a patient named 
                         Guernsey, male, middle-seventies was 
                         admitted to the hospital complaining 
                         of chest pains.

               HOLLY PAVILION. EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

               The old man is now in a wheelchair pushed by a hospital 
               orderly down the corridor.

                                     NARRATOR
                         He had been referred by a nursing 
                         home where the doctor had diagnosed 
                         his condition as angina pectoris. 
                         Now it is axiomatic that nursing 
                         home doctors are always wrong.

               ROOM 806

               The old man, shirtless, is propped on the edge of the bed, 
               wheezing. DR. SCHAEFER, a young intern in white-uniform, 
               perches beside him with the old man's chart in his lap, taking 
               down his history. The other patient in the two-bedded room, 
               a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, is comatose and all rigged up with I.V.'s 
               and catheters.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The intern who admitted Mr. Guernsey, 
                         however, accepted the diagnosis and 
                         prescribed morphine, a drug suitable 
                         for angina but not at all suitable 
                         for emphysema, which is, 
                         unfortunately, what the old man 
                         actually had. Within an hour...

               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

               Two orderlies rush the old man's bed with, of course, the 
               old man in it, past the Nurses' Station and into a waiting 
               elevator.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...the patient became unresponsive 
                         and diaphoretic and was raced up to 
                         Intensive Care with an irregular 
                         pulse of 150, blood pressure 90 over 
                         60, respiration rapid and shallow.

               INTENSIVE CARE

               An oxygen mask is applied to the old man's face by the 
               resident.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The resident on duty now compounded 
                         the blunder by treating the old man 
                         for pulmonary edema. He gave him 
                         digitalis, diuretics and oxygen. 
                         This restored the old man's color...

               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

               The elevator door opens. Two orderlies wheel the sleeping 
               man on his bed back around the Nurses' Station and down the 
               corridor to his room.

                         ...and he was sent back to his room 
                         in the Holly Pavilion, ruddy 
                         complected and peacefully asleep.

               ROOM 806. EVENING

               The old man is back in his room sleeping serenely, his tiny 
               body making barely a ripple in the white sheet that covers 
               him. The room is in hushed shadows. A yellowish light diffuses 
               into the room from the half-opened bathroom door. The other 
               patient in the room remains as before, comatose and silent.

                         In point of fact, the patient was in 
                         CO2 narcosis...

               ROOM 806

               All the lights are on now. NURSE PENNY CANDUSO and an orderly 
               are wrapping the old man in a post-mortem shroud. BRUBAKER, 
               the senior resident, is giving hell to Schaefer, the intern.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...and died at seven-thirty that 
                         evening.

               The shrouded body of the old man is wheeled out of the room. 
               CAMERA STAYS on the vacated bed.

                                     NARRATOR
                         I mention all this, only to explain 
                         how the bed in Room 806 became 
                         available.

               PAN from bed to Schaefer, now alone in the room and regarding 
               the empty bed with frowning interest. Schaefer is a scraggly 
               young fellow, bespectacled, with a contemporary mess of hair 
               and a swinging unkempt moustachio. HOLD on Schaefer.

                                     NARRATOR
                         The intern involved was a prickly 
                         young buck named Schaefer who had a 
                         good thing going for him with a 
                         technician in the hematology lab. In 
                         the haphazard fashion of hospital 
                         romances, Dr. Schaefer had been 
                         zapping this girl on wheelchairs, 
                         stretchers, pantry shelves...

               Dr. Schaefer moves for the phone on the table between the 
               two beds.

                         ...in the kitchen, in the morgue, in 
                         the dark corners of corridors...

               Schaefer speaks softly into the phone.

                                     NARRATOR
                         ...standing up, sitting down -- so 
                         you can imagine what an available 
                         bed meant to him.

                                     SCHAEFER
                              (on phone)
                         Hey, Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. 
                         Hey listen. I got us a bed for 
                         tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.

               CREDITS AND MUSIC ERUPT ONTO THE SCREEN --

               INTERSPERSED WITH CREDITS, the following scenes:

               ROOM 806. NIGHT

               Dark. Just a bit of moonlight streaking through the not quite 
               closed bathroom. The hallway door opens, and a young woman, 
               carrying a top coat, slips quickly in giggling like hell, 
               followed by Schaefer, who is likewise giggling and admonishing 
               her to be quiet. Her name is SHEILA. Sheila notices the other 
               patient in the room sleeping away and looks questioningly at 
               Schaefer, who reassures her as he removes her coat. After 
               which he strips off his own white jacket and trousers and 
               hangs them in the armoire. The girl asks in a hoarse whisper 
               if they're going to get totally nude and wonders if that's 
               such a good idea. For an answer, Schaefer fondles her crotch. 
               They both giggle, they both shush each other, they giggle 
               again; they're both stoned. The girl unzippers her dress. 
               The dark room is filled for the moment with the flurry of 
               undressing, flung garments, elbows, legs and arms, bumpings 
               into each other, and Sheila saying between giggles, "Boy, I 
               sure hope nobody walks in."

               They eventually wind up on the unoccupied bed, and the scene 
               ends looking ACROSS the sleeping profile of THE PATIENT in 
               the other bed as Schaefer and his girl thump away at each 
               other with much creaking of springs, moans, groans, giggles 
               and the white-limbed patterns of fornication.

               ROOM 806

               Dark, silent, hushed. The fun and games are over. Sheila is 
               in front of the armoire. She slips back into her dress, after 
               which she tiptoes back to the bed where Schaefer is deeply 
               asleep, smiling in postcoital peace. Sheila bends, shakes 
               his shoulder.

                                     SHEILA
                              (whispers)
                         I'll see you.

               Schaefer smiles, grunts, sleeps on.

               END OF CREDITS.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

               FADE IN:

               THE HOSPITAL. 6:30 A.M. NEXT MORNING, TUESDAY

               A cold newly-dawned sun shines down on the vast sprawling 
               complex of the hospital. Desultory early morning traffic on 
               First Avenue.

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR

               The night shift of nurses is closing out another night's 
               work, which has been on the whole uneventful. The head nurse, 
               MRS. REARDON, hunches over her paperwork. NURSE ELIZABETH 
               RIVERS sits at the desk beside her, resting her head on the 
               palm of one hand. NURSE'S AID J.C. MILLER crosses with an 
               armful of linens. She disappears into the pharmacy and supply 
               areas behind the Nurses' Station. In the west corridor, NURSE 
               LUCINDA PEREZ glances at her watch, then pads down to Room 
               806. She enters.

               ROOM 806. DAY

               A cold gray light cheerlessly illuminates the room. Nurse 
               Perez checks the I.V. on the comatose patient who is in the 
               bed nearest the door. Then she turns to regard the other bed -- 
               which gives her pause.

               NURSE'S P.O.V.: Intern Dr. Schaefer is lying on this bed, 
               rigid, eyes dilated, pupils staring unseeing. An I.V. tube 
               sticks out of his naked right arm. Nurse Perez doesn't quite 
               know what to make of the fact that Dr. Schaefer is lying on 
               that bed with an I.V. tube sticking out of him looking dead. 
               Frowning, she reaches out a tentative hand to shake his naked 
               shoulder.

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         Doctor Schaefer...

               There is, of course, no response. A terrible suspicion enters 
               Nurse Perez's mind, and she closes her eyes and sighs a long 
               shuddering sigh. Then she opens her eyes and, with a second 
               and briefer sigh, reaches for Schaefer's neck to take his 
               pulse. Clearly, the result is not encouraging. She sighs 
               another short sigh and regards Schaefer's unblinking, dilated 
               pupils. It's all a bit too much for her; she shuffles to the 
               window and stares out into the gray morning where things are 
               a little more comprehensible. Once again, she returns to the 
               bed, regards Schaefer's death mask. She raises the bedsheet 
               and, for one short but appreciative moment, considers 
               Schaefer's naked body. She lets the bedsheet carefully down. 
               She sighs again.

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                              (trying again, with 
                              little hope)
                         Doctor Schaefer?

               She sighs, turns and leaves the room.

               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

               Nurse Perez, frowning and pursing her lips, moves slowly 
               back to...

               EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION

               Head Nurse Reardon is still bent over her paperwork.

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         Listen, did you know Doctor Schaefer 
                         was in Eight-O-Six, because he's 
                         dead?

                                     MRS. REARDON
                              (late forties, 
                              continues her 
                              painstaking paperwork, 
                              grunts)
                         What?

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         I'm just telling you, Dr. Schaefer 
                         is dead.

                                     MRS. REARDON
                              (works on; after a 
                              moment, looks up)
                         What do you want, Perez?

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         Look, I don't know what the hell 
                         this is all about, but Dr. Schaefer 
                         is in Room 806 with an I.V. running 
                         and he's dead. I didn't even know he 
                         was sick.

                                     MRS. REARDON
                              (regards Perez a moment)
                         Perez, what the hell are you talking 
                         about?
                              (appeals to Nurse 
                              Rivers coming out of 
                              the floor pharmacy)
                         Do you know what the hell she's 
                         talking about?

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         Well, maybe I'm going crazy. I don't 
                         know. Isn't Room 806 the patient 
                         Guernsey? I mean, did something happen 
                         I don't know about?

                                     MRS. REARDON
                         Perez, I don't know what you're 
                         talking about.

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         This is the nuttiest thing I ever 
                         saw. Dr. Schaefer's in Room 806 dead.

                                     MRS. REARDON
                         What Dr. Schaefer? Our Dr. Schaefer?

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         Our Dr. Schaefer. The one who's always 
                         grabbing everybody's ass.

                                     MRS. REARDON
                              (to Nurse Rivers)
                         Do you know what she's talking about? 
                         I don't know what she's talking about.
                              (to Perez)
                         What do you mean Doctor Schaefer's 
                         in Room 806 dead?

                                     NURSE PEREZ
                         I mean, he's lying on the far bed, 
                         stone dead, and with an I.V. tube 
                         sticking out of him. And if you don't 
                         believe me, maybe you just ought to 
                         get up and look for yourself.

               With a short, irritable sigh, Mrs. Reardon abandons her 
               paperwork and heads down the west corridor, followed by Nurses 
               Perez and Rivers. CAMERA TRACKS as Mrs. Reardon turns to 
               Nurse Rivers.

                                     MRS. REARDON
                         All right, maybe you'd better call 
                         Mrs. Christie.

               Phone RINGS.

               BOCK'S HOTEL ROOM

               Dark. Venetian blinds drawn. TV set on, a gray coarse-grained 
               square. PHONE RINGS.

               DR. HERBERT BOCK, 53 years old, a large man, bulky, 
               disheveled, apparently fell asleep in a chair while watching 
               television the night before. The bed still has its spread on 
               but is rumpled. Bock is in trousers and shirt, collar opened, 
               barefooted. PHONE RINGS. The reading lamp is the only light 
               in the room except for the sheen of gray hissing from the 
               television. Newspapers litter the floor. Books, two-day-old 
               plates of food, yesterday's mugs of coffee, cigar-stuffed 
               ashtrays, a shirt, a pair of pants, a winter overcoat, a 
               battered gray fedora have been slung about. PHONE on the 
               bedtable RINGS again, begins to penetrate the sotted sleep 
               of the man. Two bottles of booze, one empty, and a clump of 
               glasses are on the coffee table in front of Bock. He grunts, 
               opens an eye. PHONE RINGS. Bock suddenly exsufflates in a 
               snorting grunt. He stands, shuffles to the bed, a big, sodden 
               fellow, picks up the receiver, interrupting its next RING. 
               He sinks, sitting on the bed.

                                     BOCK
                         This is Dr. Bock... Yes, Mrs. 
                         Christie, what is it? It's all right, 
                         I'd be getting up in a few minutes 
                         anyway... I'm sorry I missed that. 
                         Would you say it again? Yes, I know 
                         him, Schaefer, the stud with the 
                         glasses, who fancies the nurses... 
                         I'm afraid I don't understand that, 
                         what do you mean? Was he sick? I 
                         mean, was he... uh, what was the 
                         cause of death? Was he being treated? 
                         I don't understand. What was he doing 
                         in the bed? You did say he... Look, 
                         Mrs. Christie, did you call the 
                         office? Good, well, I'll... No, no, 
                         it's all right. I'll be getting my 
                         wake-up call any minute anyway.

               He returns the receiver to its cradle, sits disoriented, 
               unbuttoning his shirt.

               HOSPITAL. MORNING. 8:00 A.M.

               LONG SHOT of the hospital, now alive and jumping. Taxis pull 
               up and out of the large U-shaped drive. A noisy picket line 
               of about twenty chanting protesters parade with signs in an 
               uneven ellipse.

                                     GRUMBLING PROTESTERS
                              (chanting)
                         Two-four! Help the poor!

               Most of the placards are slogan-y: "PEOPLE YES! DOCTORS NO!" -- 
               "CURE POVERTY! HEAL THE POOR!" Two protesters move toward 
               the street, waving and yelling at an approaching car. One, a 
               young white fellow wears a sandwich board that goes into the 
               matter at some length: "WE PROTEST THE EVICTION OF 386 BLACK 
               FAMILIES AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THEIR HOMES TO SERVE THE 
               EXPANSIONIST POLICIES OF THIS IMPERIALIST HOSPITAL."

               In the back seat of the car sits JOHN SUNDSTROM, handsomely 
               graying, tanned, early fifties, the Director of the Hospital. 
               He looks up. That young demonstrator, DR. IVES, a sandy-haired 
               bespectacled man of 30 in a white doctor's coat, sidles to 
               the car's open rear window angrily shouting.

                                     DR. IVES
                         What do you say, Sundstrom? How much 
                         longer do you think our monopolistic, 
                         exclusionary, racist policies will 
                         work?

                                     PROTESTER
                         We're the hope!

               Sundstrom lowers his window and gives his driver directions. 
               He exits in the BACKGROUND parking area, where he notices 
               Bock emerging from his car. Sundstrom waits for him.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         So how's it going, Herb?

               Bock's sour glance says it all. He locks his car, joins 
               Sundstrom, and the two men start down the concrete ramp.

                                     BOCK
                              (after a moment)
                         One of my interns dropped dead this 
                         morning.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Really? I'm sorry to hear that. I 
                         understand you've moved out to a 
                         hotel.

                                     BOCK
                         Yes.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         It got that bad with Phyllis?

                                     BOCK
                         It's been that bad for twenty-four 
                         years. Are you going to be solicitous?

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Yes.

                                     BOCK
                         Oh, God.

               They trudge across the U-shaped entrance drive, pausing to 
               let a car pass.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Listen, Herb, I'm the guy who brought 
                         you into this hospital, so I think I 
                         can skip the diplomatic overtures. 
                         Marty stopped me in the hall 
                         yesterday, very upset. He had just 
                         had lunch with you and said you 
                         sounded suicidal. Marty tends to be 
                         extravagant, but he's not the only 
                         one. Jack Singer mentioned the other 
                         day you've been boozing it up a lot. 
                         And let's face it, you've been 
                         sloughing off. I understand you 
                         haven't even been doing rounds.

                                     BOCK
                         I'm going to do rounds today.

               They pick their way around the shuffling line of protesters -- 
               many with Afro haircuts and tinted glasses, including a black 
               minister and four young white activists.

               HOSPITAL, HOLLY PAVILION, EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

               Early-arriving secretaries chat in the doorways. The corridor 
               itself connects to the Bryce Pavilion (pediatrics, gynecology 
               and obstetrics), so a steady stream of traffic moves back 
               and forth. Bock and Sundstrom enter the corridor and slow to 
               a halt to continue their chat by a wall.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Herb, want a couple of days off?

                                     BOCK
                         No.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Go down to Montego Bay, get drunk, 
                         get laid, get a little sun.

                                     BOCK
                         For God's sake, John, I'm fifty-three 
                         years old with all the attendant 
                         fears. I just left my wife after 
                         twenty-four years. Standard case of 
                         menopausal melancholy.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Maybe you ought to have a talk with 
                         Joe Einhorn.

                                     BOCK
                         I don't want to see a psychiatrist. 
                         Stop worrying about me. All I have 
                         to do is get my ass back to work, 
                         and I'll be fine. I'm sorry I've 
                         caused you concern.

               He sets off down the long corridor to the elevators. MILTON 
               MEAD, the Administrator of the Hospital, comes out of one of 
               the offices, waves a good morning to Bock, who acknowledges 
               him and plods on. Mead comes up to Sundstrom, now moving 
               toward his own office.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         Sid just called from St. Luke's, and 
                         he's heard that the demonstrators up 
                         there are planning a march to join 
                         the bunch down here.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Oh, God.
                              (he wraps his arm 
                              around Mead's 
                              shoulders, ushering 
                              him into his office 
                              area)
                         Did you call the cops?

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         Yes.

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR. 8:15 A.M.

               The elevator door opens. Out comes Bock, overcoat unbuttoned 
               now. He clumps to the Nurses' Station. An unusual number of 
               nurses seems to be there. Through the doorway of the floor 
               pharmacy, we can see Nurse Rivers of the night shift being 
               comforted by Nurse Perez of the night shift and Nurse Edwards 
               of the morning shift. The head morning nurse, MRS. DONOVAN, 
               is at the desk hunched over her paperwork. (Nurses are always 
               hunched over their paperwork.) NURSE FELICIA CHILE is also 
               seated at the desk doing some paperwork. Head Nurse Donovan 
               looks up briefly as Dr. Bock approaches.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                              (back to her paperwork)
                         They're all in Eight-O-Six, Doctor.

                                     BOCK
                         What happened?

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         I think I'll just let Mrs. Christie 
                         tell you about it.

               Bock lumbers off for the west corridor through a press of 
               activity. Kitchen workers trundle creaking portable carts, 
               nurse's aids and attendants pop in and out of doorways bearing 
               trays and used dishes. A robed patient or two ambulates along 
               the hall. Morning rounds have just started, which means a 
               clump of white-jacketed, white-trousered young doctors are 
               gathered in a gaggle at the far end. The group includes senior 
               resident MONROE BRUBAKER, junior resident HARVEY BIEGELMAN, 
               interns SAM CHANDLER and IRVING AMBLER and another medical 
               student, all lounging outside a door discussing the condition 
               of the patient within.

               Chandler is presenting the case from a handful of notecards 
               in his hand. The others lean against the walls, listening. 
               They wear shirts and ties with the exception of Ambler, who 
               is new to the floor and still in the canonical white tunic 
               under his jacket. They are all in their twenties and have 
               swinger sideburns and occasional mustaches. When he spots 
               Dr. Bock, senior resident Brubaker turns the rounds over to 
               Biegelman and joins Bock just outside 806.

                                     BRUBAKER
                              (as he approaches, 
                              rolls his eyes)
                         Oh boy.

                                     BOCK
                         What happened?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         I've seen some pretty good snafus, 
                         but this one... I mean, there's a 
                         certain splendor to this one. One of 
                         the night nurses, a float, thought 
                         Schaefer was a patient and plugged 
                         an I.V. into him. He was a diabetic, 
                         you know.

                                     BOCK
                         What do you mean, a nurse plugged an 
                         I.V. into him?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Oh, it's really a screwed-up story, 
                         Doctor. You see, what happened was 
                         we had an old man in that bed who 
                         died last night, so the bed was 
                         available. And you know Schaefer. 
                         He's Sammy Stud.

                                     BOCK
                         And he talked a nurse into zapping 
                         him on that bed.

                                     BRUBAKER
                         I think it was a girl from hematology 
                         he's been running with.

                                     BOCK
                         My God, it's a Roman farce.

               The door to Room 806 opens, and an Assistant Administrator 
               named HITCHCOCK pokes his head out.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         I thought I heard you out here, 
                         Doctor.
                              (he too rolls his 
                              eyes heavenward in 
                              an expression of 
                              incredulity)

               Bock makes a noise and goes into...

               ROOM 806

               Aside from Hitchcock, the room includes MRS. CHRISTIE, the 
               Director of Nurses, a fusty forty-six, in streetclothes; 
               Head Night Nurse, Mrs. Reardon, in uniform; Head Evening 
               Nurse, MRS. DUNNE, mid-fifties, who had apparently been called 
               in from home because she's in mufti and wearing a winter 
               coat; and, of course, the comatose patient and the dead Dr. 
               Schaefer. Mrs. Christie is instructing the two nurses.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         I'll need one from both of you, three 
                         copies, and I suggest you do that 
                         right now. The forms are in my 
                         office...

               Mrs. Dunne, on the verge of tears, head bobbing, looks up to 
               Bock.

                                     MRS. DUNNE
                         I'm really so terribly sorry about 
                         this, Dr. Bock. I...

                                     BOCK
                              (regarding Schaefer's 
                              rigid death mask)
                         As I understand it, one of the nurses 
                         inadvertently administered an I.V. 
                         to Schaefer here. How the hell could 
                         that happen?

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Listen, I think we ought to straighten 
                         this out somewhere else.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Yes, very good idea. Oh God, what a 
                         mess.

               They all file out now, Bock in the rear into...

               HALLWAY, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA

               They all go along to the Nurses' Station where Mrs. Reardon 
               and Mrs. Dunne disappear into the rooms behind. Mrs. Christie 
               leads Hitchcock and the trailing Bock to the TV-solarium; 
               but Dr. Brubaker is now holding his rounds there. He stands, 
               quietly expounding on the uses of heparin, a decoagulant. 
               One of the patients last night had hemorrhaged consequent to 
               injudicious use of that drug. Listening, the other young 
               doctors make notes. Mrs. Christie leans against the wall. 
               Apparently, the conference is to take place in the corridor. 
               Background activity continues normally.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                              (with a sigh)
                         Well, these things happen, of course.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         I suppose I'd better call the Medical 
                         Examiner.

                                     BOCK
                         I still don't know what happened.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Well, it took an hour to get it sorted 
                         out. It seems a patient named Guernsey 
                         died last night in Eight-O-Six, but 
                         that information wasn't given to the 
                         night nurses. These things happen.

               Bock has begun to get the drift. A curious state of apathy 
               settles over him.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                              (rattling on)
                         At any rate, according to the cardex, 
                         the patient Guernsey was down for 
                         twenty-five milligrams of Sparine Q-
                         6-H, so Mrs. Reardon sent Nurse Perez 
                         to give him his twelve o'clock shot. 
                         Meanwhile, it seems Dr. Schaefer had 
                         usurped that particular bed for his 
                         own purposes. Dr. Brubaker suggests 
                         it was for a love tryst, and some 
                         weight is given that hypothesis by 
                         the fact that Dr. Schaefer was naked.

                                     BOCK
                              (trying to give his 
                              attention to this)
                         I get the drift, Mrs. Christie. In 
                         other words, Nurse Perez went in and 
                         sedated Dr. Schaefer thinking it was 
                         the patient Guernsey. My God! What I 
                         don't understand...

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         If I may finish, Doctor. Well, after 
                         Perez gave him his shot, she noticed 
                         the I.V. on the bed had been pinched 
                         off, and she reported that back to 
                         Mrs. Reardon, who then assigned Nurse 
                         Rivers to restart the I.V.
                              (Bock sighs)
                         Now Rivers was a float. She didn't 
                         even know the staff people on the 
                         floor, and nobody knew what the 
                         patient Guernsey looked like anyway, 
                         since he'd only been admitted that 
                         morning.

                                     BOCK
                         So she plugged an I.V. into him.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Yes.

                                     BOCK
                         How much?

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         A liter.

                              (The doctor in him

                         A five percent glucose solution won't

                         ancillary conditions? He wasn't 
                         dehydrated, was he? Didn't anybody 
                         bother to go in to check him during 
                         the night, even under the impression 
                         he was merely a patient? Was he 
                         hyperasthmolic? Did he have a bad 
                         heart? He must have had some kind of 
                         thrombosis. I want the post done 
                         here, Mr. Hitchcock. And you and I 
                         better have a little chat, Mrs. 
                         Christie, about your excessive use 
                         of float nurses.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         I've got nearly a thousand nurses in 
                         this hospital.

                                     BOCK
                              (gathering rage)
                         And every time one of them has her 
                         period, she disappears for three 
                         days. My doctors complain regularly 
                         they can't find the same nurse on 
                         the same floor two days in a row. 
                         What the hell am I supposed to tell 
                         that boy Schaefer's parents? That a 
                         substitute nurse assassinated him, 
                         because she couldn't tell the doctors 
                         from the patients on the floor? My 
                         God, the incompetence here is 
                         absolutely radiant! I mean, two 
                         separate nurses walk into a room, 
                         stick needles into a man -- and one 
                         of those was a number eighteen jelco! -- 
                         tourniquet the poor sonofabitch, 
                         anchor the poor sonofabitch's arm 
                         with adhesive tape, and it's the 
                         wrong poor sonofabitch! I mean, my 
                         God! Where do you train your nurses, 
                         Mrs. Christie? Dachau!?
                              (he is aware his voice 
                              has risen and is 
                              attracting attention. 
                              He lowers his voice)
                         All right, wrap him up and get him 
                         down to Pathology. I'm especially 
                         interested in his blood sugar. A 
                         liter of glucose never killed anybody. 
                         Your ladies must've done something 
                         else to him.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Will there be anything else, Doctor?

                                     BOCK
                         No.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Before you call the family, Doctor, 
                         I wish you'd talk to Mr. Mead about 
                         this. We'd like, naturally, to avoid 
                         litigation.

               Bock heads abruptly down the corridor to the elevators.

               HOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR

               A corridor of offices. This is the Department of Medicine, 
               where Bock and all the senior staff members of the department 
               have their offices. It's quiet, since most of the staff are 
               away at their various specialties about the hospital.

               Bock comes up the corridor still wearing the overcoat he 
               arrived in some hours ago. He has only managed to unbutton 
               it in all the time it has taken him to reach the corner 
               office. Gilt lettering on the door reads: DEPARTMENT OF 
               MEDICINE and below that DR. HERBERT E. BOCK.

               BOCK'S OFFICE, OUTER OFFICE

               Small office with two desks. As Department Chief, Bock gets 
               two secretaries. Both are at their desks, one on the phone, 
               MISS GLORIA LEBOW, and the other rattling away on the IBM, 
               MISS STEPHANIE McGUIRE.

                                     MISS LEBOW
                              (mouthing)
                         Coffee?

               It would seem not. Bock waves a listless hand, exits into...

               BOCK'S PRIVATE OFFICE

               The modestly imposing office is lined with medical tomes. 
               Bock slips out of his coat and jacket and hangs them in the 
               closet. In shirtsleeves with his tie a bit askew -- 
               fastidiousness in dress is not Bock's strong point -- he 
               crosses to his desk and sits, breathing more heavily than 
               his small exertions would seem to warrant. He seems exhausted. 
               There is a KNOCK on the door. Miss Lebow enters, holding a 
               filing envelope stuffed with papers.

                                     MISS LEBOW
                         A few things have been piling up. 
                         Would you like to go into them?

               A guttural noise indicates yes. Miss Lebow pulls up a chair, 
               opens her folder.

                                     MISS LEBOW
                         A quickie. Dr. Esterhazy wants to 
                         start hiring temporary people to 
                         cover the summer vacations. He says 
                         last year some of the replacement 
                         people didn't receive their checks 
                         until they waited six months. He 
                         wonders if you could do something 
                         about getting these people paid more 
                         promptly.

               She places a sheet of paper on the desk in front of Bock. He 
               tries to give his attention to it.

                                     MISS LEBOW
                              (drones on)
                         Miss Aronovici complains the lab 
                         reports are coming in slow into the 
                         E.R. I called Dr. Immelman about 
                         that, and she said three microscopes 
                         have been stolen out of her lab in 
                         the last two months. Charley Waters 
                         also complains about pilferage. I've 
                         clumped all those together for you...
                              (she lays a sheaf of 
                              memos in front of 
                              Bock, who stares at 
                              them blankly)
                         Now, as you know, Doctor, we've agreed 
                         to take over the local ambulance 
                         cases as part of the hospital's 
                         commitment to the community, and 
                         it's created a serious overload in 
                         the E.R. I don't know why this was 
                         dumped in our lap, but...

               Bock obviously isn't up to all this. He waves a limp hand to 
               stop Miss Lebow's morning report.

                                     BOCK
                              (staring at his desktop)

                         office yet.

                                     MISS LEBOW
                         Which Dr. Einhorn? Ophthalmology or 
                         Psychiatry?

                         Never mind. I'll look in myself.

               He lumbers across the room and out into...

               BOCK'S OUTER OFFICE

               ...and down past Miss McGuire, rattling away on her IBM, and 
               out into...

               HOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR

               ...down past several closed doors, stopping at a door marked 
               DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, DR. JOSEPH EINHORN. He enters.

               DR. EINHORN'S OFFICE, SECRETARY'S OFFICE

               A secretary at her desk, sips coffee and reads a paperback 
               novel.

                                     BOCK
                         Is he in?

               The doctor is obviously in. He can be seen through the open 
               door sitting at his desk writing in a notebook. Bock leans 
               in.

                                     BOCK
                         Can you give me a few minutes, Joe?

                                     EINHORN

                              bespectacled, late 
                              fifties)
                         Of course.

               Bock goes in, closes the door behind himself.

                              (ill at ease)
                         I've been having periods of acute 
                         depression recently. Apparently, 
                         it's becoming noticeable. A number 
                         of people have remarked on it. Anyway, 
                         John Sundstrom thought it might be a 
                         good idea if I spoke to you about 
                         it.

                         No. I'm not good at confessional.

                         Well, what can I tell you? The last 
                         year, two, three... it goes way back, 
                         I suppose. I can remember entertaining 
                         suicidal thoughts as a college 
                         student. At any rate, I've always 
                         found life demanding. I'm an only 
                         child of lower-middle-class people. 
                         I was the glory of my parents. My 
                         son the doctor. Well, you know. I 
                         was always top of my class. 
                         Scholarship to Harvard. The boy 
                         genius, the brilliant eccentric. 
                         Terrified of women, clumsy at sports. 
                         God, Joe, how the hell do I go about 
                         this?

                         your wife.

                         I left her a dozen times. She left 
                         me a dozen times. We stayed together 
                         through a process of attrition. 
                         Obviously sado-masochistic dependency. 
                         My home is hell. We've got a twenty-
                         three-year-old boy I threw out of 
                         the house last year. A shaggy-haired 
                         Maoist. I don't know where he is, 
                         presumably building bombs in basements 
                         as an expression of his universal 
                         brotherhood. I've got a seventeen-
                         year-old daughter who's had two 
                         abortions in two years and got 
                         arrested last week at a rock festival 
                         for pushing drugs. They let her off. 
                         The typical affluent American family. 
                         I don't mean to be facile about this.

               Indeed, he does not. He is horrified by the fact his eyes 
               are wet and he is verging on tears. He turns away quickly.

                         I blame myself for those two useless 
                         young people. I never exercised 
                         parental authority. I'm no good at 
                         that. Oh, God, I'm no good at this 
                         either. Joe, let's just forget the 
                         whole thing. I'm sorry I bothered 
                         you.

                         and stupid. All I have to do is pull 
                         myself together and get back into my

                         care of yourself. I'll see you.

               Before Einhorn can say a word, he slips away and disappears 
               into his own office.

               HOLLY PAVILION. 8:30 A.M.

               The score of protesters outside the pavilion still move in 
               an uneven ellipse and shout: "Two -- Four! Help the Poor!" 
               Ives, the bespectacled demonstrator who shouted at Sundstrom 
               earlier, is removing his sandwich boards and giving them to 
               his replacement. He hurries across the walk and into...

               HOLLY PAVILION, LOBBY

               Ives cuts through the congestion of people and moves swiftly 
               up the long corridor leading to the Farkis Building, 
               unbuttoning his overcoat as he goes into...

               THE FARKIS BUILDING, FIFTH FLOOR

               ...and comes out, as the elevator opens. This is a laboratory 
               floor, and the corridors are empty except for a white-
               uniformed orderly leaning against a wall and for one young 
               woman in a white smock in the background, who waves to the 
               young man before disappearing into one of the rooms. Ives 
               fishes out a ring of keys and unlocks the door to his own 
               lab. He enters into...

               FARKIS BUILDING, NEPHROLOGY LAB

               Dingy and cheerless place, as labs go. Ives hangs his coat 
               in the cupboard, loosens his tie, unbuttons his suit jacket, 
               squats on a stool, reaches over for a loose file on the work 
               table, opens the file and begins to read the papers inside.

               A door CLICKS open behind him, and without looking up, he 
               waves briefly to whoever has entered. CAMERA DOLLIES to FULL 
               SHOT of Ives frowning over his notes. We are suddenly 
               conscious of a white-uniformed presence behind him. We know 
               it's medical personnel, but we can't see the face. Ives starts 
               to turn to the presence behind him, when suddenly a small 
               hospital sandbag is whipped down on his head, and he slumps 
               forward, his forehead thumping against the black surface of 
               the lab table.

               HIGH ANGLE SHOT establishing the passing of hours. Sun high 
               overhead, traffic on First Avenue an impenetrable river of 
               HONKS and HOOTS. At a crosswalk, a loose procession of fifty 
               or so shouting demonstrators, bearing placards, flows toward 
               the main gates. Their posters read: "FIGHT DOPE -- NOT DOPES!" 
               "DRUGS YES! TRANSPLANTS NO!" and "SAVE OUR KIDS FROM THE 
               SKIDS!" which is what they now chant: "Save our kids! From 
               the Skids!" The demonstration moves through a handful of 
               city cops where our original group of twenty still ramble 
               around, chanting: "Two -- Four! Help the Poor!"

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR

               The staff elevator doors open and Bock comes out, wearing 
               his long white doctor's coat unbuttoned. Hanging about the 
               Nurses' Station are Dr. Brubaker and a few young men in white. 
               They come quickly to respectful attention at Bock's entrance. 
               CLATTERING TRAYS dominate the lunchtime atmosphere.

                         Yes, sir.

               The doctors move off toward the solarium on the east corridor 
               overlooking the river. They pass a curious quartet of people 
               consisting of a very handsome YOUNG WOMAN in her late twenties 
               in an out-of-fashion miniskirt (She has great legs, long and 
               tanned.); an ELDERLY MAN, uncomfortable in city clothes and 
               unmistakably an INDIAN; a tall overcoated man in his forties 
               wearing a MINISTER's white collar; and a DISTINGUISHED MAN 
               dressed in fashionable gray who is trying to persuade the 
               young woman of something. The young woman and the Indian 
               stand absolutely still, silent, impassive. The minister is 
               more fidgety.

                         Eight-O-Six.

               Bock and Brubaker, trailed by young doctors, move into the 
               TV room.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, TV ROOM

               Some twenty-five or thirty young doctors, two or three of 
               them black, three or four of them women, fill the room. At 
               Bock's entrance, they find places around the walls, sofas, 
               soft chairs and benches. The TV set has been pushed into a 
               corner, and a large portable blackboard has been set up. 
               This is the Chief of Service Round, attended by every 
               available intern and resident. Somebody closes the door, 
               just as two young doctors come hurrying in.

               People of all ages sit around on aluminum chairs arranged 
               around the walls of the room. All are in streetclothes. Some 
               speak to each other. A line of people, extending into the 
               hallway and holding their charts, waits for a lady from the 
               accounting department taking Blue Cross numbers. This lady 
               from accounting is MRS. CUSHING, late forties, bespectacled 
               and testy. She calls out at large.

                         Give me that one again... thirty-
                         two?

               Facing the desk are six curtained treatment rooms, mostly 
               open to view. Behind the desk are a supply room and another 
               treatment room. Both are occupied, the former by a PARANOID 
               LADY wringing her hands in a paranoid rush and listened to 
               by a very patient young intern.

                                     PARANOID LADY
                         They follow me everywhere. Three big 
                         black men. Naked, completely exposed. 
                         Right in the street. Hanging down to 
                         their knees. Disgusting. They're 
                         waiting out there for me now...

               ...and in the other room, a man in his thirties is being 
               treated for some sort of head lacerations. In one treatment 
               room, the Chief of Emergency Service, DR. SPEZIO, a man in 
               his late thirties, along with an intern, an anesthesiologist 
               and a nurse, is bent over a naked and comatose young black 
               woman of eighteen, covered somewhat with a sheet. She's a 
               junkie, being intubated, i.e. a small endotracheal tube has 
               been inserted into her mouth. This is the most melodramatic 
               of the varied activity here.

               A middle-aged man complaining of chest pains is lying clothed 
               in another treatment room; a nurse attends him.

               An asthmatic middle-aged woman sits in still another room 
               being administered her 500 mg. of amenophylene subcutaneously.

               The curtains on another room are drawn for privacy. On chairs 
               in the corner sit a teenage boy with a badly sprained ankle 
               and an elderly man bathing his hand in an enamel basin held 
               in his lap.

               A young mother with a five-year-old daughter with a badly 
               cut arm is being attended to by the back wall. The Emergency 
               Room Nursing Supervisor, MISS ARONOVICI, a pretty woman in 
               her mid-twenties, is sterilizing the little girl's wound.

               Mrs. Cushing makes her way to Miss Aronovici. They detest 
               each other.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Did you call upstairs and tell them 
                         to admit a patient named Mitgang?

                                     MRS. ARONOVICI
                              (continuing to treat 
                              the little girl)
                         The concussion?

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         I don't know. They just called me. 
                         They said you didn't fill out the 
                         chart. And where do you come off 
                         sending anyone up to Admitting without 
                         my okay?

               Miss Aronovici turns to Mrs. Cushing, regarding her sweetly.

                                     MRS. ARONOVICI
                         Sally, would you get the fuck out of 
                         here. The patient's in the Holding 
                         Room. You want his Blue Cross number, 
                         you go in and you get his Blue Cross 
                         number.

               Mrs. Cushing elbows back through the line of patients waiting 
               at the Admitting desk.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Do you mind, please...

               There are now three nurses behind the desk, all of them on 
               phones. One nurse calls to Dr. Spezio.

                                     NURSE
                         O.P.D. wants to know how that 
                         asthmatic they sent down is.

                                     DR. SPEZIO
                              (just leaving the 
                              group around the 
                              junkie)
                         She's fine. We'd like to keep her 
                         here a little while.

               Spezio heads for the door where he is intercepted by Mrs. 
               Cushing.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         May I see you a moment, Doctor, if 
                         you don't mind.

                                     DR. SPEZIO
                              (sighs, calls back to 
                              the triage nurse)
                         I'll be right back.

               He goes out, followed by Mrs. Cushing, into...

               EMERGENCY AREA, LOBBY

               Spezio and Mrs. Cushing move between laundry and supply carts.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                              (thrusting some papers 
                              at the doctor)
                         If you don't mind, Doctor, is this 
                         your handwriting?

               Spezio stops, sighs, examines the paper.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Am I supposed to read that? Was it a 
                         sprain? Was it a broken wrist? I 
                         can't read that scribbling. I mean, 
                         I have to bill these people. I know 
                         you doctors are the ministering 
                         angels, and I'm just the bitch from 
                         the Accounting Department, but I 
                         have my job to do too. I mean, if 
                         you don't mind, Doctor...?

                                     DR. SPEZIO
                              (studies the paper)
                         The kid had a collar fracture. We 
                         had him in the O.R. We reduced it 
                         and we gave him a small cast.

               He strides off.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                              (calls after him)
                         But did you give him a sling? You 
                         must have taken X-rays. How am I 
                         supposed to make up the charges?

               She turns into...

               EMERGENCY AREA, HOLDING ROOM

               Designed to hold patients who've been examined and wait to 
               be admitted to a room upstairs, it's in fact used for 
               examination, treatment, storage. The room is quiet. Two male 
               patients lie on comfortable stretchers, apparently sedated 
               and resting. Mrs. Cushing turns to the patient immediately 
               to her right as she enters. To the still figure she poses 
               her questions.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Are you Mitgang?

               She gets no answer from that bed. From another direction, a 
               voice.

                                     MITGANG
                         I'm Mitgang.

               She turns to Mitgang. Something bothers her about the first 
               patient. She finds Mitgang's chart tucked in under his pillow, 
               takes out her pencil.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Do you carry Blue Cross, Blue Shield, 
                         Mr. Mitgang, if you don't mind?

               Mitgang, eyes closed, emits a sound.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Do you have your card with you?
                              (no answer)
                         Do you know your number?

               Negative grunt from Mitgang.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Mr. Mitgang, you're not leaving this 
                         room until I have this information.

                                     NURSE
                              (enters for some chore)
                         Will you leave that man alone?

               In a fit of temper, Mrs. Cushing throws the chart and her 
               pencil down on the floor.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                              (indicating the other 
                              patient)
                         Do you mind if I at least ask this 
                         gentleman to fill out his chart?

               She pulls his chart from under his pillow, bends and retrieves 
               her pencil from the floor, straightens. She speaks to the 
               silent patient.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         May I have your A.H.S. policy number, 
                         sir?

               No answer. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN on the patient. We now 
               recognize him as the bespectacled young activist Dr. Ives, 
               so recently coshed over the head with a sandbag.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                              (looming)
                         Do you carry Blue Cross? Blue Shield?

               Mrs. Cushing stares at the patient. He is not breathing. 
               Behind her, the nurse exits carrying whatever she came for. 
               Mrs. Cushing turns to her, but she is gone. Frowning, Mrs. 
               Cushing backs out...

               ...as Dr. Spezio and others come down the corridor.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                              (as Spezio approaches, 
                              with spiteful relish)
                         I think one of your patients in here 
                         is dead, Dr. Spezio.

                                     DR. SPEZIO
                              (enters the Holding 
                              Room)
                         Why do you say that, Mrs. Cushing?

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Because he wouldn't give me his Blue 
                         Cross number, Dr. Spezio.

               HOLDING ROOM

               Spezio regards the death mask of a face.

                                     DR. SPEZIO
                         Oh, Christ.

               He moves quickly forward to raise the dead man's eyelid. 
               Behind him, a nurse enters. He wheels on her angrily.

                                     DR. SPEZIO
                         How the hell long has this man been 
                         lying here? Isn't this that doctor 
                         who came in around nine o'clock?

               MILTON MEAD'S OFFICE. 2:00 P.M.

               MILTON MEAD, late thirties, lean, efficient but under constant 
               strain, is having his daily staff luncheon conference, which 
               consists of a CHIEF ENGINEER, the ASSISTANT ADMINISTRATOR OF 
               PERSONNEL, three residents in administration, including 
               Hitchcock, sandwiches and coffee.

                                     CHIEF ENGINEER
                         I mean, they gave me a hard time, 
                         Con Ed. "For Pete's Sake," I said, 
                         "this is a hospital. One of our 
                         feedlines just blew..."

               Mead's phone RINGS and he picks it up.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         Yeah?
                              (it's another 
                              annoyance; he sighs 
                              with irritation)

                                     CHIEF ENGINEER
                         I mean, it's lucky we traced it in 
                         time.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (on phone)
                         No, I'll be right up.
                              (hangs up, stands)
                         Have we covered about everything?

                                     ADMINISTRATIVE RESIDENT
                         Dr. Kish has been driving me nuts 
                         with the O.R. schedule.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         He's supposed to see me about that.

               He moves across his office into...

               MEAD'S SECRETARY'S OFFICE

               Actually a communal office with desks for three secretaries.

                                     MEAD'S SECRETARY
                              (looks up to Mead 
                              from talking on the 
                              phone)
                         This is the Emergency Room. One of 
                         the doctors just died of a heart 
                         attack.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (pauses)
                         One of our staff?

                                     MEAD'S SECRETARY
                         I think so.

               Mead frowns, leans back into his own office.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (to Hitchcock)
                         Tom, you want to go down to the 
                         Emergency Room? One of our doctors 
                         just died.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         What? Another one?

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         Yeah, see what that's about.
                              (en passant to 
                              secretary)
                         I'll be on Holly Eight. I'll be right 
                         back.

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR

               The staff elevator door opens, and Milton Mead comes out. He 
               has apparently been buttonholed in the elevator by a woman 
               in a doctor's coat, DR. IMMELMAN, Pathology, who follows him 
               out...

                                     DR. IMMELMEN
                         It's no longer pilferage, Milton. 
                         It's reached the point of piracy. 
                         That's the third microscope this 
                         month.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         Why don't we get together on this 
                         sometime this afternoon, Fran?

                                     DR. IMMELMAN
                         One o'clock?

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         One o'clock will be fine.

               He turns left and heads for...

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION

               ...where Head Nurse Donovan is bent over her paperwork. In 
               the background, we see normal morning hospital activity. 
               Nurse's Aid, SHARLENE STONE, takes towels into a room. R.N. 
               Felicia Chile comes out of another, bearing her enamel tray 
               of instruments.

               Also in the background, the curious quartet from before -- 
               the beautiful woman, the elderly Indian, the minister, Dr. 
               Sutcliffe. Mead hardly notices them as he makes for the desk.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                              (without pausing or 
                              looking up)
                         Your brother's in the room, Mr. Mead.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         What room is it?

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         Eight-O-Six.

               Mead bobs his head thank you and heads for the west corridor.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, ROOM

               As Milton Mead enters, his elder brother, WILLIAM MEAD, mid-
               forties, a smaller and manifestly nervous man, is seated 
               sullenly puffing a cigar, fidgeting, still wearing his coat 
               and hat. He looks up briefly when Milton enters and avoids 
               his brother's eye. His wife, MARILYN, late thirties, is 
               standing in suppressed exasperation, staring out the window. 
               Out of respect for the COMATOSE PATIENT, the ensuing agitated 
               scene is held in whispers.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         For heaven's sake, Willie, you're 
                         going to be in the hospital for two 
                         lousy days. What're you making such 
                         a fuss about?

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         You're supposed to be such a big 
                         wheel here.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         There are no private rooms available. 
                         If they brought in Jesus Christ fresh 
                         off the cross, I couldn't get Him a 
                         private room.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         I'm not going to stay in a room with 
                         a dying man...

                                     MARILYN MEAD
                         He's not dying. They'll screen him 
                         off. You won't even know he's here.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         If you want a private room, go on 
                         home, and I'll call you the first 
                         one that comes up. But you're the 
                         one who phoned me in a panic, you're 
                         going on a vacation. For heaven's 
                         sake, Willie, they'll cut this polyp 
                         out tomorrow morning. You'll be home 
                         Thursday, you'll be in Miami Friday. 
                         Marilyn, will you talk some sense 
                         into this lunatic?

                                     MARILYN MEAD
                         Well, you said it, he's a lunatic.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         Big wheel, can't even get me a private 
                         room.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         I'll get you a tranquilizer...

               He exits.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, TV ROOM

               Bock -- excited, vivid, alive -- is in full flush with his 
               lecture. He moves around in front of the blackboard, chalk 
               in hand. The blackboard itself is scrawled with formulae and 
               diagrams. He is writing the words "full abdomen," as the 
               fifth in a list reading "(1) parexia, (2) hepatomegaly, (3) 
               splenomegaly, (4) episodes of arthralgia." The audience is 
               forty young doctors rapt with attention. There is a good 
               deal of note-taking.

                                     BOCK
                         ...five, a full abdomen contrasted 
                         to wasting elsewhere; six, ascites 
                         with a protein content above four 
                         grams; unexplained anemia, leukopenia, 
                         unexplained elevation of the serum 
                         gamma globulin level, especially 
                         abnormal flocculation tests, and of 
                         course, a positive P.P.D. All these 
                         findings assume special significance 
                         among Negroes. This has been a very 
                         commendable workup, as commendable a 
                         workup of an F.U.O. as I can remember. 
                         The staff of this floor is to be 
                         applauded.
                              (spots Brubaker among 
                              the others)
                         It's a reportable case, Brubaker. 
                         Write it up.
                              (a brief, rare smile)
                         Well, let's go have a look at the 
                         girl.

               He rumbles toward the door. The class of doctors dissolves 
               into hospital murmurs and mutters and a general dispersal. 
               They follow Bock out to...

               EIGHTH FLOOR, EAST CORRIDOR

               ...where Dr. Sutfcliffe, the beautiful young woman, the 
               elderly Indian and the minister are engaged in agitated 
               discussion. The girl and the Indian retain their stoic 
               impassivity. Dr. Sutcliffe leaves them and moves down the 
               corridor to the counter of...

               EIGHTH FLOOR NURSES' STATION

                                     SUTCLIFFE
                         Nurse! Nurse, who's the Senior 
                         Resident on this floor?

                                     NURSE
                         That would be Dr. Brubaker. But I'm 
                         afraid he's at Chief of Service rounds 
                         right now.

               Sutcliffe points off right.

                                     SUTCLIFFE
                         That's... this way?

               The nurse nods indifferently.

               ACROSS to Bock coming out of the TV room, followed by some 
               dozen young doctors. Bock is in very good spirits indeed. He 
               quizzes his young doctors en route:

                                     BOCK
                         I wonder if there might not be some 
                         correlation between hepatic 
                         tuberculosis and drug addiction. 
                         Presumably, there was an early 
                         consideration of S.B.E.

                                     BRUBAKER
                              (off-screen)
                         Yes, sir. We discounted it after 
                         repeated blood cultures were negative.

                                     BOCK
                         You, Ambler. Is that right, Ambler?

                                     AMBLER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     BOCK
                         What else do you look for in bacterial 
                         endocarditis?

                                     AMBLER
                              (nervous)
                         Some sort of embolic phenomena, sir.

                                     BOCK
                         Good.

                                     SUTCLIFFE
                              (flagging Brubaker)
                         Dr. Brubaker, I wonder if I could 
                         see you for a moment?

               Brubaker detaches himself from his group to join Sutcliffe. 
               CAMERA STAYS with Bock and his entourage, following them 
               down the east corridor, Bock still happily conducting class. 
               Bock strides into...

               ROOM 819

               Past two beds, they group around the foot of a third bed on 
               the right side of the room. Bock checks the patient lying in 
               the bed.

                                     BOCK
                         Still a little icteric. Who's got an 
                         opthalmoscope?

               One of the young men hands his to Bock, who leans over the 
               patient to look through it.

                                     BOCK
                         Did anyone note Roth spots?

               The doctors exchange a look as Bock rises, moves toward them, 
               laughing.

                                     BOCK
                         Well, don't worry about it. There 
                         aren't any. Ambler, you're our big 
                         man on S.B.E. What was the latex-
                         fixation?

                                     BIEGELMAN
                         It wasn't done, sir.

                                     BOCK
                         Don't you think that's an important 
                         test to differentiate S.B.E. from 
                         miliary T.B.?

                                     BIEGELMAN
                              (off-screen)
                         No, s...

                                     BOCK
                         Not you, Biegelman. Ambler.

                                     AMBLER
                         Well, there's about a seventy percent 
                         incidence of false-positive latex in 
                         S.B.E.

               Bock hands the opthalmoscope to Ambler.

                                     BOCK
                         You have been reading up. If the 
                         diagnosis were S.B.E., would a 
                         positive latex indicate anything in 
                         the therapy?

                                     AMBLER
                         We'd expect the latex to become 
                         negative.

                                     BOCK
                         If...?

                                     AMBLER
                         If the antibiotic therapy were 
                         successful.

                                     BOCK
                         Are you applying for your internship 
                         here?

                                     AMBLER
                         I'm not sure.

                                     BOCK
                         Come and see me.
                              (to the patient, 
                              helping her up)
                         Would you sit up for a minute?

               Bock turns to the off-screen patient, helping her sit up and 
               forward, percussing her back as the students look on.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, EAST CORRIDOR

               Brubaker and Sutcliffe are now both involved in discussion 
               with the woman, the Indian and the minister, as Bock drifts 
               through the background, followed by the band of young doctors 
               now dispersing. Bock crosses past the foreground group to 
               the staff elevator. He pushes the button. Brubaker approaches 
               Bock. They confer quietly in the hallway.

                                     BRUBAKER
                         We've got a little thing over here, 
                         Doctor. The girl over there is the 
                         daughter of the patient in Eight-O-
                         Six. He is at the moment comatose 
                         and requires intravenous feeding and 
                         meds.

               The elevator comes and goes, disgorging some, taking on 
               others. Bock, who greeted Brubaker with a rare, benign smile, 
               has begun to look a bit sodden. Poor Brubaker, aware of the 
               gathering storm in Bock's demeanor, sighs and continues 
               regardless.

                                     BRUBAKER
                         The thing is, the daughter wants to 
                         take the father out of the hospital 
                         and back to Mexico where they live. 
                         The patient's name is Drummond. He's 
                         apparently a Methodist missionary, 
                         and he and his daughter run some 
                         kind of religious mission among the 
                         Apache Indians. The daughter claims 
                         to be a licensed nurse, so she can 
                         give the necessary I.V. treatment. I 
                         certainly don't think he should be 
                         let out of this hospital. The 
                         Attending -- he's the guy in gray 
                         over there -- concurs.

               Bock squints at Brubaker.

                                     BOCK
                         All right, wait a minute. Let me 
                         have all that again.

                                     BRUBAKER
                         As a matter of fact, Doctor, this is 
                         Dr. Biegelman's case.

                                     BOCK
                         Never mind the professional ethics, 
                         what happened?

                                     BRUBAKER
                              (sighs)
                         I don't know why I'm covering for 
                         that sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion 
                         anyway.
                              (sighs and begins)
                         The patient, a man of fifty-six, was 
                         admitted to the hospital ten days 
                         ago for a check-up, in good health, 
                         no visible distress. We did the 
                         mandatory work-up on him. Blood 
                         cultures, stool, L.E. preps, chest, 
                         E.K.G., all negative. But there was 
                         apparently some evidence of protein 
                         in his urine. I don't know how that 
                         sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion ever 
                         found out about it. Maybe he had 
                         some kind of deal with one of the 
                         girls in the lab. Anyway, he turned 
                         up the next day, conned the patient 
                         into signing an authorization for a 
                         biopsy...

                                     BOCK
                         What sonofabitch in Farkis Pavilion?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Some post-grad fellow named Ives. 
                         Elroy Ives. I never met him. He's on 
                         one of the immunology research 
                         programs.

                                     BOCK
                         Are you trying to tell me some post-
                         grad fellow came up here and did a 
                         biopsy on the patient?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Yes, sir. He conned Biegelman with 
                         that old story about...

                                     BOCK
                         ...protein in the urine?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Yes, sir.

                                     BOCK
                         And he biopsied the man?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         And he nicked a vessel, and at two 
                         o'clock in the morning, they woke up 
                         Biegelman because the nurse found 
                         the patient in shock. Biegelman called 
                         the kidney people for a consult right 
                         away. What was there to see? The man 
                         was sour and bleeding. We spoke to 
                         this fellow Sutcliffe, and he referred 
                         us to a surgeon named Welbeck...

                                     BOCK
                         Welbeck?! That barber!

                                     BRUBAKER
                         You ain't heard nothing yet. So we 
                         finally got Welbeck around four in 
                         the morning. He said, go ahead. So 
                         they laid on the surgery for eight. 
                         Welbeck turns up, half-stoned, orders 
                         an I.V.P., clears him for allergies...

                                     BOCK
                         ...without actually testing.

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Right.

                                     BOCK
                         And the patient went into shock...

                                     BRUBAKER
                         ...and tubular necrosis. They lopped 
                         out the bleeding kidney, ran him 
                         back to the room, and we sat around 
                         waiting for three days to see how 
                         obstructed he was. Fever began spiking 
                         like hell, euremia, vomiting, so we 
                         arranged hemodialysis. He's putting 
                         out good water now. But some nurse 
                         goofed on his last treatment. A leak 
                         in the tube, something. His blood 
                         pressure plunged. They ran him right 
                         up to I.C.U., checked out vital signs, 
                         all normal except he's comatose. 
                         That was two days ago.

                                     BOCK
                         In short, a man came into this 
                         hospital in perfectly good health, 
                         and, in the space of one week, we 
                         chopped out one kidney, damaged the 
                         other, reduced him to coma and damn 
                         near killed him.

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Yes, sir.

               A great sad serenity has settled over Bock.

                                     BOCK
                         You know, Brubaker, last night I sat 
                         in my hotel room, reviewing the 
                         shambles of my life and contemplating 
                         suicide. Then I said "No, Bock, don't 
                         do it. You're a doctor, a healer. 
                         You're the Chief of Medicine at one 
                         of the great hospitals of the world. 
                         You're a necessary person. Your life 
                         is meaningful." Then I came in this 
                         morning and find out one of my doctors 
                         was killed by a couple of nurses who 
                         mistook him for a patient because he 
                         screwed a technician from the 
                         nephrology lab...

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Hematology, sir.

                                     BOCK
                         And now you come to me with this 
                         gothic horror story in which the 
                         entire machinery of modern medicine 
                         has apparently conspired to destroy 
                         one lousy patient. How am I to sustain 
                         my feeling of meaningfulness in the 
                         face of this? You know, Brubaker, if 
                         there was an oven around, I'd stick 
                         my head in it. What was the name of 
                         that sonofabitch from Farkis Pavilion 
                         again?

                                     BRUBAKER
                         Ives, sir. Elroy Ives. Somebody ought 
                         to ream his ass.

               The gathering storm erupts. Rage suffuses Bock's face. Out 
               of respect for the hospital corridor and the people working 
               around him and Brubaker, he keeps it glacial. But there is 
               no mistaking the volcanic fury he feels.

                                     BOCK
                              (barely containing 
                              himself)
                         I'm going to ream his ass. And I'm 
                         going to break that barber Welbeck's 
                         back. I'm going to defrock those two 
                         cannibals. They won't practice in my 
                         hospital, I'll tell you that!

                                     BRUBAKER
                         What'll I tell the girl, sir? She 
                         says we have no legal right to stop 
                         her from taking her father out. She's 
                         willing to sign an A.O.R. form.

                                     BOCK
                         Let him go. Before we kill him.

               The elevator door opens. A couple of nurses come out. Bock 
               strides in.

               SEVENTH FLOOR, DEPT. OF MEDICINE CORRIDOR

               Bock advances in a cold fury down to his office. He wrenches 
               the door open.

               BOCK'S OFFICE, OUTER OFFICE

               Miss Lebow and Miss McGuire clatter away at typewriters. 
               Sitting on a chair in the crowded office is a senior staff 
               doctor, a man in his late forties, wearing a coat similar to 
               Bock's. He is DR. LAGERMAN. He looks up from the magazine 
               he's been leafing through as Bock storms in.

                                     DR. LAGERMAN
                         Hi, Herb...

               Bock acknowledges him with a brusque nod, storms over to 
               Miss Lebow.

                                     BOCK
                         Get me Dr. Gilley. Put him on page 
                         if you have to. I want to talk to 
                         him right now. I don't care if he's 
                         operating.
                              (wheels around to 
                              Miss McGuire)
                         And you get me some monkey named 
                         Ives. Ives. I-V-E-S, first name Elroy. 
                         He's in the Farkis Pavilion.

                         I want to talk to you, Joe. Would 
                         you mind coming into my office?

               He strides, followed by Dr. Lagerman, into...

               BOCK'S PRIVATE OFFICE

               ...and slams the door shut behind him.

                         kind of a dialysis room you're 
                         running. I just came from...

               The phone RINGS. Bock seizes it.

                         ago you were going to cut off all 
                         privileges for that assassin, Welbeck? 
                         Yeah. Wellbeck. He just butchered 
                         another one of my patients... Oh,

                         here!
                              (slams receiver down, 
                              stares at Lagerman)
                         Listen, Joe, I think you should know 
                         that you've got a research guy in 
                         your department named Ives who's 
                         been doing some very dubious biopsies. 
                         We're having enough trouble squeezing 
                         grants out of the Nixon 
                         administration...

                                     DR. LAGERMAN
                         Ives is dead, Herb. That's why I'm 
                         here.

               This gives Bock pause. He blinks at Lagerman.

                                     BOCK
                         What do you mean, Ives is dead?

                                     DR. LAGERMAN
                         I mean he's dead. He had a heart 
                         attack in the Emergency Room.

                                     BOCK
                         He had a heart attack in the Emergency 
                         Room?

                                     DR. LAGERMAN
                         Yeah.

                                     BOCK
                              (blinking)
                         What the hell is this? Some kind of 
                         plague?
                              (stands)
                         Where is he now?

                                     DR. LAGERMAN
                         They were just taking him down to 
                         Pathology.

               HOLLY PAVILION, FIRST FLOOR, PATHOLOGY DEPT

               Bock, Lagerman and Hitchcock have gathered across the shrouded 
               figure of Dr. Ives on a stretcher. We are in the lab section 
               of Pathology; in the background, through the glass part of 
               the door separating the lab from the surgery room, we can 
               see the autopsy on Dr. Schaefer being performed.

               Schaefer's naked white cadaver is stretched out on an 
               operating table. He has been opened up and all his vital 
               organs are being excised. It's bloody. The autopsy is being 
               performed by DR. BREWSTER, the Resident in Pathology, dressed 
               in surgical scrub.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         ...and the next thing anybody knew, 
                         about three hours later, Mrs. Cushing 
                         from Accounting came in and said 
                         there was a dead man in the Holding 
                         Room.

                                     BOCK
                         You don't find anything grotesque 
                         about all this?

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         What do you mean?

                                     BOCK
                         I mean, at half past eight this 
                         morning, we meet over a doctor who's 
                         been killed intravenously, and here 
                         we are again, four hours later, with 
                         another doctor who had a heart attack 
                         in the Emergency Room.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Well, what're you suggesting Doctor? 
                         Do you think we have a mad killer 
                         stalking the halls of the hospital? 
                         Presumably, Dr. Ives died of a heart 
                         attack and Schaefer in a diabetic 
                         coma. People do die of these things. 
                         It's all perhaps coincidental, but I 
                         don't think I'd call it grotesque.

                                     BOCK
                         How long are they going to be on 
                         Schaefer's post?

               He knocks on the glass window of the door separating the 
               laboratory from the operating room. Dr. Brewster turns from 
               his gory chore. Bock makes a gesture saying, "How much 
               longer?" Brewster raises ten blood-drenched rubber-gloved 
               fingers. Bock turns and shuffles across the lab for the door 
               out.

                                     BOCK
                              (pauses at door, to 
                              Lagerman)
                         I don't suppose you'd like to call 
                         next of kin?

                                     DR. LAGERMAN
                         No thanks.

                                     BOCK
                              (deeply depressed)
                         Oh God, I need a drink.

               He goes down...

               THE PATHOLOGY CORRIDOR

               ...and is soon lost in the normal traffic of the area.

               THE HOSPITAL. NIGHT

               CRASH of THUNDER. CRACKLE of LIGHTNING. A horror-film 
               rainstorm lashes the vast dark complex of buildings.

               SEVENTH FLOOR, DEPT. OF MEDICINE CORRIDOR

               Dark, empty, silent. One lonely light at the lobby end of 
               the long, closed corridor of offices. The door to Bock's 
               office stands ajar and issues a trace of light.

               BOCK'S OFFICE

               ACROSS the silent, dark, typewriter-covered desks of the two 
               secretaries through the doorway to Bock's private office, we 
               can see Bock at his desk, lit by the desk lamp. He has a 
               bottle of booze on his desk. He gets up from his desk. He 
               has made a decision.

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR

               The corridors are silent; the night lights are on, subdued. 
               Head Evening Nurse Mrs. Dunne is back at her desk, hunched 
               over paperwork. Resident Brubaker passes by.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, PHARMACY

               Nurse SHERLEE DEVINE, a black woman in her mid-twenties, has 
               a porcelain tray on the shelf onto which she puts a small 
               jar of alcohol, cotton swabs, a wrapped hypodermic needle 
               and syringe. She moves out into...

               NURSES' STATION

               ...where Mrs. Dunne looks up as she passes.

                                     NURSE DEVINE
                         Mead.

               Mrs. Dunne nods. Nurse Devine makes her way silently down 
               the sleeping doors to...

               ROOM 806

               Dark, sleeping. The bathroom light is on, but only a thin 
               stream of yellow light trickles through the door. THUNDER 
               CRASHES. William Mead sleeps fitfully. The other patient is 
               entirely curtained off. Nurse Devine sets her tray on Mead's 
               bedtable, turns on the goose-neck lamp, keeping it from his 
               eyes. She unwraps the hypodermic syringe, sets in the needle, 
               draws the required dosage, reaches over and gently shakes 
               Mead by the shoulder.

                                     NURSE DEVINE
                              (softly)
                         Mr. Mead... Mr. Mead, I have an 
                         injection for you.

               Mead sleeps on. Expressionlessly, Nurse Devine extracts Mead's 
               right arm from under the sheets, wets a swab with alcohol 
               and rubs down the vein. The needle slides into Mead's vein. 
               OVER THIS, we begin to hear a distant sibilant HISSING, 
               indistinct like the leakage of a bad heart. There is also an 
               occasional distinctly human but not quite civilized sound.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to Nurse Devine withdrawing the 
               needle, looking up, for she too has heard the soft, strange 
               sounds. They emanate from behind the curtains of the other 
               bed. Nurse Devine returns the syringe to the tray, gathers 
               her things and pads silently around Mead's bed to Drummond's 
               bed. With her free hand, she opens the curtains a little and 
               stares in.

                                     NURSE DEVINE
                         What the hell is going on in there?

               NURSE DEVINE'S P.O.V.: THE INDIAN AND BARBARA DRUMMOND BEND 
               OVER DRUMMOND PERFORMING SOME PAGAN RITUAL. THE HISSING IS 
               BARBARA'S CONTRIBUTION TO THE CEREMONY. (IT SOUNDS LIKE PIS-
               PIS, AND IS IN FACT AN IMITATION OF THE NIGHTHAWK, MEANT TO 
               APPEASE THE SPIRIT OF THE THUNDER.)

               The old Indian has stripped to the waist and marked his body 
               with smears of dye and tule pollen. He wears a ceremonial 
               hat, a sort of beaded beanie. He holds a small buckskin bag 
               of pollen in his cupped palms and is facing north, east, 
               south and west, offering the bag and prayers under his breath 
               as he does. A beaded amulet lies stretched across the white 
               sheet covering the comatose Drummond.

               When Nurse Devine draws the curtains, Barbara frowns at Nurse 
               Devine, holds a cautioning finger to her lips and draws the 
               curtains closed again. Nurse Devine, carrying her porcelain 
               tray, exits.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION

               Bock comes out of the elevator, jacketed now, fairly drunk 
               but holding it well.

               He heads for the Nurses' Station as Nurse Devine comes down 
               the west corridor. Bock grunts at Mrs. Dunne and goes into...

               PHARMACY

               ...where he quickly runs his finger along the second shelf 
               until he comes to the bottle of potassium which he filches 
               off the shelf and slips into his pocket. He rummages through 
               the drawers for a hypodermic syringe. Through the open 
               doorway, we see Nurse Devine making her way swiftly up to 
               Mrs. Dunne at the desk.

                                     NURSE DEVINE
                         Well, honey, we got a witch-doctor 
                         in Eight-O-Six, and you better go in 
                         there. You know that Indian that was 
                         sitting in Eight-O-Six all night? 
                         He's still there, and the girl's 
                         there, and they're doing some voodoo 
                         in there, and I ain't kidding.

               Behind Mrs. Dunne, Bock appears in the doorway to the pharmacy 
               where he stands listening.

                                     MRS. DUNNE
                              (looking up)
                         What are you talking about?

                                     NURSE DEVINE
                         I mean that Indian's in there, half-
                         naked and going pis-pis-pis with a 
                         little bag. You just better get in 
                         there, Mrs. Dunne.

               Mrs. Dunne, annoyed, gets up and heads for the west corridor, 
               followed by Nurse Devine and by an intrigued Dr. Bock at a 
               few paces behind.

                                     NURSE DEVINE
                              (to NURSE WEITZENBAUM, 
                              coming out of another 
                              room)
                         You want to see somethin', baby? You 
                         jus' come here.

               As the small procession bears down, Barbara Drummond slips 
               out of that room to intercept them.

                                     BARBARA
                              (keeping her voice 
                              low)
                         Look, it's a perfectly harmless 
                         ceremony, nothing to get excited 
                         about. It'll be over in a few minutes 
                         anyway. Mr. Blacktree is a shaman 
                         who gets his power from the thunder, 
                         and it's imperative he conclude his 
                         rituals while the storm is still 
                         going on.

                                     NURSE DUNNE
                         Visiting hours were over at nine 
                         o'clock, Miss.

               Bock reaches for the door to the room.

                                     BARBARA
                         All that's going on in there, Doctor, 
                         is a simple Apache prayer for my 
                         father's recovery.

               Bock makes a vague noise, neither contradicting her nor 
               assenting, and continues around her into...

               ROOM 806

               As Bock slides in, a bit of the corridor light comes in with 
               him. The curtains have been left sufficiently open to reveal 
               Mr. Blacktree. He is still stripped to the waist and marked 
               with crosses of pollen. He extends two twigs to the four 
               directions after which he places the twigs carefully on the 
               white sheet covering Drummond in a pattern around the amulet 
               already there. Behind Bock, Mrs. Dunne can be seen peeking 
               in. The Indian is oblivious to both of them. Bock watches it 
               all with interest for a moment and then backs out into...

               EIGHTH FLOOR CORRIDOR

               ...closing the door after him.

                                     BARBARA
                         The markings he's made on my father's 
                         arms are from the pollen of the tule 
                         plant. The twigs have no significance 
                         other than they've been struck by 
                         lightning and are consequently appeals 
                         to the spirit of lightning. It's all 
                         entirely harmless, a religious 
                         ceremony, not a medical one.

                                     BOCK
                         You don't seriously believe all that 
                         mumbo-jumbo will cure him?

                                     BARBARA
                         On the other hand, it won't kill 
                         him, Doctor.

               They regard each other levelly.

                                     BOCK
                              (grunts)
                         Okay. Go ahead.

               He wheels and clumps off for the stairway exit.

                                     BARBARA
                         Thank you.

               Nurse Weitzenbaum opens the door of the room and peeks in. 
               At the stairway exit, Bock pauses to look back at all the 
               women in front of Room 806.

                                     BOCK
                         Miss Drummond, are you still taking 
                         your father out?

                                     BARBARA
                         Yes. I still have to arrange an 
                         ambulance service. Is there a phone 
                         around I could use?

                                     BOCK
                         Use my office.

                                     BARBARA
                         Thank you.

               Bock exits. Barbara edges past Weitzenbaum, who is still 
               peeking into the room.

               ROOM 806

               Barbara comes in, gathers her coat and purse from a chair 
               and moves to the Indian, now occupied with what seems to be 
               the rolling of a cigarette. The two exchange a brief dialogue 
               in Apache. The old Indian nods. Barbara turns and exits, 
               taking Nurse Weitzenbaum out with her and closing the door. 
               The room is dark and hushed again. Blacktree lights his 
               cigarette and "sends the smoke up," a ritual which consists 
               of puffing smoke to each of the four directions, muttering 
               in Apache "May all be well" after each puff.

               CAMERA SLOWLY PANS to the other bed where William Mead sleeps 
               fitfully. The Apache words and pis-pis-pis penetrate Mead's 
               drugged sleep. He opens one eyelid and stares glazedly at 
               the dark air. The SOUNDS persist. Blacktree chooses this 
               moment to sidle out from behind the curtains and continue 
               his ritual in the less-confined space at the head of 
               Drummond's bed. It's quite a sight for a nervous, sedated 
               man to wake to.  Thunder RUMBLES and the rain SLASHES and a 
               sudden, savage STREAK of lightning illuminates it all.

               Mead figures it's all a bad dream and, after a moment of 
               dully regarding the odd spectacle, closes his one eye and 
               goes back to sleep.

               BOCK'S OFFICE, OUTER OFFICE

               Barbara Drummond comes in. Bock has apparently turned the 
               lights on for her, but Bock himself is not immediately 
               visible. She looks through the half-open door to Bock's 
               private office, and there he is, staring blankly at the 
               bottle. Barbara starts to say something, thinks better of 
               it, lays down her coat, and looking around, spots a Manhattan 
               classified directory which she hauls up from its shelf and 
               sets on Miss Lebow's desk. She sits, quickly flips through 
               the pages.

               Barbara flips through the directory. Bock is partially visible 
               in the background at his desk. He sits soddenly. Barbara 
               finds what she wants, opens her purse and takes out two 
               airplane tickets. She dials. The CLICKING of the dial catches 
               Bock's ear. He looks up for a moment.

                                     BARBARA
                              (on phone)
                         Hello. I'd like to arrange an 
                         ambulance for one-thirty tomorrow 
                         afternoon... Thank you...

               REVERSE ACROSS Bock at his desk with Barbara partially visible 
               at Miss Lebow's desk. All he can see are her great long tanned 
               legs.

                                     BARBARA
                              (in background on 
                              phone)
                         ...Drummond, first name, Barbara. 
                         I'll pay cash...

               Bock stands a little unsteadily and moves around his desk to 
               get a better look at those legs.

                                     BARBARA
                              (on phone)
                         No, you're to pick up my father, 
                         Drummond, Edward, at the Manhattan 
                         Medical Center, Holly Pavilion, Room 
                         Eight-O-Six. It's a stretcher case. 
                         I presume you provide the stretcher.

               She senses Bock watching her, turns, smiles. She's a very 
               beautiful girl. She returns to the phone.

                                     BARBARA
                         He's to be taken to American Airlines, 
                         Yes... No... Kennedy Airport, Flight 
                         Seven-Two-Nine to Yuma, Arizona. 
                         I'll accompany the patient... Yes, 
                         thank you.

               She returns the receiver to its cradle. When she looks up 
               again, Bock is no longer there. She returns the flight tickets 
               to her purse, snaps it shut, stands and moves to the doorway, 
               enters a step into...

               BOCK'S OFFICE

               Bock, back at his desk, looks up.

                                     BOCK
                         You believe in witchcraft, Miss 
                         Drummond?

                                     BARBARA
                         I believe in everything, Doctor.

                                     BOCK
                         Like a drink?

                                     BARBARA
                         Yes.

               Bock drains his glass and pours her a hefty shot of bourbon.

                                     BARBARA
                              (from the door suddenly)
                         My father, you should know, was a 
                         very successful doctor in Boston, a 
                         member of the Harvard Medical Faculty. 
                         He was a widower, and I was his only 
                         child. He was not an especially 
                         religious man, a sober Methodist. 
                         One evening, seven years ago, he 
                         attended a Pentecostal meeting in 
                         the commons rooms at Harvard and 
                         suddenly found himself speaking in 
                         tongues.
                              (she takes her drink 
                              and crosses to the 
                              sofa)
                         That is to say, he suddenly sank to 
                         his knees at the back of the room 
                         and began to talk fluently in a 
                         language which no one had ever heard 
                         before. This sort of thing happens 
                         frequently at Pentecostal meetings, 
                         and they began to happen regularly 
                         to my father.
                              (she sits)
                         It was not unusual to walk into our 
                         home and find my father sitting in 
                         his office, utterly serene and happily 
                         speaking to the air in this strange 
                         foreign tongue. I was, at that time 
                         twenty years old and having my 
                         obligatory affair with a minority 
                         group, in my case a Hopi Indian, a 
                         post-graduate fellow at Harvard doing 
                         his doctorate in the aboriginal 
                         languages of the Southwest. One day, 
                         I brought the Indian boy home just 
                         as my father was sinking to his knees 
                         in the entrance foyer in one of his 
                         trances. The Indian wheeled in his 
                         tracks and said, "Well, I'll be a 
                         sonofabitch." You see, my father was 
                         speaking an Apache dialect, an obscure 
                         dialect at that, spoken only by a 
                         ragged band of unreconstructed Indians 
                         who had rejected the reservation and 
                         were living in total isolation in 
                         the Sierra Madre Mountains of northern 
                         Mexico. Well! What do you say to 
                         that, Dr. Bock?

                                     BOCK
                              (who has been staring 
                              at her as if she 
                              were insane)
                         What the hell am I supposed to say 
                         to that, Miss Drummond?

               Barbara throws back her head and roars with laughter.

                                     BOCK
                         I'm sitting here boozing and, all of 
                         a sudden, you start telling me some 
                         demented story about your father's 
                         religious conversion.

                                     BARBARA
                         No, no, you miss the point, Doctor. 
                         Not my father's conversion -- mine. 
                         You see, I had been hitting the acid 
                         pretty regularly at that time. I had 
                         achieved a few minor sensory 
                         deformities, some suicidal despairs, 
                         but nothing as wild as fluency in an 
                         obscure Apache dialect. I mean, like 
                         wow, man! I mean, here was living 
                         afflatus right before my eyes! Within 
                         a week, my father had closed his 
                         Beacon Hill practice and set out to 
                         start a mission in the Mexican 
                         mountains. And I turned in my S.D.S. 
                         card and my crash helmet and followed 
                         him. It was a disaster, at least for 
                         me. My father had received the 
                         revelation, not I. He stood gaunt on 
                         a mountain slope and preached the 
                         apocalypse to solemnly amused Indians. 
                         I masturbated a great deal. We lived 
                         in a grass wickiup and ate raw rabbit 
                         and crushed piñon nuts. It was 
                         hideous. Within two months, I was 
                         back in Boston, a hollow shell and 
                         dizzy with dengue, disenchanted with 
                         everything. I turned to austerity, 
                         combed my hair tight and entered 
                         nursing school. I became haggard, 
                         driven and had shamelessly incestuous 
                         dreams about my father. I took up 
                         with some of the senior staff at the 
                         hospital. One of them, a portly 
                         psychiatrist, explained I was 
                         generated by an unresolved lust for 
                         my father. I apparently cracked up. 
                         One day, they found me walking to 
                         work naked and screaming obscenities. 
                         There was talk of institutionalizing 
                         me, so I packed a bag and went back 
                         to my father in the Sierra Madre 
                         Mountains. I've been there ever since. 
                         That's three years. My father is, of 
                         course, mad as a hatter. I watch 
                         over him and have been curiously 
                         content. You see, Doctor, I believe 
                         in everything.

               She pauses, her story over. Throughout, Bock has been trying 
               to keep his glowering eye on the desktop. During her long 
               narrative, he once seized the bottle and took a swig. Mostly 
               he is finding the experience murkily sensual. His glance 
               keeps darting out from under his brows to surreptitiously 
               look at the beautiful long tanned legs; or, when she bends 
               for the drink she set on the floor, to peer down the flapping 
               open scalloped neck of her dress; she is bra-less.

               She, on the other hand, has been crossing and uncrossing her 
               legs, bending, stretching, so that her short dress has ridden 
               up almost to her waist and is saved from utter exhibitionism 
               only by the darkness of the shadows. She seems unaffected by 
               Bock's voyeuristic interest in her, but she is surely not 
               unaware of it. It is hard to believe she is not courting his 
               attention.

                                     BOCK
                         Now what was that all about, Miss 
                         Drummond?

                                     BARBARA
                         I thought I was obvious as hell. I'm 
                         trying to tell you I have a thing 
                         for middle-aged men.

                                     BOCK
                         I admire your candor.

                                     BARBARA
                         You've been admiring a lot more than 
                         that.

               Bock looks up, and they suddenly find their eyes locked. The 
               dark, dense air in the room fairly steams with incipient

                         You're wasting your time. I've been 
                         impotent for years.

                         Rubbish.

               With a crash of his fist on the desktop, Bock stands; he is 
               in a drunken rage.

                         What the hell's wrong with being 
                         impotent? My God, you kids are more 
                         hung up on sex than the Victorians! 
                         I've got a son, twenty-three. I threw 
                         him out of the house last year. 
                         Pietistic little humbug. He preached 
                         universal love and despised everyone. 
                         He had a blanket contempt for the 
                         middle class, even its decencies. He 
                         detested my mother because she had 
                         petit bourgeois pride in her son the 
                         doctor. I cannot tell you how 
                         brutishly he ignored that rather 
                         good old lady. When she died, he 
                         didn't even come to the funeral. He 
                         thought the chapel service an 
                         hypocrisy. His generation didn't 
                         live with lies, he told me. "Everybody 
                         lives with lies," I said. I grabbed 
                         him by his poncho, dragged him the 
                         full length of our seven-room 
                         despicably affluent middle-class 
                         apartment and flung him out. I haven't 
                         seen him since. But do you know what 
                         he said to me as he stood there on 
                         that landing on the verge of tears. 
                         He shrieked at me: "You old fink! 
                         You can't even get it up anymore!" 
                         That was it, you see. That was his 
                         real revolution. It wasn't racism 
                         and the oppressed poor and the war 
                         in Vietnam. The ultimate American 
                         societal sickness was a limp dingus. 
                         Hah!
                              (he lurches about, 
                              laughing rustily)
                         My God, if there is a despised and 
                         misunderstood minority in this 
                         country, it's us poor impotent 
                         bastards. Well, I'm impotent and 
                         proud of it! Impotence is beautiful, 
                         baby!

                         baby!

                              her)
                         When I say impotent, I don't mean 
                         merely limp. Disagreeable as it may 
                         be for a woman, a man may sometimes 
                         lust for other things, something 
                         less transient than an erection, 
                         some sense of permanent worth. That's 
                         what medicine was for me, my reason 
                         for being. When I was thirty-four, 
                         Miss Drummond, I presented a paper 
                         before the annual convention of the 
                         Society of Clinical Investigation 
                         that pioneered the whole goddam field 
                         of immunology. A breakthrough! I'm 
                         in all the textbooks. I happen to be 
                         an eminent man, Miss Drummond. And 
                         you want to know something, Miss 
                         Drummond? I don't give a goddam. 
                         When I say I'm impotent, I mean I've 
                         lost even my desire for work, which 
                         is a hell of a lot more primal a 
                         passion than sex. I've lost my raison 
                         d'etre, my purpose, the only thing I 
                         ever truly loved. It's all rubbish 
                         anyway. Transplants, antibodies, we 
                         manufacture genes, we can produce 
                         birth ectogenetically, we can 
                         practically clone people like carrots, 
                         and half the kids in this ghetto 
                         haven't even been inoculated for 
                         polio! We have assembled the most 
                         enormous medical establishment ever 
                         conceived, and people are sicker 
                         than ever! We cure nothing! We heal 
                         nothing! The whole goddam wretched 
                         world is strangulating in front of 
                         our eyes! That's what I mean when I 
                         say impotent! You don't know what 
                         the hell I'm talking about, do you?

                                     BARBARA
                         Of course, I do.

                         I'm tired, I'm terribly tired, Miss 
                         Drummond. And I hurt, and I've got 
                         nothing going for me anymore. Can 
                         you understand that?

                                     BARBARA
                         Yes, of course.

                         only admissable matter left is death?

               He suspects he is going to cry and turns quickly away. He 
               sits heavily and fights his tears.

                         Sounds to me like a familiar case of 
                         morbid menopause.

                         Well, it's hard for me to take your 
                         despair very seriously, Doctor. You 
                         obviously enjoy it so much.

                         ...acidhead's going to reassure me 
                         about menopause now. Look, I'd like 
                         to be alone, so why don't you beat 
                         it? Close the door and turn off the 
                         lights on your way out.

               They are both suddenly conscious of a third presence in the 
               room. They look to the door where Mr. Blacktree, fully clothed 
               again and carrying his coat, is standing in the doorway. 
               Barbara uncrosses her long legs and stands.

                                     BARBARA
                              (crossing to the door)
                         Mr. Blacktree disapproves of my 
                         miniskirt, but it was the only thing 
                         I had to come to the city with. Back 
                         at the tribe, I wear ankle-length 
                         buckskin.

                                     BOCK
                         Swell. Just close the door and turn 
                         off the lights.

               Barbara regards his hunched form and, murmuring in Apache, 
               she exits, closing the door. In the subsequent hush, thunder 
               RUMBLES and CRASHES. Wind sweeps the rain against the window 
               panes.

               The sounds go unheeded by Bock, still as marble. Slowly, he 
               raises his head and sighs and then fishes about in his jacket 
               pockets to bring out the bottle of potassium and syringe. He 
               takes off his jacket, rolling up his shirtsleeve, poking 
               about for the vein. He removes his trouser belt, which he 
               ties tightly about his upper arm for a tourniquet. Now, he 
               tears the wrapping of the syringe and fits the needle to it. 
               Fiddling about in the pockets of his jacket, he finally finds 
               a crumpled pack of cigarettes. He lights one and returns to 
               the business of killing himself, puffing expressionlessly as 
               he does. Thunder RUMBLES and rain SLASHES. He carefully draws 
               just the right amount of potassium from the bottle to the 
               syringe, peering at the procedure against the light of his 
               desk lamp. He sets the cigarette on the ashtray, switches 
               the hypodermic to his right hand, holds his left arm rigidly 
               out under the light of the lamp...

                                     BARBARA'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         What're you shooting, Doc?

               He turns slowly to the doorway, his bare left arm still 
               rigidly extended, the belt dangling, the hypodermic clenched 
               in his other hand. Barbara is perfectly framed in the doorway. 
               He stares at her, slowly suffusing with the numb, blind, 
               total rage of the aborted suicide. The thunder CRASHES.

                                     BOCK
                              (barely gets the words 
                              out)
                         Leave me alone...

               She approaches the desk affably, turns the potassium around 
               to read the label.

                                     BARBARA
                         Potassium. You take enough of this 
                         stuff, it'll kill you, Doc.
                              (moves toward the 
                              couch)
                         It occurred to me that I might have 
                         read you wrong, that you really were 
                         suicidal. So I came back.

               Bock's rage erupts. He crashes the hypodermic syringe down, 
               shattering it. The potassium puddles on the wood.

                                     BOCK
                              (hysterical rage)
                         Who the hell asked you!

               He moves around the desk, a shambling bear of a man, a leather 
               belt dangling dementedly from his arm, tears coursing down 
               his cheeks. He advances on her in a stuperous shuffle.

                                     BOCK
                         Who the hell asked you!

               She regards his lumbering approach with a faint, grotesquely 
               sensual smile. He reaches with his naked left arm to the 
               neck of her dress and, with one savage wrench, rips her stark 
               naked, sobbing through hysterical tears.

                                     BOCK
                         Leave me alone! Why the hell don't 
                         you leave me alone!

               He is on her, crushing her down into the shadows of the couch, 
               ravenous at her neck and shoulders in a brutish assault, 
               sobbing.

                                     BOCK
                         Why didn't you let me do it? Who the 
                         hell asked you!

               Throughout the scene, CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY IN through the 
               flesh and fury to an INTENSE TWO-SHOT of this terrified act 
               of love. Then slowly over Bock's plunging shoulder to the 
               woman's face. She gasps at the moment of penetration, then 
               her lovely face slowly shapes into smiling serenity. Bock 
               sobs; even in the shadows we can see the path of the tears 
               on his cheek.

               ABRUPT SILENCE.

               OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL, NIGHT. 4:00 A.M.

               The quiet, black streets glisten wetly in the puddles of 
               lamplight.

               THE STEINMETZ PAVILION, TENTH FLOOR

               The night shift is finishing up. THERESA CAMPANELLA, R.N., a 
               high-strung girl in her early twenties, stands at a water 
               tap holding a glass and popping some pills in her mouth. To 
               the room:

                                     CAMPANELLA
                         Well, I'll see you.

               TENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR. NIGHT

               Campanella comes out of the Dialysis room, puts on her coat 
               and walks to...

               HOLLY PAVILION LOBBY. NIGHT

               Campanella moves down the empty corridor. All the doors are 
               closed now; only the overhead light in the background of the 
               corridor glows weakly. Campanella puts a cigarette in her 
               mouth, pauses to look for matches; she hasn't any. Scowling 
               with annoyance, she continues to the lobby and stops by a 
               partially visible white-jacketed figure reading a newspaper.

                                     CAMPANELLA
                         Do you have a match, Doctor?

               She takes the matches, lights her cigarette, inhaling deeply, 
               when he suddenly sandbags her from behind. She goes down.

               BOCK'S OFFICE. DAYBREAK, WEDNESDAY

               Covered by Bock's overcoat, Barbara tosses and turns on the 
               couch in a small nightmare. Through the windows comes the 
               first gray wash of dawn. FULL SHOT of Barbara, awake and up 
               on one elbow on the verge of a scream. She looks around the 
               room. It is dark, empty, silent.

               ACROSS Barbara looking through the door to the secretarial 
               office. It is likewise dark, but suddenly the lights go on 
               and, a moment later, Bock enters. He holds a container of 
               coffee in each hand and has something white draped over his 
               forearm. From under Bock's bulky coat, Barbara watches him 
               lumber to his desk, where he sets the containers of coffee 
               down. He drops the whitish garment over the back of a chair 
               and then sits. He hoists a bulging folder of correspondence 
               from his filing tray and hunches to work, reading. After a 
               moment, he regards the silent figure on the couch across the 
               room.

                                     BOCK
                         You wouldn't be awake.

                                     BARBARA
                         What time is it?

               He rises, picks up the second container and white dress from 
               the chair. She reaches out an arm for the coffee. Bock holds 
               up -- a nurse's uniform.

                                     BOCK
                         I swiped this for you out of the 
                         nurses' locker room. I'll make good 
                         on your dress. I'm afraid it's torn 
                         beyond repair. Buy yourself a new 
                         one or, if you like, give me your 
                         size and I'll send it on to you. But 
                         I want to talk to you about that.

                                     BARBARA
                         Talk to me about what?

                                     BOCK
                         About your father. You really 
                         shouldn't move him in his condition. 
                         I just had a look at his chart. 
                         There's no reason to presume brain 
                         damage. You know as well as I you 
                         can't predict anything in these 
                         instances. He could pull out of that 
                         coma at any time. I think you should 
                         let him stay here. I'll personally 
                         look after him.

               He has perched on the edge of the couch, and she rests her 
               cheek against the long, bent curve of his back, smiling.

                                     BARBARA
                         Is this your way of saying you'd 
                         like me to stay in town a few more 
                         days?

               He turns to look at her, smiles back.

                                     BOCK
                         Well, that would be nice, too.

               She sips her coffee.

                                     BOCK
                         What do you say, Miss Drummond?

                                     BARBARA
                         I expect you can call me Barbara, 
                         considering you ravished me three 
                         times last night.

                                     BOCK
                         Three times?

                                     BARBARA
                         Oh, look at him, pretending he didn't 
                         count. You were as puffed up as a 
                         toad about it. Punched a couple of 
                         holes in your crusade for universal 
                         impotence, didn't it? I think we're 
                         on a first name basis by now. I'll 
                         call you Herb.

                                     BOCK
                         Let's give your father a week, 
                         Barbara, what do you say?

                                     BARBARA
                              (a frown darkens her 
                              face)
                         No, I don't want my father in this 
                         hospital. I had a dream about this 
                         hospital.
                              (some of the terror 
                              shows on her face)
                         I dreamt this enormous starched white 
                         tile building suddenly erupted like 
                         a volcano, and all the patients, 
                         doctors, nurses, attendants, 
                         orderlies, the whole line staff, the 
                         food service people, the aged, the 
                         lame -- and you right in the middle -- 
                         were stampeding in one hideous 
                         screaming suicidal mass into the 
                         sea.
                              (she stares at him 
                              wide-eyed, reliving 
                              the dream)
                         I'm taking my father out of here -- 
                         and as quickly as I can.

               They stare at each other, she in terror, he with affection.

                                     BOCK
                         You're a real fruitcake, you know?

               She sets her coffee down on the couch and decides to wear 
               Bock's overcoat rather than use it as a cover. She searches 
               for the sleeves. Bock assists her.

                                     BARBARA
                         Well, let me put it this way. I love 
                         you. I fancied you from the first 
                         moment you came lumbering down that 
                         hallway upstairs. I said to Mr. 
                         Blacktree, "Who's that hulking bear 
                         of a man?" The Apaches are reverential 
                         about bears. They won't eat bear 
                         meat; they never skin bears. Bear is 
                         thought of as both benign and evil, 
                         but very strong power. Men with bear 
                         power are highly respected and are 
                         frequently said to be great healers.

               By now she's standing, the overcoat reaching her toes. She 
               looks down at Bock perched on the couch.

                                     BARBARA
                         I said to Mr. Blacktree, "That man 
                         gets his power from the bear."

                                     BOCK
                         Swell. Now, look, do you have a hotel, 
                         some sort of accommodations where 
                         you can stay for a week or so?

               Barbara reaches for her coffee, sips, moves around in her 
               tent of a coat.

                                     BARBARA
                         All right, let me put it this way, 
                         Herb. My father and I accept the 
                         implacability of death. If he dies, 
                         he dies, but I'm taking him out of 
                         here and back to Mexico about one 
                         o'clock this afternoon. I want you 
                         to come with us, because I love you 
                         and want children.

                                     BOCK
                         I'm afraid Mexico sounds a little 
                         too remote for me.

                                     BARBARA
                         We could use you down there, you 
                         know. There's a curiously high 
                         incidence of T.B. And you'd be a 
                         doctor again, Herb. You'd be necessary 
                         again. If you love me, I don't see 
                         what other choice you have.

                                     BOCK
                         What do you mean, if I love you? I 
                         raped you in a suicidal rage. How 
                         did we get to love and children all 
                         of a sudden?

                                     BARBARA
                         Oh, for heaven's sake, Herb, I ought 
                         to know if a man loves me or not. 
                         You must have told me half a hundred 
                         times last night you loved me. You 
                         murmured it, shouted it; one time, 
                         you opened the window and bellowed 
                         it out into the street.

                                     BOCK
                         I think those were more expressions 
                         of gratitude than love.

                                     BARBARA
                         Gratitude for what?

                                     BOCK
                         Well, my God, for resurrecting 
                         feelings of life in me I thought 
                         dead.

                                     BARBARA
                         Well, my God, what do you think love 
                         is?

                                     BOCK
                         Okay, I love you, and you love me. 
                         I'm not about to argue with so 
                         relentless a romantic. Well, then, 
                         since we have this great passion 
                         going for us, I don't see why you 
                         won't stay on here in New York for a 
                         week or ten days...

                                     BARBARA
                         It's up to ten days now.

                                     BOCK
                         As long as it takes for your father's 
                         condition to improve.

                                     BARBARA
                         No. I've had these prophetic dreams 
                         for seven nights. Seven is a sinister 
                         number. The meaning of these dreams 
                         is very clear, seven times as clear. 
                         I am to get my father and you out of 
                         this hospital before we are all 
                         destroyed.

                                     BOCK
                              (throws up his hands)
                         You're certifiable! My God, half the 
                         time you're a perfectly intelligent 
                         young woman, and then suddenly you 
                         turn into a goddam cabalist who 
                         believes in dreams, witchcraft and 
                         bear power! And I don't like the way 
                         you dismiss my whole life as 
                         unnecessary. I do a lot of healing 
                         right here in Manhattan. I don't 
                         have to go to Mexico for it. I also 
                         teach. I send out eighty doctors a 
                         year into the world, sometimes 
                         inspirited, at least competent. I've 
                         built up one of the best damned 
                         departments of medicine in the world. 
                         We've got a hell of a heart unit 
                         here and a hell of a kidney group. A 
                         lot of people come into this hospital 
                         in big trouble, Miss Drummond, and 
                         go out better for the experience. So 
                         don't tell me how unnecessary I am.

                                     BARBARA
                              (who's been slipping 
                              into the nurse's 
                              uniform)
                         Yeah?

                                     BOCK
                         Yeah.

                                     BARBARA
                         So how come, eight hours ago, you 
                         were trying to kill yourself with an 
                         overdose of potassium?

                                     BOCK
                         Where are you going now?

               This last in reference to Barbara crossing to the secretaries' 
               office, zippering her uniform.

                              (gathering her coat

                         My hotel. I have to check out. Mr. 
                         Blacktree doesn't speak any English.

                                     BOCK
                              (from the connecting 
                              doorway)
                         Well, you're coming back, of course.

                                     BARBARA
                         Of course. I have to settle the bill 
                         here and pack my father. And I think 
                         you need a few hours alone to make 
                         your decisions.

                                     BOCK
                         What decisions?

                                     BARBARA
                         You're a very tired and very damaged 
                         man. You've had a hideous marriage 
                         and I assume a few tacky affairs 
                         along the way. You're understandably 
                         reluctant to get involved again. 
                         And, on top of that, here I am with 
                         the preposterous idea you throw 
                         everything up and go off with me to 
                         some barren mountains of Mexico. It 
                         sounds utterly mad, I know. On the 
                         other hand, you obviously find this 
                         world as desolate as I do. You did 
                         try to kill yourself last night. So 
                         that's it, Herb. Either me and the 
                         mountains or the bottle of potassium. 
                         I'll be back in an hour or so. I'll 
                         be in my father's room.

               She slips into her coat and exits, as Bock looks after her 
               thoughtfully, then turns back to his own office.

               BOCK'S OFFICE

               He shuffles around distractedly, not knowing how to articulate 
               the exuberance he feels. Suddenly, he opens the window, leans 
               out and bellows to the empty air.

                                     BOCK
                         All right. I love you!
                              (softly)
                         My God!

               FIRST AVENUE, CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAWN

               A construction sign fills the screen. It reads ON THIS 
               LOCATION, THE NEW YORK MEDICAL UNIVERSITY CENTER WILL BUILD 
               A DRUG REHABILITATION COMMUNITY CENTER, TO BE COMPLETED IN 
               1973. E.F. SCHLAGER & CO., CONTRACTORS. Suddenly, the sign 
               comes crashing down into CAMERA. It has been wrenched off 
               the wooden fence protecting the row of tenements and 
               brownstones being demolished. About a dozen young and loud 
               militants have torn it down.

               CAMERA PANS to show the row of houses behind the fence, two 
               of which have already been reduced to rubble; the others 
               have been boarded up. The demolition generators and cranes 
               are parked silently along the curb. In the dark of 5:00 A.M., 
               three black families, carrying children, and children carrying 
               household effects, mattresses, pots, pans, bags of groceries, 
               etc., are repossessing the condemned buildings.

               FIRST AVENUE, CONSTRUCTION AREA. DAY, 10:00 A.M.

               Strong sun overhead. The street has been roped off, and police 
               are all over the place. A sparse crowd of a hundred or so 
               throng the sidestreets off First Avenue. Signs read, "People 
               Sí, Doctors No." A Channel 11 mobile news crew, newspaper 
               photographers, and a radio newscaster are recording the 
               situation with desultory interest.

               A POLICE CAPTAIN stands in the middle of the cordoned street, 
               bullhorning the occupiers of the condemned brownstones, who 
               can be seen through the broken windows.

                                     POLICE CAPTAIN
                         I repeat. I'm asking you to come out 
                         peacefully. These buildings are 
                         condemned and unfit for habitation.

               A piece of brick arches down from the roof of a building and 
               cracks the street a few feet from the Captain.

                                     POLICE CAPTAIN
                              (sighs, tries again)
                         You people are possessing this 
                         building illegally and in violation 
                         of the law. I'm asking you to come 
                         out peacefully...

               HOLLY PAVILION, ENTRANCE LOBBY. DAY

               A small press conference is going on in a corner of the lobby. 
               Reporters cluster, and TV cameras surround the Press 
               Representative of the Hospital, a young woman in her thirties 
               named EVELYN BASSEY, who is trying to read a statement, 
               squinting under her mod glasses at the blaze of lights set 
               up by the camera crews.

                                     MRS. BASSEY
                              (reading)
                         ...complete sympathy with the tenants. 
                         So the hospital has assumed the 
                         responsibility of finding 400 housing 
                         units in good buildings. The hospital 
                         wishes to point out that this 
                         particular row of buildings on First 
                         Avenue was condemned by the City 
                         before the hospital acquired 
                         ownership, and even then, only after 
                         responsible leaders in the community 
                         had approved the building of our new 
                         drug rehabilitation center.

               SUNDSTROM'S OFFICE

                                     SUNDSTROM
                              (explodes on the phone)
                         Goddammit, Barry, I've got a dozen 
                         community leaders waiting for me in 
                         the library! We've been trying to 
                         work out some kind of negotiable 
                         formula for two years! And with no 
                         help from you people in the Urban 
                         Affairs Division, I might add!

               DR. WELBECK appears in the doorway. He's in his fifties, 
               gray, distinguished and very tanned with terribly, terribly 
               kindly old country doctor eyes. He wears a camel hair topcoat. 
               He smiles benignly and twinkles at Sundstrom from one of the 
               leather chairs across the desk from the Director.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                              (hardly notices Welbeck)
                         And I'm not going to throw all that 
                         down the drain because some cockamamie 
                         activist group is show-boating for 
                         the television cameras! You get those 
                         people out of those buildings before 
                         a wall collapses or a fire breaks 
                         out and we've got a riot on our 
                         hands!... Okay!

               He hangs up, sighs, turns to the man across the desk.

                                     WELBECK
                              (smiles, twinkles)
                         Having your troubles, eh? Well, I 
                         won't take much of your time. My 
                         name's Welbeck. I've been associated 
                         with this hospital for six years, 
                         and, yesterday afternoon, Dr. Gilley 
                         called me to say he was cutting off 
                         my privileges at the hospital. Do 
                         you know anything about it?

                                     SUNDSTROM
                              (glances at his watch)
                         It's news to me.

                                     WELBECK
                         He said he sent the report on.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         I'll probably get it tomorrow. Report 
                         on what?

                                     WELBECK
                         Well, I'm not sure myself. I did a 
                         nephrectomy on a man about seven 
                         days ago. Emergency, called in at 
                         four in the morning. The man was 
                         hemorrhaging, he'd gone sour...

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Welbeck, I'm terribly sorry, but I 
                         do have this meeting.
                              (crosses to the door)
                         In any event, there's nothing I can 
                         do about it. If Gilley wants to cut 
                         your privileges, he's Chief of 
                         Surgery, it's within his province. 
                         You'll have to have the hearing...

               He exits, followed by Welbeck into the...

               DIRECTOR'S SUITE, SECRETARIES' OFFICES

               Buzzing now. Typewriters clicking. Phones ringing.

                                     WELBECK
                         I have a laparotomy laid on for this 
                         morning. I assume I'll be allowed to 
                         go through with that.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Of course.

                                     WELBECK
                              (huffing a little)
                         I've been associated with this 
                         hospital for six years...

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Now, now, Welbeck. It seems to me 
                         I've had your name down here before 
                         for something...
                              (to his secretary en 
                              passant)
                         I'll be in the staff room.

               He and Welbeck pass out into the...

               EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

               Flowing with a normal stream of traffic, Sundstrom and Welbeck 
               turn right and head down to the last room of the corridor. 
               Something comes to him, and Sundstrom pauses.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Wait a minute. You're the fellow 
                         with the Medicaid collecting business 
                         who incorporated and went public, 
                         right? I mean, something like that? 
                         Milton Mead was telling me about you 
                         just the other day. You're a whole 
                         medical conglomerate. You've got a 
                         Factoring service, a computerized 
                         billing company, and a few proprietary 
                         hospitals, a few nursing homes. Good 
                         heavens, Welbeck, you shouldn't be 
                         brought up before a committee of 
                         mere doctors. You should be 
                         investigated by the Securities and 
                         Exchange Commission. You'll have to 
                         go through with the hearing, Welbeck. 
                         I don't interfere in these things.

               He opens the door of the staff room and strides in. Even 
               before he enters, we get a blast of angry voices, both male 
               and female. For the moment the door is ajar, we see a harried 
               Milton Mead being assailed by angry blacks and Puerto Ricans 
               and young white activist doctors.

                                     MAN
                         The point is that this hospital is 
                         the landlord for those buildings and 
                         they should've turned them down.

               Angrily, he leans over the table facing Sundstrom.

                                     MAN
                         Those buildings are imperialistic 
                         extensions of the medical 
                         establishment. This hospital ought 
                         to be rebuilding those tenements, 
                         give those people decent housing.

               Sundstrom raises his hands for quiet and starts to rise. The 
               hostile din has gotten to him.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Please, please, please!

               HOLLY PAVILION, ROOM

               William Mead is transferred from his bed to a rolling 
               stretcher by an orderly in shirt and trousers and by Nurse 
               Felicia Chile. Nurse Chile tucks Mead in. He opens his eyes 
               to look at her drowsily.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                              (under sedation)
                         You know, I hallucinated last night. 
                         I hallucinated there was an Indian 
                         doing a war dance in here.

                                     NURSE CHILE
                              (affably)
                         You weren't hallucinating, Mr. Mead. 
                         There was an Indian in here last 
                         night.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                              (staring through his 
                              sedation at her)
                         There was?

               They wheel him out into...

               HOLLY PAVILION, SURGICAL AREA CORRIDOR

               Mead is wheeled down the corridor by the orderly. At the far 
               end, an anesthetized patient, blue in the harsh light, fresh 
               from surgery, is being wheeled into a recovery room.

               Surgery is busy and efficient but not as clinically tidy as 
               we'd like. Linens and equipment and surgical gear are piled 
               into corners or on empty stretchers. Green-uniformed nurses, 
               doctors and orderlies go in and out of the many doors flanking 
               the corridor. This is the non-sterilized area, where doctors 
               and nurses confer in the corridors; three black orderlies 
               await an assignment, sit on stretchers, chuckle, mutter. 
               Phones can be heard RINGING. The orderly wheeling Mead turns 
               left into the...

               SURGICAL AREA, CENTRAL PLAZA

               ...a small, cluttered central area with the office of the 
               Operating Room Nursing Supervisor on the right and the Holding 
               (for Anesthesia) Room on the left. The O.R. is like the 
               Emergency Ward, desperately busy but staffed by people grown 
               so accustomed to it that they display a calm, almost casual 
               but febrile efficiency. A large blackboard faces the 
               Supervisor's Office with the day's schedule of operations 
               neatly chalked in. It is full. A middle-aged surgeon, still 
               in his overcoat, is studying the schedule.

               A green-uniformed NURSE swings through the glass doors from 
               the Operating Room area to lean into the Supervisor's Office.

                                     NURSE
                         Dr. Norris says about half an hour.

                                     SECOND NURSE
                         Tell Shirley it was just an ovarian 
                         cyst.

               The THIRD NURSE leans back into the Supervisor's Office to 
               relay this information.

                                     THIRD NURSE
                         Shirley, it was just an ovarian cyst!

               This is apparently good news, for we hear someone saying

                                     VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         Oh, thank God.

               An orderly rumbles by with an E.K.G. machine. O.R. Nursing 
               Supervisor DOROTHY KIMBALL, a pleasant lady in her late 
               thirties, leans out of her office to speak to one of the 
               lounging orderlies.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                              (handing the orderly 
                              a slip)
                         All right, Jerry, go up to Holly 
                         Six.

               The orderly detaches himself from his cronies and exits. It 
               is into this atmosphere of subdued febrility that William 
               Mead is wheeled.

                                     ORDERLY
                              (to Mrs. Kimball)
                         William Mead from Holly Eight.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                         Hold him there, Tom. We've got 
                         somebody coming out right now.

               Indeed, a stretcher is being wheeled out of the Holding Room. 
               The patient is sedated and covered. As the orderly wheels 
               her past CAMERA, we may recognize the pale, sleeping profile 
               of Miss Campanella, the nurse who had been coshed with a 
               sandbag not many scenes ago. A CIRCULATING NURSE comes through 
               the glass doors, examines the chart dangling from the 
               stretcher.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                              (to this nurse)
                         Who's that? Mangafranni?

                                     CIRCULATING NURSE
                              (checking wristband)
                         Yeah.
                              (to orderly)
                         Number three, Marty.

               The orderly wheels the silent Miss Campanella off to Operating 
               Room Three, as Dr. Welbeck, in his natty blue suit, carrying 
               his camel coat, turns in from the outer corridor and examines 
               the blackboard. He goes back to...

               OUTER CORRIDOR

               ...Welbeck crosses, opens a door and enters...

               SURGEONS' LOCKER ROOM

               All four walls are lined with lockers. Shelves and cartons 
               of green surgical clothes, caps, masks, trousers, shoe-
               coverings. Obviously, surgeons dress for their operations 
               here. Two surgeons, one middle-aged and the other a young 
               RESIDENT, are changing. The resident turns to Welbeck on his 
               entrance and says:

                                     RESIDENT
                         It's legal for a doctor to incorporate 
                         in New York, isn't it, Doctor?

                                     WELBECK
                              (en route to phone)
                         Since last September. If they had 
                         that when I was your age, I'd have 
                         put away a couple of million by now.
                              (dials)
                         It gives you a variety of deferral 
                         devices, profit-sharing for example. 
                         Let's say you pick yourself an October 
                         31-fiscal. You declare a bonus payable 
                         in '71. An accrued item payable to a 
                         principle share-holder must be paid 
                         within two and half months after the 
                         close of the year to get the deduction 
                         in the prior year. But your 
                         corporation doesn't pay that tax, 
                         because we've eliminated the taxable 
                         income with the bonus. With two 
                         taxable entities, you can bury a 
                         hell of a lot of expenses...
                              (on phone)
                         Hello, this is Welbeck, any 
                         messages?... Well, I'm at the 
                         hospital. I have to cut open some 
                         guy in a couple of minutes. I'll try 
                         to make it as fast as I can. How 
                         urgent did he say it was?... Well, 
                         Dr. Hogan made those arrangements 
                         with the underwriters. The 
                         Registration Statement was filed 
                         with the S.E.C. well over a year 
                         ago... If he calls again, have me 
                         paged here.
                              (hangs up, turns back 
                              to the attentive 
                              young doctors to 
                              conduct his class in 
                              medical finance while 
                              changing into surgical 
                              scrub)
                         The really big money is in health 
                         leasing, of course. Dr. Hogan, the 
                         eminent orthopedic surgeon, and I 
                         incorporated a leasing company and 
                         went public last year. I hold a 
                         controlling interest in a number of 
                         proprietary hospitals, nursing homes 
                         and rest farms, and I've been leasing 
                         hospital equipment to my own hospitals 
                         at excessive rates. Why, you ask, am 
                         I draining my own hospitals? Well, 
                         my hospitals are taxed at 48 percent, 
                         and I'm giving my leasing company a 
                         hell of a price-earnings ratio, 
                         which'll balloon the market value of 
                         the stock. I hold three hundred 
                         thousand shares of that stock, 
                         lettered of course, but in a year, 
                         I'll dump those shares at a capital 
                         gain and walk off with a bundle...

               OPERATING ROOM THREE

               Just like on TV -- well, almost. The surgeon, DR. MALLORY, a 
               bad-tempered man in his fifties, sits on a stool with his 
               gloved hands wrapped in a towel, waiting for the two surgical 
               RESIDENTS to finish painting the operable area, which happens 
               to be the abdomen. It's a hysterectomy. The patient is sheeted 
               except for the small square of abdominal area.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         Mangafranni, right?

                                     SCRUB NURSE
                         Right.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                              (grumbles to one of 
                              the residents)
                         What do you say, huh? We're not going 
                         to hang it in the Louvre, you know.

               The anesthesiologist, DR. CHU, injects pentathol in the I.V. 
               tube.

                                     DR. CHU
                         Bring a mask over.

               The RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST trundles over the oxygen tank, 
               takes the hypodermic syringe from Dr. Chu, who now applies 
               the oxygen mask to the enmarbled profile of the patient. He 
               studies the gauges and equipment around him at the head of 
               the operating table.

                                     RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST
                         There's no pulse, Doctor.

                                     DR. CHU
                         What's the pressure?

                                     RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST
                         There's no blood pressure, Doctor.

                                     DR. CHU
                         No pulse. Get the tube and E.K.G.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         What's the matter?

                                     RESIDENT
                         I can't feel a thing, sir.

               The room galvanizes into the swift, silent activity of a 
               chest massage. Dr. Mallory, standing and stretching in the 
               back of the room, turns and moves toward the off-screen 
               patient. He begins a vigorous rhythmic massage of the 
               patient's rib cage over the heart.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         What the hell happened?

               Dr. Mallory thumps the patient's chest hard with his fist, 
               and the others, likewise, go to work.

                                     DR. CHU
                         I don't know. She must have thrown 
                         an embolus. She was doing fine up to 
                         now.
                              (to Resident 
                              Anesthesiologist)
                         Did you check the gasses?

                                     RESIDENT ANESTHESIOLOGIST
                         I did, sir.

                                     DR. CHU
                         The only time I ever saw anybody 
                         conk out like this, some jerk switched 
                         the nitrous oxide and the gas lines.

               The scrub nurse is applying electrode paste to the 
               defibrillators. Dr. Mallory yanks the sheets and hospital 
               shirt off the patient and begins very rigorous massage of 
               the exposed ribs; we can hear one rib crack.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         Get the damn leads on. For Chrissakes, 
                         what the hell is this?!

                                     RESIDENT
                         She's just a young woman, sir. Do 
                         you think we should open the chest?

                                     DR. MALLORY
                              (defibrillating)
                         She's fifty-three, you buttonhead!

                                     RESIDENT
                              (off-screen)
                         Bicarb?

               Dr. Chu, who has been inserting some suprel and bicarbonate 
               into the tube of the patient's I.V., is frowning at her rigid, 
               white-capped face. He leans over to check the E.K.G. readings.

                                     DR. CHU
                         She's fibrillating, Doctor.

               Mallory straddles the patient. He's doing heavy heart massage.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         Jesus H. Christ!

                                     DR. CHU
                         Okay, stop for a minute... Doctor...

               Dr. Chu pushes back, the operating cap on the patient's head, 
               revealing jet-black hair. Mallory starts to massage again.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                              (barking at the scrub 
                              nurse)
                         You got those paddles ready?

               Dr. Chu stares blankly at the patient's face, then looks up 
               at the sweating surgeon, perched on the operating table, 
               rhythmically crushing away at the patient's rib cage.

                                     DR. CHU
                         I may be crazy, Doctor, but I don't 
                         think this is your patient.

               Dr. Mallory, now pausing for a moment, looks up. He is beaded 
               with sweat.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         What the hell are you talking about?

               He massages away. Another rib cracks.

               HOLLY PAVILION, BOCK'S OFFICE

               The Supervisor of Nurses, Mrs. Christie, is sitting on a 
               chair reading a report. Bock, now in his doctor's coat, is 
               hunched over his desk, hands clasped.

                                     BOCK
                         Now, I don't want to get into an 
                         institutional hassle with you, Mrs. 
                         Christie. The malpractice here is 
                         monumental. As you see, Dr. Schaefer's 
                         blood sugar was twenty-three. No 
                         glucose solution is going to do that. 
                         The only thing that will do that is 
                         at least fifty units of insulin, 
                         probably more. The only presumption 
                         is that one of those nurses on the 
                         Eighth Floor shot fifty units of 
                         insulin into Schaefer's blood stream, 
                         either by injection or through the 
                         I.V., although how in God's name...

               Mrs. Christie's electric pocket-pager BEEPS.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         I'm very sorry, Doctor.
                              (reaches for a phone)
                         May I?

               Miss McGuire leans in from the secretaries' office.

                                     MISS MCGUIRE
                              (to Bock)
                         Doctor, did you ask the head nurse 
                         on the eighth floor to let you know 
                         when a Miss Drummond got there?

                                     BOCK
                         Yes.

                                     MISS MCGUIRE
                         Well, she just got there.

                                     BOCK
                         Thank you.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                              (on phone)
                         Oh, dear me, Dorothy. I better get 
                         right down there directly. Have you 
                         called the O.O.D.? And you better 
                         call Dr. Gilley. And you better call 
                         Mr. Sloan... Yes, I'll be down 
                         directly.
                              (hangs up; to Bock)
                         I'm very sorry, Doctor, but there's 
                         a real nasty one in the O.R. They've 
                         just operated on the wrong patient...

               O.R. NURSING SUPERVISOR'S OFFICE

               Crowded now. The administrative resident, Hitchcock, is here 
               and a uniformed man in his fifties, MR. SLOAN, the Chief of 
               Safety and Traffic. Sloan represents the Hospital's security 
               force. Mrs. Kimball is at her desk, on the phone.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                              (on phone)
                         ...well, I don't understand, is she 
                         back in her room? When did she get 
                         back to her room? Who brought her 
                         back?...
                              (she stares at 
                              Hitchcock)
                         She's back in her room.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Who?

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                         Mrs. Mangafranni, the woman who was 
                         supposed to have been operated on...
                              (calls to a nurse 
                              passing)
                         Are they still working on that woman 
                         in Three?

                                     NURSE
                         Yeah.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                              (back on phone)
                         I'm sorry, Mrs. Fried, would you say 
                         that again?... Well, nobody in this 
                         office sent her back up... Well, all 
                         right, Mrs. Fried, I'll have to call 
                         you back.

               She hangs up, stands, goes out into...

               THE OPERATING AREA, PLAZA

               ...where three orderlies lounge about.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                         Did any of you take a woman named 
                         Mangafranni out of the Holding Room 
                         back up to Holly Five around ten 
                         o'clock?

               Apparently, none of these three. Mrs. Christie turns in from 
               the outer corridor. Normal Operating Room activity flows by: 
               patients wheeled to and from their various surgeries, surgeons 
               checking the blackboard, staff doctors, orderlies keeping 
               the noise level low but steady.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                              (to Hitchcock in the 
                              doorway)
                         What happened?

               Hitchcock shrugs helplessly.

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                              (to Mrs. Christie)
                         I don't know what happened. A patient 
                         named Mangafranni was scheduled for 
                         a hysterectomy at ten o'clock -- Dr. 
                         Mallory. I talked to Sylvia in the 
                         Holding Room who admitted her, so 
                         she was here. And now I just spoke 
                         to Mrs. Fried on Holly Five, and she 
                         says an orderly brought Mrs. 
                         Mangafranni back to her room about 
                         twenty minutes ago. Now Mrs. 
                         Mangafranni is in her room sleeping.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Well, who's the woman in the operating 
                         room?

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                         I don't know.

               Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie, Hitchcock and Sloan push through 
               the glass doors to the crossroads of the operating rooms. 
               Through each window, we see operating crews hacking away.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Is she dead?

                                     MRS. KIMBALL
                         Well, they had to open her up, and 
                         that's not good.

               They gather in anticipation outside O.R. Three and peer over 
               each other's shoulders into the room where the operating 
               crew is hunched over the open-heart massage. The masked 
               circulating nurse looks up, notices the audience at the door, 
               and gives a hopeless shrug.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         I better get Mr. Mead.

               HOLLY PAVILION, THE STAFF ROOM

               Milton Mead is sitting in a back seat of the Staff Room -- a 
               lounge with couches, easy chairs and magazine racks -- gives 
               half an ear to the several opinions being simultaneously 
               expressed by:

                         staffed by women and administered by

                         ...let's get to the core of the matter 
                         which is the criminal and gangster 
                         collusion between the American medical 
                         establishment and the drug, insurance 
                         and tobacco companies who, through 
                         their combined racketeering efforts, 
                         have produced a dual system of health 
                         care. Everything for the rich and 
                         nothing for the poor!

                         tomorrow, but right now, for God's 
                         sake, can we get those people out of 
                         those buildings? Will you people 
                         please listen to me? Will you people 
                         please shut up and listen to me? 
                         Will you people please call a halt

                         address ourselves to the immediate 
                         problem?!

               During this maelstrom, the phone at Mead's elbow RINGS. Mead 
               answers it, listens, nods, returns the receiver, stand and 
               slips out of the room into the delicious silence of the...

               OPERATING ROOM THREE

               Dr. Mallory is wrenching off his blood-drenched rubber gloves 
               and flinging them to the floor in a rage. The door to the 
               room opens, and Mrs. Kimball, Mrs. Christie and Mr. Sloan 
               enter. Dr. Mallory is stupefied with anger. Dr. Chu, blessed 
               with Eastern containment, blandly gathers his equipment 
               together, nods to Mrs. Christie.

                                     DR. CHU
                         Good morning.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Good morning, Doctor.

                                     DR. CHU
                         This is really something, isn't it? 
                         I thought she looked a little 
                         different when they brought her in. 
                         I even said to one of the nurses, 
                         "She looks a little younger without 
                         her dentures." I'd only talked to 
                         her half an hour before.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Does anybody know who she is?

               Dr. Mallory can only stare at her numbly. He turns and stares 
               numbly at Mr. Sloan.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                              (to Mrs. Kimball, 
                              examining the chart 
                              dangling from the 
                              operating table)
                         What's her chart say?

                                     CIRCULATING RESIDENT
                         Her chart says Mangafranni. Her 
                         bracelet says Mangafranni. The only 
                         thing that isn't Mangafranni is the 
                         woman.

               Dr. Mallory finally explodes.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         Jesus H. Christ! I've been chopping 
                         out three uteruses a day for twenty 
                         years, and is it too much to expect 
                         for you people to bring in the right 
                         goddam Jesus Christ uterus?!

                                     DR. CHU
                         I had just been talking to her in 
                         the Holding Room. She was perfectly 
                         fine. A little drowsy. I thought it 
                         was funny that when they brought her 
                         in, she was out cold.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                              (shuffling around in 
                              aimless circles)
                         Jesus H. Kee-rist!

               Mrs. Christie stares down at the face of the dead patient on 
               the table, who has had her chest spread wide open so that 
               the organs are exposed.

                                     MRS. CHRISTIE
                         Well, we'll just all have to stay 
                         here until Mr. Mead or someone from 
                         the O.O.D. comes back.

                                     DR. MALLORY
                         Well, I'm not taking the rap for 
                         this! I've already got one malpractice 
                         suit pending, and I'm not taking the 
                         rap for this one!

               HOLLY PAVILION, ROOM

               William Mead's bed is empty. The Reverend Drummond's suit, 
               still on its hanger, is lying on it. Drummond himself lies 
               comatose and rigged out with I.V.s and catheters. Barbara 
               Drummond is packing her father's things into an open one-
               suiter valise. The door opens. She looks up. It's Bock. They 
               look at each other -- two people in love.

                                     BOCK
                         Look, you're not going. I love you, 
                         and I'm not going to let you go.

               He picks up the suit lying on the bed.

                                     BOCK
                         Come on, let's start putting your 
                         father's things back. He's staying 
                         here.
                              (hangs the suit in 
                              the closet)
                         I'll find an apartment somewhere. 
                         I'm staying in a filthy little hotel 
                         room. We can't use that.

               His eyes are caught by a white doctor's uniform hanging in 
               the armoire along with the suits and overcoats of the two 
               patients in the room. He bends over to peer at the nameplate 
               over the breast pocket.

                                     BARBARA
                         I can't make it here, Herb. I'll 
                         crack up. I cracked up once already. 
                         One week here, and I'd be running 
                         naked through the streets screaming 
                         again. I can retain my sanity only 
                         in a simple society.

                                     BOCK
                         For God's sake, Barbara, you can't 
                         seriously see me living in a grass 
                         shack hunting jackrabbits for dinner? 
                         Be sensible for God's sake.

                                     BARBARA
                         I am being sensible. What is it you're 
                         so afraid of leaving here? Your 
                         plastic home? Your conditioned air? 
                         Your synthetic clothes? Your instant 
                         food? I'm offering you green silence 
                         and solitude, the natural order of 
                         things. Mostly, I'm offering me. I 
                         think we're beautiful, Herb.

                                     BOCK
                              (utterly in love)
                         You make it sound almost plausible.

                                     BARBARA
                         I don't know why you even hesitate. 
                         What's holding you here? Is it your 
                         wife?

                                     BOCK
                         No, that's all over. I suppose if 
                         I'm married to anything, it's this 
                         hospital. It's been my whole life. I 
                         just can't walk out on it as if it 
                         never mattered. I'm middle-class. 
                         Among us middle-class, love doesn't 
                         triumph over all. Responsibility 
                         does.

                                     BARBARA
                         Herb, don't ask me to stay here with 
                         you, because I love you, and I will. 
                         And we'll both be destroyed.

               He turns to her again. They both look away.

                                     BARBARA
                         I've got the bill here to pay yet.

                                     BOCK
                         I'll come with you.

               She gathers her raincoat and goes. Bock follows her out into 
               the...

               HOLLY PAVILION, EIGHTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR

               ...where Dr. Joseph Lagerman, Head of Nephrology, perhaps 
               remembered from an earlier scene, has been waiting for Bock. 
               He joins them en route to the elevators.

                                     LAGERMAN
                         Herb, you asked me to find that 
                         dialysis nurse.

                                     BOCK
                         What dialysis nurse?

               Barbara has continued walking. Bock starts to follow her.

                                     BARBARA
                         I'll go pay the bill.

                                     LAGERMAN
                         The one who goofed on your patient, 
                         Drummond.

               Bock turns back to Lagerman.

                                     LAGERMAN
                         Well, her name is Theresa Campanella, 
                         but you are not going to believe 
                         this, Herb. She died on the operating 
                         table in O. R. Three about an hour 
                         ago.

               Barbara is disappearing into an elevator. Bock starts after 
               her, then turns back to Lagerman.

                                     BOCK
                         What do you mean, she died on the 
                         operating table in O.R. Three?

               They hurry down the corridor to the elevators.

                                     BOCK
                         You mean she was the one?

                                     LAGERMAN
                         That's the one. I just identified 
                         her.

                                     BOCK
                         What the hell's going on around here? 
                         Every time I try to find somebody in 
                         this hospital, they either died of a 
                         heart attack in Emergency or of 
                         anesthesia shock in an operating 
                         room.

               Elevator doors open. A nurse and visitor get out. Bock and 
               Lagerman go into...

               THE ELEVATOR

               Two or three people besides the elevator operator are there, 
               as well as a patient on a stretcher and an orderly.

                                     LAGERMAN
                         Listen, I just came from the O.R. 
                         They're trying to find a Dr. Schaefer. 
                         Don't you have a kid named Schaefer 
                         in your service?

                                     BOCK
                              (scowls, mutters)
                         I had a Schaefer. He died yesterday 
                         of an overdose of insulin. What do 
                         they want Schaefer for?

                                     LAGERMAN
                         The Holding Room nurse says there 
                         was a Dr. Schaefer hanging around 
                         the Holding Room. It wouldn't have 
                         been your Schaefer anyway. The nurse 
                         says it was senior staff, a middle-
                         aged man.

                                     BOCK
                         There's no senior staff named Schaefer 
                         in this hospital.

                                     LAGERMAN
                         I told them that. I said, I don't 
                         know any senior staff around here 
                         named Schaefer. They've got detectives 
                         down there, everything. It's a whole 
                         big investigation.

               The elevator stops at the seventh floor. The doors open and 
               Bock and Lagerman stroll into...

               HOLLY PAVILION, SEVENTH FLOOR, CORRIDOR

               Bock lumbers down the west corridor, turns into...

               ROOM 806

               William Mead, sedated and apparently zonked out cold, is 
               being transferred from a stretcher back into bed by an O.R. 
               orderly and nurse's aid. Bock rolls back the curtains around 
               Drummond's bed revealing the comatose patient, his face 
               sculptured against the white pillow, an I.V. tube in his 
               right arm, a catheter projecting from under the sheet. Bock 
               lowers the protective railing, leans in, takes the man's 
               pulse on his neck, raises one closed eyelid, then the other. 
               The pupils stare vacuously back at him; the eyelids drop 
               closed as soon as they are released.

               In the background, the orderly and aid finish tucking in 
               William Mead and exit, wheeling their creaking stretcher 
               out. The room is shockingly silent. Bock goes to the window 
               and frowns in thought.

               HOLD ACROSS the patient Drummond, on Bock in the background 
               at the window with his back to us. Suddenly, Drummond's eyes 
               open. He lies rigid, his eyes staring dementedly into the 
               air above him.

               Slowly, his left hand reaches out and carefully withdraws 
               the catheter from his bladder, lays it on the white sheet 
               beside him, and silently reaches over to withdraw the I.V. 
               needle from his right arm. He lets the needle dangle, dripping 
               onto the bed. Carefully, he twists out from under his sheet, 
               swings his legs over the side of the bed and sits up.

               REVERSE ACROSS Bock at the window, pondering. With a swift 
               lash of movement, the double tubes of a stethoscope are 
               whipped over his head and tightened around his throat.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (mad as a hatter)
                         I am the Fool for Christ and the 
                         Paraclete of Caborca.

               CLOSE TWO SHOT of Bock being strangled, Drummond's face frozen 
               in bland dementia behind him.

                                     BARBARA'S VOICE
                              (off-screen)
                         For heaven's sake, Dad! What the 
                         hell's going on?

               Drummond pauses in his strangling and, releasing the poor 
               man altogether, turns to his daughter in the doorway.

               CAMERA DOLLIES to include all three -- Bock recuperating; 
               Drummond staring madly; and Barbara infuriated with her 
               father.

                                     BARBARA
                              (annoyed)
                         We all thought you were at Death's 
                         Door! What're you doing out of bed?

               Drummond, abashed, stands there, a scolded schoolboy, a 
               rawboned figure in a hospital shift, a stethoscope dangling 
               from his right hand.

                                     BARBARA
                              (to Bock)
                         What happened? Did he say anything 
                         to you?

                                     BOCK
                              (sufficiently recovered)
                         As a matter of fact, he said, "I am 
                         the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete 
                         of Caborca." And you'd better close 
                         the door, because if he's going to 
                         tell everyone who walks in here he's 
                         the Fool for Christ and the Paraclete 
                         of Caborca, they'll put us all away. 
                         He's already killed two doctors and 
                         one nurse.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I am the wrath of the lamb and the 
                         angel of the bottomless pit.

                                     BARBARA
                         What do you mean he killed two doctors 
                         and a nurse?

                                     BOCK
                         I mean, he's killed two doctors and 
                         a nurse! And he just tried to kill 
                         me! He has something against doctors. 
                         Somehow he got hold of a thousand 
                         units of insulin and put it in Dr. 
                         Schaefer's intravenous solution. And 
                         somehow he got Dr. Ives to die of a 
                         heart attack in the middle of the 
                         Emergency Room. And somehow he got a 
                         dialysis nurse named Campanella to 
                         die of anesthesia shock on an 
                         operating table!
                              (opens the closet, 
                              points to the white 
                              doctor's uniform 
                              hanging there)
                         He's been running around the hospital 
                         wearing Dr. Schaefer's uniform. Right 
                         now, they're looking all over the 
                         place for this mysterious Dr. 
                         Schaefer. I know this all sounds as 
                         grotesque to you as it does to me, 
                         but you can see for yourself your 
                         father is not the helpless comatose 
                         patient we thought he was. Don't 
                         look at me like I'm the one who's 
                         crazy. Ask your crazy father!

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I was merely an instrument of God. I 
                         killed no one. They all three died 
                         by their own hands, ritual victims 
                         of their own institutions, murdered 
                         by irony, an eye for an eye, biblical 
                         retribution. Schaefer was first, you 
                         see, because he killed God. God was 
                         admitted to this hospital last Monday 
                         under the name of Guernsey...

               ROOM 806. MORNING. (FLASHBACK)

               A cheerless, gray sunlight fills the room as the fragile, 
               white-haired and bearded old Guernsey (whose admittance to 
               the hospital was the opening scene of the film) is being 
               helped into the room by Nurse Felicia Chile. She solicitously 
               helps the wispy old man off with his coat and jacket and hat 
               which she puts in the armoire. With palsied fingers, the 
               little old man unknots his stringy tie and unbuttons the 
               collar, which is three sizes too large. In the other bed, 
               Drummond's eyes slowly open.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         I was instantly aware of a divine 
                         presence.

               The old man is slipping out of his clothes to expose a thin 
               little body in a torn nightshirt.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         I was convinced this porcelain old 
                         man was, in fact, an Angel of the 
                         Lord...

               The old man sits back, wheezing a little. Nurse Chile smiles 
               nicely at him and takes her leave. For a moment, Drummond 
               lies rigidly on his bed, staring dully into the air and the 
               old man sits with his hunched back to us. The room is silent 
               except for his rheumy wheeze.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         ...perhaps even Christ Himself.

               After a moment, the old man rises and goes to the washbasin 
               and, with some wheezing, spits into it. He shuffles back to 
               bed. Dr. Schaefer comes into the room with a professional 
               smile and the patient Guernsey's chart.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         Our Savior was, it seems, suffering 
                         from emphysema.

               Schaefer perches on the bed beside Guernsey and begins to 
               take his history.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         He was relentlessly subjected to the 
                         benefits of modern medicine. He was 
                         misdiagnosed, mismedicated, and put 
                         into shock by Dr. Schaefer; raced 
                         off to Intensive Care, where the 
                         resident compounded the blunder and 
                         induced a coma. I can tell you with 
                         authority that God is indeed dead. 
                         He died last Monday under the name 
                         of Guernsey.

               CLOSE-UP of Drummond in deep shadow shows him sleeping.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         A few hours later, he appeared to me 
                         in a revelation.

               ROOM 806. NIGHT, 7:00 P.M.

               The room is lit only by the yellow light from the half-opened 
               bathroom door. Guernsey walks out of the shadows, hands 
               raised. He shuffles to Drummond's bedside and looks down on 
               him from his frail height.

                                     GUERNSEY
                              (softly)
                         Rise up, Drummond. You are dead, now 
                         you are restored.

               Drummond's eyes open and roll to the direction of the voice.

               DRUMMOND'S P.O.V.: Guernsey, dressed only in his hospital 
               shift, is shuffling up and down the aisle of the room, hands 
               clasped behind his back like a Mittel-European intellectual, 
               head hunched forward -- a little old man with a white beard 
               talking to himself.

                                     GUERNSEY
                         Those who killed you and those who 
                         killed me will die in our place. You 
                         are the Paraclete of Caborca, the 
                         wrath of the lamb. The angel of the 
                         bottomless pit.

               Guernsey closes his eyes in religious ecstacy.

                                     GUERNSEY
                         In this fashion has it been revealed 
                         to you.

               Drummond starts to sob and slowly sits up in his bed, imbued 
               with belief. He looks mutely up at the frail old man, who 
               now raises his right hand and his face is transfigured into 
               vast majesty.

                                     GUERNSEY
                              (thunders out)
                         The age is closed! The end is at 
                         hand! The seal is broken!

               So saying, he reverts to the little old man he was, wheezing 
               a bit, and with some effort, climbs back on his bed and lies 
               there, eyes closed. His thin, high nose projects from the 
               whiteness of his face. He sighs the rattling last sigh of 
               life and dies. CAMERA DOLLIES slowly to CLOSE-UP of Drummond 
               lying motionless on his bed. His eyes are wide, glinting in 
               the shadows, a man imbued. His cheeks are wet with tears of 
               exaltation.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         Well! Not quite the burning bush 
                         perhaps but prodigal enough for me. 
                         I was to avenge the death of God and 
                         my own brutalization. I was to kill 
                         Doctors Schaefer, Ives and Welbeck 
                         and the dialysis nurse Miss 
                         Campanella, whose negligence caused 
                         my coma.

               FULL SHOT of Drummond. He raises his left hand, flexing his 
               fingers. Then he moves his other arm, his head, his shoulders. 
               Obviously, he is regaining his faculties.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         I awaited a further sign from God, 
                         which was given to me later that 
                         evening. Dr. Schaefer, it seems, had 
                         arranged an assignation with a girl 
                         from the hematology lab named Sheila.

               ACROSS Drummond to the now empty other bed. All the lights 
               are on. PAN on Nurse Penny Canduso and an orderly wheeling 
               away the wrapped body of Guernsey. Intern Schaefer, at the 
               door, considers the empty bed with interest. Moving to the 
               bedtable, he picks up the receiver of the phone.

                                     SCHAEFER
                              (on phone)
                         Hey Sheila, this is Howard, Sheila. 
                         Hey listen, I got us a bed for 
                         tonight. A real, honest-to-god bed.

               ROOM 806. NIGHT

               REPRISE the scene originally played UNDER CREDITS where Dr. 
               Schaefer and his girlfriend Sheila sneak into the room and 
               undress. Giggles and shushings, gooses and fondles.

                                     SHEILA
                         Boy, I sure hope nobody walks in.

               During the replay, however, an additional segment is added. 
               At one point, the girl, hanging her dress in the armoire, 
               turns and holds something up.

                                     SHEILA
                         What's this in your pocket?

                                     SCHAEFER
                         That's my insulin. Put it back.

                                     SHEILA
                         What do you take insulin for? 
                         Diabetes? I didn't know you were a 
                         diabetic.

                                     SCHAEFER
                         It ain't contagious, don't worry 
                         about it.

               They head for the unoccupied bed. CLOSE-UP on Drummond's 
               profile.

               ROOM 806

               Dark, hushed. Schaefer's girl is leaving; she tiptoes to the 
               door, peeks out. Apparently, the coast is clear. She quickly 
               slips out.

               ROOM 806. DAY

               Drummond on his chair. Barbara perched on one side of her 
               father's bed, Bock on the other. William Mead sleeps on.

                                     BOCK
                         And you put Schaefer's insulin into 
                         the I.V. jar.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Yes. And then a second nurse came 
                         and plugged the I.V. jar into 
                         Schaefer. God clearly intended a 
                         measure of irony here. The hospital 
                         was to do all the killing for me. 
                         All I need do was arrange for the 
                         doctors to become patients in their 
                         own hospital. Accordingly, the next 
                         morning, I set out for Dr. Ives. I 
                         put on Dr. Schaefer's uniform, pinched 
                         some digoxine from the pharmacy and 
                         a sandbag from a utility cart, and 
                         found my way to Dr. Ives' laboratory. 
                         I coshed him with the sandbag, gave 
                         him a massive shot of the digoxine. 
                         This, you see, brought on an instant 
                         condition of cardiac arrhythmia. 
                         When he came to, I brought him down 
                         to the Emergency Room.

               EMERGENCY ROOM AREA, LOBBY. DAY

               The usual E.R. crush and motion goes on in the background. 
               Drummond escorts an obviously ill Dr. Ives to the Admitting 
               Room. Drummond's voice under the narration explains matters 
               to Miss Aronovici at the desk.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         This is Dr. Ives. He's in the 
                         Nephrology Lab. I was in there a 
                         little while ago, and he was suddenly 
                         taken ill, and I thought I'd better 
                         get him over here right away.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         He had at that time perhaps an hour 
                         to live. Prompt treatment would have 
                         saved his life.

               They go into the...

               EMERGENCY ADMITTING AND TREATMENT ROOMS

               Ives, seated on a table in evident distress, breathes heavily.

                              (voice-off)
                         As a staff doctor, he was seen without 
                         preliminaries...

               An attendant takes his pulse, pressure and respiration. Ives 
               collapses.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (voice-off)
                         His vital signs were taken, an 
                         electrocardiogram...

               PAN SLOWLY across the Emergency Room to catch its state of 
               contained febrility. Every curtained treatment room is 
               occupied, including the storage room in the back. The triage 
               nurse and a second nurse behind the desk are busy on the 
               phones. The triage nurse takes the history of the first in a 
               line of five people seeking admission even as she answers 
               her phone.

               We watch Miss Aronovici and the other nurse and Dr. Spezio 
               and his two interns, the two attendants -- all busy with one 
               patient or another.

                         ventricular premature contractions.

               ACROSS Drummond, white-uniformed, standing in the back against 
               the filing cabinets and linens, watching the the new patients 
               trickle and crowd in.

                         ...and then he was promptly...

               At the Admitting Desk, a MAN in his forties is being signed 
               in by a uniformed cop.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (voice-off)
                         ...simply... forgotten to death. 
                         Simply mislaid...

               CAMERA JUST STARES at the pageant of pain.

                                     DRUMMOND

                         ...mislaid among the broken wrists, 
                         the chest pains, scalp lacerations, 
                         the man whose fingers were crushed 
                         in a taxi door, the infant with the

                         car, the old lady mugged in the 
                         subway, the derelict beaten by 
                         sailors, the teenage suicide, the

               Looking to the street doors as two ambulance attendants, 
               bearing a seventeen-year-old black girl on a stretcher, burst 
               in.

               ...which is already galvanized into action. Miss Aronovici 
               is at the girl's pulse even as she is being transferred to 
               the bed that has just been cleared of Mr. Mitgang and his 
               concussion case.

                              year-old girl)
                         She's taking a little pulse.

               On screen we continue watching the scene of the overdose 
               case treatment, as the live-action sound in the room fades 
               behind Drummond's tale.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)

                         hemorrhages, concussions, boils, 
                         abrasions, the colonic cancers, the 
                         cardiac arrests -- the whole wounded 
                         madhouse of our times...

               REACTION SHOT of Drummond staring at this ceaseless panorama 
               of pain, tears streaking down his cheeks.

                         I wonder if I could have a minute of 
                         your time, Doctor...

               Drummond turns to the voice. CAMERA PULLS BACK to include 
               the man who had been brought into the E.R. by a uniformed 
               cop.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I am the fool for Christ and the 
                         Paraclete of Caborca.

                                     NAMELESS MAN
                         Well, it's an honor and a privilege, 
                         Doctor. I've been here ten minutes, 
                         I can't seem to get anybody to help 
                         me. I'm suffering from some sort of 
                         amnesia. I can't remember my name. 
                         As a matter of fact, it's pretty 
                         screwy. I got mugged. Two hours ago, 
                         walking out of a coffee shop on Fifty-
                         Seventh Street and Second Avenue, 
                         eight o'clock in the morning, broad 
                         daylight, I got mugged. A sixteen-
                         year-old girl walks up to me, shows 
                         me a knife about a yard long and 
                         says, "Give me your wallet." I thought 
                         she was kidding. I mean there's 
                         hundreds of people walking right by. 
                         Well, she wasn't kidding. "Listen," 
                         I said, "all I got's about twenty 
                         bucks." So she takes the wallet 
                         anyway. So I said, "How about leaving 
                         me my identification?" I mean, I had 
                         my driver's license, my Diner's Club, 
                         my credit cards. But she took them 
                         all, the whole damn wallet, credit 
                         cards, everything. So I stopped some 
                         guy, I said, "Hey, you see that girl 
                         there, walking away?" He says, "Yeah." 
                         I said, "She just stole my wallet, 
                         credit cards and everything." He 
                         says, "Well, that's what they want, 
                         the credit cards." So I started 
                         looking for a cop. I mean, go find a 
                         cop, right? Well, I finally find a 
                         cop. The girl's halfway to South 
                         America by now, probably bought the 
                         ticket with my credit cards. So the 
                         cop says, "What's your name?" And 
                         you want to know something? I couldn't 
                         think of my name. The girl took all 
                         my identification, you know what I 
                         mean? She took all my credit cards. 
                         So I said, "You know this is screwy. 
                         I can't think of my name." So he 
                         took me to the station house. The 
                         sergeant says, "What's your name?" I 
                         said, "I don't know! She took all my 
                         credit cards!" So they took me down 
                         here. So what do you think, Doctor? 
                         I'm nuts, right? I finally flipped.

               PAN SLOWLY to Drummond who stares at the Nameless Man.

               In BACKGROUND the door opens and Mrs. Cushing, the lady from 
               accounting, enters. She calls out in her annoying voice from 
               a chart.

                                     MRS. CUSHING
                         Who's number 7-6-8-0-2-S? Is there 
                         anybody here who is that number?

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (off-screen)
                         In this way was it revealed to me 
                         the manner of Nurse Campanella's 
                         death. She was to die of the great 
                         American plague -- vestigial identity.

               RETURN FROM FLASHBACK:

               ROOM 806. DAY

               Drummond in his hospital shift, gaunt and mad as a prophet, 
               sits rigidly on his chair. Barbara perches on her father's 
               bed. Bock wanders disorientedly about the room, staring 
               incredulously first at Barbara and then at her father.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         So last night, I coshed Miss 
                         Campanella with a sandbag, sedated 
                         her with thorazine, shaved her, 
                         prepped her, and parked her in a 
                         corridor of the X-Ray Department for 
                         five hours.

                                     BOCK
                         Why X-Ray?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Well, at X-Ray, a sedated body lying 
                         around unattended for five hours 
                         wouldn't seem unusual.

                                     BOCK
                         Of course.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Her operation -- that is to say, 
                         Mrs. Mangafranni's operation -- was 
                         not scheduled until nine-thirty. So 
                         at nine-fifteen this morning, I rang 
                         for my nurse...

                                     BOCK
                         You rang for your nurse?

                                     DRUMMOND
                         To insure one full hour of 
                         uninterrupted privacy.

                                     BOCK
                         Oh yes.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I got up, wheeled Miss Campanella 
                         off to the operating rooms, replaced 
                         her bed with Mrs. Mangafranni's, 
                         exchanged charts and identity 
                         bracelets. She died officially of 
                         anesthesia shock. But, in point of 
                         fact, she died because she was wearing 
                         another woman's identity.

                                     BARBARA
                              (to Bock)
                         God, what do we do now? Let me take 
                         him back to Mexico. It's a simple 
                         world there. If you turn him in, 
                         they'll just cage him in the Rockland 
                         State Hospital for the Criminally 
                         Insane. Let me take him back, Herb.

                                     BOCK
                         Are you kidding? We'll both take 
                         him. I'm going with you! Get him 
                         dressed. We're getting out of here 
                         before the police put us all in 
                         Rockland State.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         I haven't finished my work here. I 
                         have this Welbeck to dispose of. I 
                         am the angel of the bottomless pit 
                         and the wrath of the lamb.

                                     BARBARA
                         Oh dear, he's having another 
                         revelation.

               Bock holds Drummond's coat and hat and crosses to take his 
               arm. He finds the entranced Drummond as rigid as a statue.

                                     BOCK
                         Look, that ambulance must be here by 
                         now. You go down and get them. I'll 
                         give him a shot of something to knock 
                         him out. We'll take him to the airport 
                         in the ambulance.

               They both hurry out of the room. Drummond remains enmarbled 
               in his trance. CAMERA SUDDENLY MOVES DOWN to William Mead, 
               whose eyes now open; he has heard it all. In background, 
               Drummond, suddenly released from his catatonic trance, heads 
               for the armoire and extracts the white trousers of Dr. 
               Schaefer's uniform. He puts them on, tucking in the tails of 
               his hospital shift. He notices William Mead staring at him.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         You're hallucinating again.

               William Mead just stares at Drummond.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, NURSES' STATION AND LOBBY AREA

               Bock and Barbara come hurrying around the corner from the 
               west corridor. Barbara heads for the elevators. Bock heads 
               for the Nurses' Station. The Eighth Floor is going about its 
               normal 1:15 P.M. activity. Mrs. Donovan is at her desk on 
               the phone.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         ...Edwards never showed up. I'm short-
                         staffed as hell. It's just me and 
                         Felicia. It's like Sunday. Nobody's 
                         here.

                                     DR. BIEGELMAN
                         I'll be at lunch...

               A nurse's aid, a bathrobed patient and two of his visitors 
               stroll by. It's the end of the lunch hour, when the kitchen 
               workers bring used trays back.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         Yeah, you gotta send me somebody... 
                         Oh yeah?

               Bock moves past Mrs. Donovan and into the pharmacy where we 
               see him scouring the shelves for thorazine and a syringe. An 
               elevator arrives, disgorging Milton Mead and his resident 
               assistant, Thomas Hitchcock and, of all people, Dr. Richard 
               Welbeck himself. Barbara and Dr. Biegelman go into the 
               elevator. The doors close. Milton Mead and Hitchcock head 
               for the west corridor. Welbeck, in his natty double-breasted 
               suit and carrying his cashmere coat, heads straight for the 
               Nurses' Station.

                                     MEAD
                         We'll be in Eight-O-Six.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                              (chuckles into phone)
                         ...then what did she say?

                                     WELBECK
                              (to Mrs. Donovan)
                         I'm Dr. Welbeck. I have a patient on 
                         this floor named Drummond, and I'd 
                         like to see his chart.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         I'll call you back.

               Bock immediately emerges from the pharmacy holding a bottle 
               of thorazine and a wrapped hypodermic syringe. He scowls at 
               Welbeck, who scowls back.

                                     WELBECK
                         Oh, Dr. Bock. Can I have a few minutes 
                         of your time, sir?

                                     BOCK
                         No.

               He starts to pass Mrs. Donovan and would continue, but Welbeck 
               lays a restraining hand on his arm.

                                     WELBECK
                         Dr. Gilley tells me you're the one 
                         who initiated these proceedings 
                         against me.

                                     BOCK
                         I'm busy, Welbeck.

                                     WELBECK
                         I'd like to know what you have against 
                         me.

                                     BOCK
                         You turned up half-stoned for a simple 
                         nephrectomy eight days ago, botched 
                         it, put the patient into failure and 
                         damn near killed him. Then, pausing 
                         only to send in your bill, you flew 
                         off on the wings of man to an island 
                         of sun in Montego Bay. This is the 
                         third time in two years we've had to 
                         patch up your patients; the other 
                         two died. You're greedy, unfeeling, 
                         inept, indifferent, self-inflating 
                         and unconscionably profitable. Aside 
                         from that, I have nothing against 
                         you. I'm sure you play a hell of a 
                         game of golf. What else do you want 
                         to know?

               Welbeck's pocket-beeper BEEPS.

                                     WELBECK
                         Excuse me for a moment, Doctor.
                              (he reaches over the 
                              nurses' desk for a 
                              phone)
                         This is Dr. Welbeck. Were you paging 
                         me?
                              (regarding Bock with 
                              cold scorn)
                         How much do you make a year, Bock? 
                         For a guy who makes a lousy forty, 
                         fifty grand...
                              (on phone)
                         Hello, Arthur, I understand you've 
                         been trying to reach me all morning...

               Bock turns and heads back for...

               EIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR

               ...and down that through the kitchen workers and strolling 
               patients to...

               ROOM 806

               ...which he enters. He is startled to find Milton Mead and 
               Hitchcock leaning over William Mead, who is up on one elbow 
               and in a state.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         I'm telling you, Milton, he pulls 
                         out all the wires and the tubes, and 
                         he gets up and puts on a doctor's 
                         uniform, and he goes out, and he 
                         murders doctors! He just went out 
                         ten seconds before you came in!

               Indeed, there is no Drummond to be seen. His bed is empty. 
               Bock nods to Milton Mead and Hitchcock, who nod back, and 
               crosses quickly to look into the bathroom which is likewise 
               empty.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         And I'll tell you something else 
                         about this crazy place you got here! 
                         There was a naked Indian in here 
                         last night doing a war dance! That's 
                         the kind of crazy place you're running 
                         here, Milton! You got to get me out 
                         of here, Milton. This is a crazy 
                         place, Milton!

               Milton Mead's pocket-beeper BEEPS. Milton Mead reaches for 
               the phone.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                              (appealing to Bock)
                         I wake up last night, there's a goddam 
                         Indian in here, a naked Indian! What 
                         kind of hospital is this?

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (on phone)
                         This is Mr. Mead, are you paging me?

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         A couple of hours later I wake up 
                         again, and the guy in that bed there 
                         is getting out of the bed...

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (to Hitchcock)
                         Are the police still in the building?

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Yes.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         You'd better get them up here. Yes.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         All day long, he lays there like a 
                         dead man. All of a sudden, in the 
                         middle of the night, he gets out of 
                         bed! I thought I was going crazy!

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (on phone)
                         Yes, this is Mead... Oh, dear. 
                         When?...

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         You know what he says to me? He says, 
                         you're hallucinating. Listen, I just 
                         saw a naked Indian. Now, I'm seeing 
                         a ghost. I got to figure he's right, 
                         I'm hallucinating, right?

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         I'll be down directly.
                              (hangs up)
                         Never rains but it pours. A fire 
                         just broke out in one of those 
                         condemned buildings. The squatters 
                         in the building came out. The police 
                         tried to arrest them and, apparently, 
                         the situation has erupted into a 
                         riot.
                              (to Bock as he heads 
                              for the door)
                         I'm sure you're wondering what this 
                         is all about, Herb.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         You're not going to leave me alone 
                         in this crazy place, Milton!

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (at the door with 
                              Bock)
                         Mr. Hitchcock is staying with you.
                              (to Hitchcock)
                         You better call the cops, Tom.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         Milton! Milton! Milton!!!

               The door slams.

               WEST CORRIDOR AND NURSES' STATION

               Bock and Milton Mead stride up the corridor through the linen 
               wagons and kitchen carts.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                         I haven't the time now, and I'm not 
                         even going to try to tell you this 
                         curious story my brother just told 
                         me. I'll fill you in on it at lunch 
                         some time.

               He waves his hand helplessly to indicate the utter incredulity 
               of it all.

                                     MILTON MEAD
                              (rushes not to miss 
                              the elevator)
                         Hold it!

               They reach an open elevator. Mead goes in, the doors close. 
               The doors of a second elevator then open, and Barbara comes 
               out. She and Bock stare at each other. In background, Welbeck 
               is on the phone at the Nurses' Station.

                                     BARBARA
                         The ambulance is here.

                                     BOCK
                         Yeah, but your father isn't. He's 
                         disappeared. He put on Schaefer's 
                         uniform and has gone out to do God's 
                         work, presumably the murder of Dr. 
                         Welbeck. Except, that fellow on the 
                         phone over there is Dr. Welbeck.

                                     WELBECK

                              phone)
                         Oh my God, Arthur! What are you 
                         talking about? Have you talked to 
                         Dr. Hogan about this?

                                     BOCK
                         And, on top of everything else, the 
                         other patient in your father's room 
                         overheard his whole confession and 
                         just told the Chief Administrator of 
                         the hospital. They're sending for 
                         the cops.

               REVERSE ACROSS Welbeck on phone at Nurses' Station. In the 
               background, Bock and Barbara stare at him.

                                     WELBECK
                              (almost apoplectic on 
                              phone)
                         Oh, my God, Arthur. Well, who held 
                         title? Do the underwriters know about 
                         this yet?... Oh my God! Arthur, 
                         what're you waiting for? Arrest the 
                         son of a bitch! Turn him in!... Oh 
                         my God! When?... Of course, Arthur, 
                         call me right back. I'm at the Holly 
                         Pavilion, Eighth Floor. Please! Right 
                         away!

               He hangs up.

                                     BOCK
                         Are you all right, Welbeck?

                                     WELBECK
                         All right?! That son of a bitch is 
                         trying to wipe me out! My partner, 
                         the eminent orthopedic surgeon, Dr. 
                         Noel Hogan, is a miserable thief. 
                         And he's trying to wipe me out!

                                     MRS. DONOVAN

                              (angrily seizes the 
                              chart)
                         What room is it?

                         Eight-O-Six.

                                     WELBECK
                         I'm expecting a phone call. Put it 
                         straight through to me in that room.

               He strides off angrily, followed by an anxious Bock and 
               Barbara, for the...

               EIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR

               Bock and Barbara hurry along in Welbeck's wake.

                                     WELBECK
                         The son of a bitch has been draining 
                         the company with phony purchase orders 
                         on another company, of which, it now 
                         turns out, his wife is the principal 
                         stockholder! Transparent fraud! I'll 
                         send him up for twenty years!

               He wrenches open the door of 806, marches in, followed by 
               Bock and Barbara.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, ROOM

               Welbeck advances on William Mead's bed, since he is the only 
               patient in the room. (Hitchcock is on the phone.)

                                     WELBECK
                         Well, Drummond, you don't seem that 
                         much the worse for the wear.

               William Mead stares dully at Welbeck. Then he looks dully at 
               Bock.

                                     WELBECK
                              (to Hitchcock)
                         Would you mind using some other phone? 
                         I'm expecting an important call.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         What is this? Who... who is this 
                         guy?

                                     HITCHCOCK
                              (on phone)
                         Yes, well, I'll be at the Nurses' 
                         Desk, Sergeant. It would be futile 
                         for me to try to explain this to you 
                         over the phone.

                                     WELBECK
                              (leafing through 
                              Drummond's chart)
                         You've got a bit of fever, Drummond, 
                         but you're coming along very well.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         I'm not Drummond, you monkey! 
                         Drummond's the other bed!

               The phone now BUZZES. Welbeck and Hitchcock both head for 
               it.

                                     WELBECK
                         That's mine.
                              (on phone)
                         It's Welbeck here... Yes, Arthur, go 
                         ahead...

               William Mead is painfully trying to get off his bed.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         I'm getting out of this nuthouse!

                              (pushing him gently 
                              back)
                         All right, take it easy, Mr. Mead.

               Hitchcock, satisfied the call is not for him, exits.

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                         I came in here just to get a lousy 
                         polyp cut out.

                                     WELBECK
                              (on phone)
                         Oh, my God, what do you mean? How 
                         many transactions were there? Bu... 
                         but Arthur, I... I borrowed against 
                         that stock! I'm in the hole for over 
                         three hundred thousand!...

                                     WILLIAM MEAD
                              (appealing to the 
                              gods)
                         I'm a sick man! I'm supposed to have 
                         peace and quiet!

                                     WELBECK
                              (on phone and 
                              apoplectic)
                         What do you mean, Brazil?! I just 
                         spoke to Hogan's office yesterday, 
                         and they just told me...

               The phone slips from his fingers. He turns to stare at Bock 
               and Barbara.

                                     WELBECK
                         I'm wiped out. The S.E.C. has 
                         suspended trading in my stock!

               He keels over like a felled tree, falling face-up on 
               Drummond's bed, his legs dangling to the floor. William Mead 
               promptly hides his head under his sheet.

               Bock moves quickly to the prostrate Welbeck, feels his throat 
               for the carotid pulse, pulls out his stethoscope, rips 
               Welbeck's shirt open, and listens for heartsounds. He picks 
               up the dangling telephone receiver, gets a dial tone.

                                     BOCK

               Barbara strips off her coat. She is still in nurse's uniform. 
               She leans into the hall and calls a passing nurse.

                                     BARBARA
                         We have an emergency here.

                              (rips off Welbeck's 
                              natty jacket)
                         Breathe him.

               Barbara helps Bock get Welbeck's dead weight onto the floor. 
               On his knees, Bock straddles Welbeck's prone form, balls his 
               fist and belts Welbeck on his chest. He begins intensive 
               heart massage. Barbara gets down on her knees, opens Welbeck's 
               mouth and commences mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In the 
               background, the P.A. system blandly echoes:

                         corridors.

               Mrs. Donovan and aides move C.A.C. into the room, immediately 
               followed by Intern Chandler rushing past them.

                                     MRS. DONOVAN

                         Natch. Get that other bed out of 
                         here.

               William Mead, of course, is still huddled under his sheet. 
               He peers out from under his covers in wide-eyed disbelief 
               and ducks under again. Bock massages Welbeck's heart. Barbara 
               continues mouth-to-mouth. Nurse Felicia Chile hurries in, 
               pushing the emergency cart before her.

               Nurse Chile has shunted the emergency cart aside to let the

               lower shelf.

               Nurse Chile hands the Berman airway and ambu bag to Barbara, 
               who inserts the airway and the ambu tube into Welbeck's mouth 
               and pumps in air by hand. Bock massages away.

               EIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR

               Mrs. Donovan and Intern Chandler finally get Mead and his 
               bed out into the corridor where they park it. In background, 
               emergency activity on all sides. The resident cardiologist, 
               DR. GEOFFREY MORSE, and anesthesiologist, DR. LAWRENCE LOOMIS, 
               both thirty-three, come hurtling around the corner.

                         Yeah.

               She follows Morse in as, from the lobby corner, two 
               technicians come racing a max cart and an I.V. stand before 
               them. Behind them, a bewildered Hitchcock moves into view, 
               trying to determine what's going on.

                         arrest.

               Hitchcock looks down at the sheeted figure hunched on the 
               bed parked in the hallway and slowly pulls the sheet off his 
               head. William Mead stares up at him like a hunted animal. 
               Hitchcock covers Mead's head again.

               ROOM 806

               Bock still massages, sweating bullets by now. Barbara works 
               the ambu bag. Dr. Morse is feeling Welbeck's groin for his 
               femoral pulse.

                         heartbeat, no respiration...

               If we can see anything of Welbeck through other bodies, we 
               notice almost all his clothes have been ripped off his body. 
               Dr. Loomis replaces Barbara.

                                     DR. LOOMIS
                         All right, I'll take over.

               The two nursing supervisors have been getting the max cart 
               ready, snapping up the gateleg-footrest and attaching the 
               I.V. tube to the oxygen jar, and that to the ambu bag.

                                     BOCK
                         Endotrachial tube.

                              (rushing in background 
                              with others)
                         I'm sorry, Doctor, but we have another 
                         emergency in 823.

                                     CHANDLER
                         Endotrachial tube.

                                     DR. LOOMIS
                         Shall we get him up on the cart?

                                     DR. MORSE
                         Yeah.

               Drs. Loomis, Bock and Morse struggle to lift the the nearly 
               naked dead weight of Dr. Welbeck up from the floor and onto 
               the max cart. Dr. Morse has picked up Drummond's chart from 
               the bed where Welbeck had left it.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         All right, who is this patient? What's 
                         the story on this patient?

               CLOSE-UP of Bock trying to hoist Welbeck and looking up 
               slowly.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         Is this his chart, Dr. Bock?

               Bock cocks his head to him.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         What's his name? Drummond?

               Bock looks across to Barbara, now helping out at the max 
               cart. She looks back at Bock. She shrugs. He shrugs. They 
               exchange a smile.

                                     BOCK
                         Yes, his name's Drummond. That's his 
                         chart.

               Straining under the effort, the three doctors get Welbeck 
               off the floor.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (studying the chart)
                         Oh Christ, the poor son of a bitch 
                         just had a nephrectomy a week ago.

               Mrs. Donovan exits into...

               EIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR

               ...as Mrs. Donovan comes out, Hitchcock turns to her.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Was it Drummond?

                                     MRS. DONOVAN
                         Who else would it be?

               Hitchcock silently thanks God.

               ROOM 806

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (off-screen)
                         Pick him up. Put him on it. Stop the 
                         massage.

               Welbeck's body is finally on the max cart. Nurses and doctors 
               converge on him. Dr. Loomis sets about intubating Welbeck, 
               and the Nursing Supervisor begins clamping the metal bands 
               of the E.K.G. machine on each of Welbeck's extremities.

               While all this goes on, Bock and Barbara have picked up the 
               remnants of Welbeck's jacket, trousers, shirt and underwear. 
               Dr. Morse is squatting by the max-cart reading the E.K.G. 
               script as it rolls slowly out of the cart.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         Ventricular fibrillation. Get me the 
                         paddles. Push another amp of bicarb.

               The Nursing Supervisor starts applying electrode paste to 
               the defibrillating paddles. Another nurse measures off an 
               ampule of bicarbonate of soda which Dr. Loomis injects into 
               the I.V. tube.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         Set it for two hundred.

               Barbara unsnaps her father's valise and stuffs Welbeck's 
               garments in it. Bock takes Welbeck's coat and piles Drummond's 
               things on top of that.

               The Nursing Supervisor hands Dr. Morse the defibrillating 
               paddles to place on Welbeck's left breast.

                                     NURSE
                              (off-screen)
                         That's two hundred.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         Everybody bock away.

               All back away from the max-cart. Bock and Barbara are at the 
               window, piled up with valise and coats; they look like they're 
               off for Europe.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (off-screen)
                         One-two-three...

               He pushes the defibrillating button, sending an electric 
               shock through Welbeck's body so as to bounce it into the 
               air.

               Bock and Barbara remain at the window with heart-resuscitation 
               team in background. Barbara slips into her own coat, in 
               preparation for escape.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (in background)
                         Did he convert?

                                     DR. LOOMIS
                              (in background)
                         No, he's still fibrillating.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (in background)
                         Let's go to four hundred.

                                     BARBARA
                              (sotto voce to Bock)
                         What do we do now?

               Bock is staring out the window. Barbara stares out with him.

               THEIR P.O.V.: looking down onto the U-shaped drive of the 
               entrance plaza of the hospital and First Avenue full of 
               traffic. A band of some fifty black and Puerto Rican youths, 
               including females and young white revolutionaries, most in 
               Che Guevara garb, have broken past the security guards at 
               the gates and spill across the drive. Some policemen and 
               security guards move tentatively out of the hospital to 
               intercept them.

               The shouting can't be heard from up here. Off-screen we hear 
               the activities of the resuscitation team.

                                     NURSING SUPERVISOR
                              (off-screen)
                         It's four hundred.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (off-screen)
                         Everybody back One-two-three...

               SOUND of the shock.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (off-screen)
                         That didn't work either.

               FIRST AVENUE. HIGH SHOT

               Low crowd noises. Bock looks out the window at the protesting 
               mob below.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (off-screen)
                         All right. Let me have a c.c. of 
                         Adrenaline and intercardiac needle.

               CAMERA PANS SLOWLY UP over the melee in the plaza to the 
               fence. Barbara and Bock stare down at the crowd.

                                     DR. MORSE
                              (off-screen)
                         Stop the massage. Ventricular 
                         fibrillation. Put another amp of 
                         bicarb. Two hundred.

               ZOOM DOWN into the maelstrom to FULL SHOT of the Reverend 
               Drummond dressed in Schaefer's white uniform, standing on 
               the slim island separating the uptown traffic from the 
               downtown traffic. Drummond is a private island of his own, 
               hands stretched to the skies. He is prophesying.

                                     DRUMMOND
                              (barely audible above 
                              the traffic rumbling 
                              heedlessly around 
                              him)
                         Let those who are in Judea flee to 
                         the mountains, for the age is closed, 
                         the season of the seventh seal is at 
                         hand!

               ROOM 806

               Bock and Barbara slip through doctors and nurses, heading 
               for the door.

                                     DR. MORSE
                         Hang isopril, two in five hundred. 
                         Let's take one more crack with the 
                         paddles. Everybody back off the cart.

               Bock, carrying two overcoats, and Barbara, wearing hers and 
               carrying her father's valise, exit into...

               EIGHTH FLOOR, WEST CORRIDOR

               ...as Bock and Barbara come out, the activity is normal, 
               with the exception of William Mead's bed along the wall. 
               Hitchcock and two overcoated men are in the hallway, and 
               Hitchcock hurries to Bock.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Is he dead?

                                     BOCK
                         They can't get him out of fib. I 
                         don't think he'll make it.

                                     HITCHCOCK
                         Thank God.
                              (sighs, turns to the 
                              two detectives)
                         This should close the case, Sergeant.

               Bock and Barbara hurry toward the elevators.

               THE HOSPITAL, HOLLY PAVILION, LOBBY

               The small army of militants and activists has broken through 
               the security into the lobby. Their entrance is greeted by 
               one small scream from a woman in the lobby. A LEADER of the 
               invading troop calls out.

                                     LEADER
                         Everybody take it easy! Nobody's 
                         going to be hurt! We just want the 
                         Director!

               Others in the troop shout reassurances, but it doesn't really 
               reassure anybody. The lady in the gift shop closes her door 
               and locks up. People crowd in a solid block in the doorway 
               to the coffee shop to see what's going on.

               From the long tunnels of corridors, nurses, doctors, 
               administrative personnel pause in their chores and errands 
               and missions to watch the tide of events in the lobby.

               HOLLY PAVILION, EXECUTIVE CORRIDOR

               The exit door is wrenched open, and Bock comes hurtling into 
               the carpeted executive corridor toward the lobby, and at 
               that moment the troop of militants come rumbling in from the 
               other end. Every door of the corridor fills with secretaries 
               and administrators unsure of what's happening. Then, Sundstrom 
               elbows his way through the clutch of secretaries in his 
               doorway and comes into the corridor. He regards the militants 
               moving down the corridor toward him.

                         So now we're going to arrest you. 
                         We're going to hold you hostage and 
                         we ain't letting you go un...

               Ambler, the medical student we met during Bock's teaching 
               rounds, pushes in front of the Leader to face Sundstrom.

                                     AMBLER
                         We, the members of the Doctors 
                         Liberation Committee indict this 
                         hospital for the criminal neglect of 
                         the community in which it is situated! 
                         We demand an immediate dissolution 
                         of the governing and executive boards.

                                     SHOUT
                         What are you going to do about those 
                         fourteen ghetto people?

               As the shouts continue, Sundstrom raises a hand to quiet the 
               crowd.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         I am not going to do anything... 
                         about anything.

                                     SHOUT
                         Yes, you are!

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         By God, if you want to take over 
                         this hospital, you take it over!

                                     SHOUTS
                         We will! Right on!

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         You run it! I am finished! I quit! 
                         You run it! You pay the bills! You 
                         fight the city!

                                     MILITANT
                         We will!

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         You fight the state! You fight the 
                         unions. You fight the community! 
                         You... you think you can do a better 
                         job, you do it! Now I am finished! I 
                         quit! It's all yours!

               Eyes filled with tears of rage, Sundstrom lowers his head 
               and moves into the mass of militants, which parts for him to 
               leave.

                                     CROWD
                         Quit! Quit!

               The mass engulfs Sundstrom, moving back out into the lobby 
               with him, pushing him, shoving him, humiliating him.

               REACTION SHOT of Bock watching it all from the far end of 
               the corridor. He closes his eyes and the pain of watching 
               all this shows on his face. He opens his eyes. The corridor 
               is now silent and empty. He hurries to...

               HOLLY PAVILION, THE LOBBY

               Bock rushes in, as the milling throng dissolves into the 
               bystanders, security police and city cops. Common sense has 
               settled in and the general tenor is to avoid any further 
               trouble. We can hear the rhythmic patter of cops.

                                     SHOUTS OF COPS
                         All right, come on... come on -- 
                         Let's clear the area. -- Come on, 
                         let's clear this place... Keep cool. 
                         Everybody keep cool.

               Bock elbows his way through the throng as it drifts toward 
               the doors to...

               THE HOSPITAL, ENTRANCE PLAZA. DAY

               ...and goes through the gathering police. A mobile TV camera 
               crew and a few reporters are hurrying up through the gates 
               from First Avenue.

               FIRST AVENUE. DAY

               The Reverend Drummond stands, a solitary human island, among 
               the shrill ROAR of the city. The protesters protest endlessly, 
               CHANTING, SHOUTING. Absolutely no one pays any attention to 
               the gaunt, doctor-clad sixty-year-old man standing on an 
               island.

               Except, of course, for Bock, who must pause to wait for a 
               red light. Bock hustles through the traffic to where Drummond 
               stands.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Let those who are in Judea flee to 
                         the mountains, for the age is closed, 
                         the season of the seventh seal is at 
                         hand! The age is closed! The season 
                         of the seventh se...

                                     BOCK
                         Dr. Welbeck is dead. They thought he 
                         was you.

                                     DRUMMOND
                         Yes, I know. We must arrange to have 
                         his body shipped to my Apache village 
                         where we will bury him with full 
                         tribal rites. In a day or two, 
                         somebody'll ask, "Whatever happened 
                         to Dr. Welbeck?" And it will be 
                         assumed he absconded to Brazil to 
                         join his partner, the eminent 
                         orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Noel Hogan. 
                         Welbeck, too, was mislaid, overlooked, 
                         forgotten to death, you see.

               The ambulance pulls up and Barbara gets out of it.

                                     BARBARA
                              (taking her father 
                              around to the back)
                         We have to hurry, Dad.

               The light turns green. The traffic starts flowing around 
               them, disjoined by the ambulance blocking one lane on each 
               side of the dividing island. An ambulance attendant has opened 
               the back doors to get Drummond in. Barbara hurries toward 
               the front, climbs in, holds the door open for Bock. He stands 
               a few paces back.

                                     BOCK
                         I'm not going.
                              (he moves to the 
                              ambulance, closes 
                              the door)
                         The hospital's coming apart. I can't 
                         walk out on it when it's coming apart. 
                         Somebody has to be responsible, 
                         Barbara. Everybody's hitting the 
                         road, running to the hills, running 
                         away. Somebody's got to be 
                         responsible.
                              (across Barbara to 
                              the driver)
                         Kennedy Airport. You've got a two-
                         thirty flight to make.

               He turns, and the ambulance pulls away. Bock goes back to 
               the sidewalk where he meets Sundstrom, now wearing his coat.

                                     BOCK
                         You going back in?

                                     SUNDSTROM
                         Yeah.

               They make their way back toward...

               THE HOSPITAL, ENTRANCE PLAZA

               The two physicians trudge across the U-drive.

                                     SUNDSTROM
                              (matter-of-factly)
                         It's like pissing in the wind, right, 
                         Herb?

                                     BOCK
                         Right.

                                                                  FADE OUT.

          CAMERA PANS DOWN to reveal A HOT TUB FULL OF HOT CHICKS IN
          BIKINIS. They splash about playfully. Then--

          A FUCKING LION JUMPS IN THE HOT TUB!
          As the girls SCREAM and scramble for safety, the BEAST ROARS
          and it becomes the:

          ADAM COLEMAN (late 30s, good-looking, sweet-natured face) is
          in a great mood as he packs a SUITCASE.

          LILY (O.S.)
          Ready for the wildest bachelor
          party of all time?
          LILY (early 30s, shirt and jeans, hot in a smart and classy
          sense) walks in the room, smiling.

                         ADAM
          You know it. I'm gonna bang all
          sorts of chicks this weekend!

                         LILY
          That's not the answer I was looking
          for.

                         ADAM
          Sorry, honey.
          Adam gives his beautiful fiancee a playful kiss.
          She shows him some PHOTOS.

                         LILY
          Look what I found...

          A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS and 20-SOMETHINGS PARTY IN A LARGE HOT
          TUB at a SKI RESORT. It looks like the most fun ever.

                         ADAM
          Check out that young stud. Can you
          believe he's about to get married?
          Lily and Adam look through more PHOTOS of a YOUNG ADAM (17)
          partying at a SKI RESORT with his FRIENDS:
          -- In full 80s SKI GEAR on a mountain...
          -- Eating PIZZA at "Papa Enzo's," stuffing their faces...
          -- Drinking BEERS at the "Brew Haus," an awesome pub...
          -- In the HOT TUB with SIX GIRLS...
          Adam snatches the last photo from her.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Ignore that one. Nothing happened.

                         (BEAT)
          I love you.
          Lily laughs.

                         LILY
          Adam, you didn't know me yet.
          As Adam goes back to packing, Lily leafs through some more of
          the photos. She stops at one and her EXPRESSION CHANGES.

                         LILY (CONT'D)
          Who's this?
          Lily shows Adam a PHOTO:
          -- A SMOKING HOT SKI BUNNY (23, blonde, svelte, leg warmers).

                         ADAM
          I'm not sure.

                         LILY
          Really?
          Lily shows Adam another PHOTO:
          -- YOUNG ADAM with his arm around the SKI BUNNY, who looks
          like she was ambushed for the photo.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          3.

                         ADAM
          Oh! Jennie.

                         LILY
          Who's Jennie?

                         ADAM
          She's nobody. Ski instructor.
          (off her look)
          You didn't know me yet.
          Lily still looks at him a little hard.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Lily, I was 17. She had boobs and
          a face. Of course I'm gonna take
          her picture.
          Lily still looks a little bothered.

                         LILY
          Do you still think of her?

                         ADAM
          Of course not! I think of you.
          As Adam goes to EMBRACE her:

                         LILY
          Hold on...
          Lily goes into the CLOSET.

                         ADAM
          Sweetie?
          She comes out a moment later with a CARDBOARD BOX, which she
          empties onto the BED. About FIFTY PORNO MAGAZINES spill out,
          ranging from TITS MONTHLY to BLACK ASS.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          How did you know where I hid my...
          treasure?
          Lily carefully picks up a BROCHURE from the pile, holding it
          by the corner, not wanting to touch it.

                         LILY
          Explain this.
          From ADAM'S POV, we see the brochure:
          -- A ski brochure featuring Jennie on the cover.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          4.

                         ADAM
          OK! You caught me! I
          occasionally... reminisce... about
          Jennie O'Keefe!

                         LILY
          That's gross.

                         (THEN)
          What's "occasionally?"

                         ADAM
          (without missing a beat)
          About two hours ago when you were
          on the phone with your mother.

                         LILY
          Jesus. Tell me how I'm supposed to
          let you go to your bachelor party
          and not be a basket case?

                         ADAM
          What are you so worried about?

                         LILY
          I'm worried that you're still
          thinking about this girl.

                         ADAM
          Baby, the girl in that picture was
          nothing more than a crush. I could
          never get her and there's no
          possibility I'll ever be with her.
          She was a total stranger.
          Lily gets a CURIOUS LOOK on her face.

                         LILY
          So... you're into strangers?

                         ADAM
          Well not the creepy "your mom was
          in an accident, now come with me"
          kind. But yeah, the hot lady in
          the supermarket kind of stranger.
          You have to admit - it's kinda hot.

                         LILY
          So you're saying if you and I
          didn't know each other, it would be
          pretty hot if we fooled around?

                         ADAM
          You kidding me? It would be
          fucking incredible.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          5.
          Lily smiles seductively, as Adam starts to get it.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Wait a minute. Are you
          suggesting... yes. YES!
          Adam excitedly heads for the door.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          OK, I'll go down the hall. You get
          into character.
          (points at her)
          This fucking rules.
          Adam leaves the room and Lily REMOVES HER SHIRT, talking sexy
          and slowly building the fantasy...

                         LILY
          Oh I'm all alone in this big house.
          Cheerleading camp just ended and I
          need to get out of these sweaty
          clothes...

          ADAM (O.S.)
          Love where you're going with this,
          baby! Keep it up!
          She unbuttons her pants and SLIDES DOWN HER JEANS.

                         LILY
          Mmmm. My panties are so tight
          against my firm naked body...

          ADAM (O.S.)
          You should probably take them off!

                         LILY
          Are you gonna let me do this?

          ADAM (O.S.)
          Sorry! Continue! You were just
          about to take off your panties!
          She slowly slides out of her panties, kicking them away. Now
          she's TOTALLY NAKED. She continues to role play.

                         LILY
          It feels so good to be so naked. I
          hope no one can see me...
          Just then a BLACK MAN (late 30s, handsome, J Crew) saunters
          through the bedroom door, holding a coffee and all riled up.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          6.

                         BLACK MAN
          OK, so this asshole in front of me
          at the donut place is -- WHOA!
          Lily covers up and SCREAMS.

                         LILY
          Get out of here!!
          He SPILLS the coffee on his hands and their rug as he turns.

                         BLACK MAN
          Fuck! Ow! I'm sorry. I'll clean
          it up. That's gonna stain, though.

                         LILY
          Just leave!
          He heads for the door, just as:
          Adam comes in, wearing a MAILMAN hat and NOTHING ELSE.

                         ADAM
          Special delivery for -- Jesus
          Christ!
          The black man doesn't know which way to look. He covers his
          eyes and drips coffee, as he blindly steps toward the door.

                         BLACK MAN

                         (NOT LOOKING)
          Just tell me when I'm in the clear.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. ADAM'S HOUSE - DAY

          Adam wheels his suitcase down the front path of this modest,
          well-kept suburban home, as a recovered, dressed, embarrassed
          and somewhat shell-shocked Lily follows with a small bag.
          They both stop 10 yards short of a RANGE ROVER, where the
          black man, NICK, waits in the car, waving.

                         LILY
          I can't wait for you to come back
          and marry me. Wow, that's crazy.
          Adam looks almost like it just hit him.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          7.

                         ADAM
          Yeah.

                         (REALIZATION)
          Wow.

                         LILY
          Tell me again I have nothing to
          worry about.

                         ADAM
          Babe, look at Nick...
          In the car, Nick air drums to whatever's on the radio.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          You think with him in charge, we're
          gonna get into any kind of trouble?
          We'll probably eat too much pizza
          and I'll twist my ankle getting off
          the ski lift.

                         LILY
          OK. Have an awesome bachelor
          party. Not too awesome.
          (hands him bag)
          I got you something.
          Adam looks in the bag.

                         ADAM
          Sandwich. Thanks.
          He puts it in his BACKPACK. She looks like she was expecting
          a different reaction, but she lets it go. He kisses her.

                         LILY
          Let me see your phone.
          He takes it out.

                         ADAM
          I told you, I'll call you when--
          She snatches it out of his hands. Adam looks confused, as
          she pockets the phone.

                         LILY
          Despite my anxiety, I'm not gonna
          be one of those women who wants an
          update every ten minutes. Even
          though I do want an update every
          ten minutes.
          Adam smiles. Lily looks a bit trepidatious.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          8.

                         LILY (CONT'D)
          Just make sure whatever happens,
          you're back for the rehearsal
          dinner.

                         (SHOWING CONCERN)
          I totally trust you.

                         ADAM
          You should. I'm a lame-o.

                         LILY
          Well at least you're a cute lame-o.
          Lily leans in and they NUZZLE their noses together in a
          disgusting display of affection. A FLASH goes off.
          From the car, Nick holds up his iPhone.

                         NICK
          I'm more than willing to forget
          about earlier, but this shit's
          going on Facebook.

          INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

          Nick drives through SUBURBIA, while Adam rides shotgun.

                         NICK
          I have no idea what Facebook is.
          My phone has a button that says
          Send To Facebook. I've been
          sending shit there for months.
          Adam looks out the window, smiling.

                         ADAM
          I'm so psyched about this weekend!

                         NICK
          Ditto, buddy. I'm gonna help you
          make up for all the good times you
          missed when you were being a
          responsible member of society.

                         ADAM
          You're a good friend. I'm sorry
          for putting my career and self
          sufficiency above bowling night.

                         NICK
          This trip represents everything
          awesome about being a dude.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          9.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          We're gonna drink too much, eat
          whatever we want...

                         (FANTASIZING)
          I might not even change my socks.

                         ADAM
          Live the dream.

                         NICK
          Best of all, we don't have to
          answer to anyone.
          Nick's PHONE rings and he answers it with his built-in
          BLUETOOTH. His phone voice is a little more "sensitive."

          NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Hi honey.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          Three goddamn bags of pretzels?

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          (trying to save face)
          I'm with Adam, honey.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          Hi Adam.
          (a little calmer)
          Nick, what have I told you about
          buying snacks that aren't on sale?

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          You said not to do it.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          And what did you do?

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          I bought three bags of pretzels.
          But I'm gonna eat them...

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          That's not the point.

                         (ADMONISHING)
          Don't do it again.
          Nick and Adam exchange an embarrassing glance.

          NICK (ON PHONE)

          OK.

          COURTNEY (V.0.)
          Call me from the road. Adam, say
          hi to Lily.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          10.

          ADAM (ON PHONE)
          OK, I sure wi--
          CLICK. For a moment, there is an uncomfortable silence.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Don't her parents own the
          supermarket?

                         NICK
          The whole damn chain.

                         (THEN)
          Just be thankful Lily doesn't have
          any family money. Nothing makes
          your dick softer.

          EXT. MOTEL -- DAY

          Nick's car pulls into the lot of a rundown motel.

          INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY

          Adam looks confused and slightly nervous.

                         ADAM
          This looks like a place where
          people die. Mostly from murder.
          A BALD, miserable-looking GUY in his late 30s (LOU) exits a
          room, carrying TWO SHOPPING BAGS. He gets in the back seat.
          Adam looks happy to see him.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Lou!

                         LOU
          Yes, I'm living in a transient
          motel. Let's get that purple
          elephant out of the room.

                         ADAM
          Dude, it looks nice.

                         LOU
          Thank you. I hate your guts.

                         ADAM
          (re: the bags)
          What'd you bring?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          11.

                         LOU
          All my belongings.

                         NICK
          So you're sorta like a bum now,
          huh?

                         LOU
          In a sense.

          INT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

          Lou sits in the backseat, voraciously eating a bowl of
          cereal, as the other guys are up front.

                         LOU
          Our system is fucked, gentlemen.
          You tell me how a whore wife can
          fuck some black dude - no offense -
          and still take her cuckold of a
          husband for all he's got.

                         NICK
          Why would I take offense to that?

                         LOU
          It's offensive.

                         NICK
          Because he's black?

                         LOU
          And because he's fucking my wife.
          And because you're black. And
          because of all the oversensitive
          horrible garbage... you know what?
          Forget no offense. Just offense.
          Are you offended?

                         NICK
          Not really.

                         LOU
          Then shut the fuck up.

                         ADAM
          She's got a hell of an attorney.

                         LOU
          Yes and thank you so very much for
          giving her the referral.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          12.

                         ADAM
          She told me it was for a friend.

                         NICK
          So... what? Your wife likes black
          dick now?

                         LOU
          I'm gonna slaughter you in your
          sleep tonight.

                         ADAM
          (turns to Lou, genuine)
          Thanks for coming, man.

          EXT. UPSCALE APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

          Nick's car pulls up across from a nice apartment building, as
          a well-dressed, well-groomed, overly polished-looking YOUNG
          GUY in his 20s (JACOB) comes out, carrying a MESSENGER BAG.

          INT. NICK'S CAR -- SAME TIME

          The guys watch Jacob carefully cross the street.

                         LOU
          Oh, Adam's stupid brother's coming?
          Boo! Drive away before he gets in
          the car!

                         ADAM
          Be nice. I know Jacob's kind of a
          douche, but I'm trying to be closer
          to him since Mom died.
          Jacob gets in the back next to Lou.

                         LOU

                         (VERY INSINCERE)
          Hey buddy! How's it going? Good
          to see you!

                         JACOB
          You look dirty and you smell bad.

                         LOU
          You look gay and you smell like a
          basket of fancy soaps. Advantage
          me.

                         JACOB
          How is that to your advantage?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          13.

                         ADAM
          He's not gay. He's just... what
          are you again?

                         JACOB
          Metrosexual.

                         LOU
          You have sex with trains?

                         JACOB
          For your information, I fuck
          chicks. Hot ones.

                         LOU
          For your information, you fuck
          dudes. Gay ones.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, well at least I'm young and
          my life's full of potential. I
          hear you're homeless now?

                         LOU
          (to Nick and Adam)
          You told him?!

                         (GRIMACES)
          I hate all you people.

                         ADAM
          Will you two please shake hands and
          make up? We're gonna be spending a
          lot of time together.
          Jacob distractedly TEXTS on his phone.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, about that. Why aren't we
          going to Aspen? Vermont's lame.

                         ADAM
          It's gonna be fun.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, whatever.
          And with that, the guys travel in silence for a few moments,
          the lifeblood drained from the car. Finally...

                         LOU
          I've gotta take a shit.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          14.

          INT. BURGER KING REST STOP - DAY

          Lou walks from the bathroom back to the TABLE where Adam,
          Nick, and Jacob sit and eat.

                         LOU
          That was an ugly experience.

                         NICK
          I don't wanna hear about it.

                         LOU
          In a few years, when I'm dying of
          an exotic disease that causes my
          penis to bleed until it falls off,
          someone remember to tell the
          hospital to check out the filthy
          crapper at the Albany Rest Stop.
          It's the AIDS monkey of toilets.
          The guys put down their sandwiches.

                         ADAM
          Thank you.

                         LOU
          I don't know how you're doing it,
          man. I mean, Laurie's hot, don't
          get me wrong.

                         ADAM

                         (CORRECTING)
          Lily.

                         LOU
          Right. Lily. But one vagina?
          Forever?

                         ADAM
          That's the sacrifice.
          Jacob nods, agreeing with Lou's concern.

                         JACOB
          And you're OK with that? I don't
          know your sexual history, but you
          sure you got it out of your system?

                         ADAM
          I did OK for myself.

                         LOU
          He didn't do that well for himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          15.

                         NICK
          Yeah, isn't Lily your fourth?

                         ADAM
          Fifth. Thank you.

                         JACOB
          So you're averaging like one girl
          every eight years.

                         ADAM
          Assuming I got laid when I was
          zero.

                         LOU
          That would be awesome.
          Adam gives Lou a distasteful look.

                         ADAM
          I'm fine. Maybe some cold feet,
          but that's normal. Thank you
          everyone for your concern.

                         JACOB
          Just looking out for you. That's
          what brothers do, right? They look
          out for each other?

                         ADAM
          (takes a moment)
          Is this about something else?

                         JACOB
          Forget it.

                         ADAM
          No, let's do this. I'm sorry I
          wasn't around when you were growing
          up, OK? I was in college. And
          then I was working. Dad left.
          Someone had to take responsibility.

                         LOU
          Boooooring!

                         ADAM

                         (TO LOU)
          Shut up.

                         JACOB
          I said forget it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          16.

                         NICK
          Guys, come on. Let's move past it.
          This is gonna be a fun weekend.

                         JACOB
          I still say Vermont sucks.

                         LOU
          You're confusing Vermont with
          yourself. This weekend is going to
          be incredible and you will not ruin
          it for me.

                         ADAM
          (softens, to Jacob)
          You might like it. Havenhurst is
          pretty awesome.
          Jacob shrugs, but Lou gets excited.

                         LOU
          Fuck yeah it is! We're gonna ski
          the trail and bone some tail!

                         ADAM

                         (LAUGHS)
          You'll have to bone some of that
          tail for me, man.

                         LOU
          Fuck that. You'll bone your own.

                         ADAM
          No I won't.

                         LOU
          Adam, trust me. Biggest mistake of
          my life - not fucking a whore at my
          bachelor party.

                         NICK
          That's the biggest mistake of your
          life?

                         LOU
          Fuck yeah. And he's not making
          that same mistake.

                         ADAM
          Uh... I'm not having sex with
          anyone this weekend.
          Lou looks at Adam, trying to figure things out.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          17.

                         LOU
          Ohhhh. I gotcha.

                         (WINKING)
          You're not having sex this weekend.

                         ADAM
          I'm not having sex this weekend.
          Without the winking.

                         LOU

                         (WINKING)
          Right. No winking.

                         (WINKS AGAIN)
          I understand.

                         ADAM
          I'm pretty sure you don't.

          INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - DAY - DRIVING

          Nick's car transitions from the HIGHWAY to the MOUNTAINS to
          the WOODS, as we track the drive.
          Finally, the car passes a "Welcome to Havenhurst" sign.

                         NICK
          Gentlemen... welcome to Havenhurst.

                         ADAM
          Yes!

          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - AFTERNOON

          The car winds through the main thoroughfare. Rather than a
          quaint ski town, this place resembles a suburban nightmare,
          with STRIP MALLS and CHAIN RESTAURANTS. It's the exact
          opposite of the fun town we saw in Adam's photos.

          INT./EXT. NICK'S CAR - AFTERNOON - DRIVING

          The guys look out the windows, wearing bummed expressions.

                         JACOB
          so this is the coolest town ever?

                         ADAM
          Oh man. The Brew Haus is a PF
          Chang's.
          Lou notices a TGI Friday's, with a sign advertising a "Hannah
          Montana 3-D Experience!" He looks utterly disgusted.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          18.

                         LOU
          I don't even have the heart to tell
          you what I just fucking saw. But
          say goodbye to Papa Enzo's. This
          town sucks.

                         NICK
          What the fuck is going on?
          The car climbs a twisty part of the road.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Please god let it still be there...

                         JACOB
          What?

                         ADAM
          Pink Paradise. Best strip club
          ever.
          The car rounds the corner and a SIGN comes into view. The
          beginning reads "Pink."

                         NICK
          Yes! It lives!
          The car continues to climb and the whole sign comes into
          view: "Pinkberry."

                         LOU
          I wanna die.

                         JACOB

                         (OBLIVIOUS)
          Sweet, there's a Pinkberry here.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN - AFTERNOON

          The car pulls into the parking lot of this RUNDOWN lodge.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - AFTERNOON

          The guys walk in and the first thing they notice is a bunch
          of CATS that wander anywhere they want.
          The large "living room" area off the lobby features a FIRE
          PLACE that has been BRICKED SHUT.
          TODDLERS and ELDERLY PEOPLE lounge and cry and nap.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          19.

                         LOU

                         (TO NICK)
          What have you done to us?

                         ADAM
          I'm not playing drinking games with
          my grandma.

                         NICK
          OK so the place skews a little
          older. Let's check in. We're not
          spending our time inside anyway.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

          The guys walk silently behind a MIDDLE-AGED BELLHOP (PHIL),
          who struggles to wrangle their bags on a shaky hand truck.
          His job is made more difficult because he only has ONE ARM.
          He grunts and curses his way down the hall on the slow and
          laborious journey. But when Adam tries to pick up a bag...

                         PHIL

                         (CURT)
          Hey buddy. I'm not gonna tell you
          again. I fuckin' got it.
          Adam backs off.

                         LOU
          This guy's a dick.

                         NICK

                         SHH--

                         LOU
          No, fuck that.

                         (LOUDER)
          He's a dick. Oooh tough guy. He's
          gotta be Mister America.

                         JACOB
          Captain America.

                         LOU
          Go fuck yourself.
          Phil finally drops their bags at their room and then:

                         PHIL
          I'm ready to be tipped.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          20.

                         LOU

                         (SELF UNAWARE)
          You, sir, have no tact.
          Nick gives Phil a bill and he walks off down the hall,
          leaving the guys outside their room.

                         NICK
          Gentlemen... in this room lies the
          beginning of our awesome weekend.

                         JACOB
          Or a continuation of everything
          that's sucked so far.

                         LOU
          Yeah, I bet it's gonna be lame as
          shit in there. The furniture
          probably smells like mold.

                         JACOB
          I say we go to Foxwoods.

                         LOU
          I actually kinda like that idea.

                         ADAM
          Guys!
          Everyone looks at Adam.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Let's give it a chance. We don't
          know for sure that the room sucks.
          Nick nods, appreciating the optimism. He opens the door:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

          The room SUCKS. The ancient furniture looks like it smells
          like mold and there is nothing redeemable about the place.

                         ADAM

                         (SHRUGS)
          OK, so now we know.
          The guys drag their bags in and depressingly take stock of
          the situation -- presently the dirty old room.

                         JACOB
          What the hell is with this place?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          21.

                         LOU
          It's like a Stephen King novel,
          except not as cool.

                         NICK
          We'll feel a lot better once we hit
          the slopes.

                         (SMILES)
          Plus, I know there's one thing to
          look forward to.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON

          On a patio outside their suite, our guys stare at a KICK-ASS
          TOP OF THE LINE HOT TUB. Spacious seating, plenty of jets,
          underwater lighting. It's amazing.
          Adam, Nick, and Lou look energized.

                         LOU
          Thank. God.

                         ADAM
          At least some things never change.

                         JACOB
          What's the big deal about a hot
          tub?

                         ADAM
          Shame on you.

                         NICK
          There's plenty of time for tubbin'.
          Let's ski.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - AFTERNOON

          At the top of the mountain, Adam, Nick, and Lou look
          ridiculous in TIGHT, RETRO-STYLE NEON SKI JUMPSUITS. Jacob,
          on a snowboard, is the only one dressed in current attire.

                         JACOB
          (re: their outfits)
          When's the last time you guys
          actually went skiing?

                         ADAM
          It's been a few years.

                         NICK
          I think we look good.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          22.

                         JACOB
          Then you're an idiot.

                         NICK
          All right, we race down the
          mountain. Loser buys first round.
          Premium shit only.

                         JACOB
          You gonna be all right?

                         NICK
          What does that mean?

                         JACOB
          I dunno - do black dudes ski?

                         NICK
          Of course black dudes ski. Aren't
          I wearing skis?

                         JACOB
          I'm just not sure you're
          representative.

                         NICK
          You're calling me an Uncle Tom?

                         JACOB
          I don't even know what that means.

                         NICK
          It means black dudes ski.
          (pulls down goggles)
          Catch ya at the bottom.
          Nick takes off and... gets about 15 FEET, before he hits a
          GRASSY PATCH and falls over.

                         LOU
          Black dudes don't ski.

                         ADAM

                         (MOCK YELLING)
          How's the bottom?

                         CUT TO:

          ADAM HITS A BAD PATCH AND FALLS DOWN.

                         CUT TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          23.

          JACOB AND LOU COLLIDE, BOTH TRYING TO AVOID A BARE PATCH.

                         CUT TO:

          NICK PICKS UP SPEED, BEFORE HITTING A BARE PATCH AND FALLING.

          A LITTLE OLD LADY SLOWLY SKIS PAST HIM, KICKING UP POWDER.

          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - NIGHT

          Nick wears his "going out clothes" and walks along the main
          drag talking into his PHONE. It is clear that he is being
          CONSTANTLY INTERRUPTED on the other end of the conversation.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          No, the black ones... without the
          pleats... Because the pleats make
          me look fat... No, I put it on the
          Amex... Because I'm the best man...
          I know, but I'm organizing... I'm
          gonna get cash fr-- I'm gonna get--
          I'm gonna collect cash from the
          guys... Yes... Yes... Yes.

                         (LONG PAUSE)
          I love you too.
          Nick hangs up and we see that Adam, Lou, and Jacob have been
          walking with him, listening to his end of the conversation.

                         ADAM

                         (SYMPATHETIC)
          Dude...

                         NICK

                         (CLAPS HANDS)
          OK, who's ready to sink their teeth
          into a delicious dinner?

          INT. P.F. CHANG'S - NIGHT

           Our four guys looks MISERABLE, as they sit around a table at
           this popular Chinese food chain restaurant. Their
          overzealous WAITER (AIDEN) makes a big production of MIXING
          SAUCES, like he's Emeril.

                         AIDEN
          You fellas look like you can handle
          some spice. I'm gonna knock it up
          a bit... throw some chili sauce in
          there... oh yeah, there it is.
          This is gonna knock your socks off.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          24.
          Nick's expression looks like he wants to kill the guy.

                         NICK
          Thank you.
          The waiter walks away and Nick RAISES HIS GLASS in a toast.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          I'd like to propose a toast. To my
          best friend, Adam. He may be
          throwing his life away, but at
          least he's throwing it away with a
          hot chick at his side.
          The guys LAUGH and clink glasses.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          And so what if you only have one
          vagina for the rest of your life.
          Speaking as someone who's seen your
          wife's vagina -- it's definitely
          one of the good ones.
          Lou and Jacob look confused, but clink glasses anyway, as
          Adam mouths "What the fuck" to Nick.
          Jacob raises his glass.

                         JACOB
          To my brother, I say thank you for
          including me. I promise to try to
          make the most of it.
          The guys look confused at the backhanded graciousness.

                         ADAM
          Thanks for coming, man. It means a
          lot to me.
          Jacob nods halfheartedly.

                         NICK
          To Adam!

                         GUYS
          To Adam!
          The guys hug and clink glasses and excitedly CHATTER. Just
          then, a MANAGER appears at the table and CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                         MANAGER
          Gentlemen. You're going to have to
          keep it down.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                         25

                         NICK
          Come on, man. It's our friend's
          bachelor party. We're just trying
          to roast him a little bit.

                         MANAGER
          Well if you like roasts, I suggest
          the roast peking duck. It's out of
          this world and as I'm sure Aiden
          has told you, he can make it quite
          spicy.
          The guys look bothered.

                         MANAGER (CONT'D)
          But as for the noisy kind of roast,
          that's going to have to stop. We
          have many other guests trying to
          enjoy the P.F. Chang's experience.
          The manager walks away. For a moment, the guys are quiet.
          Lou takes a bite of his food, chewing slowly.

                         LOU
          This kung pau chicken pairs very
          nicely with the 97 cab. Very
          impressive choice, Nick.

                         NICK
          Thank you.

                         LOU
          Also, this is the worst bachelor
          party I've ever been to.
          Everyone puts down their forks, cathartically fed up.

                         JACOB
          Totally agree.

                         ADAM
          Nick, look. You had great
          intentions. No one's blaming you.

                         LOU
          I'm blaming him.

                         JACOB
          I'm totally blaming him. I didn't
          even want to go skiing.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          26.

                         NICK
          OK I'll admit this trip is not off
          to the best start. But we're due
          for a victory!
          Nick thinks and actually gets an idea. He SNAPS his fingers.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Hot tub!
          A lightbulb goes off for Adam too.

                         ADAM
          Yes!
          Lou gets up and throws down his napkin.

                         LOU
          Why did we even bother with dinner?
          Adam and Nick get up too.

                         JACOB
          Guys, I'm still hungry.

                         LOU
          Quiet, men are talking.
          Aiden approaches.

                         AIDEN
          Get you guys some to-go boxes?

                         LOU
          I would like you to die. And then
          I would like you to leave.
          Aiden walks away, freaked out. Lou turns back to the guys.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          It's tub time.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - NIGHT

          Lou, Adam, and Nick all have HUGE SMILES, as they gaze at the
          tub. They each hold a TON OF BOOZE.
          Jacob looks indifferent and a little turned off by it all.
          Lou strips down to his underwear and CLIMBS IN.

                         LOU
          Oh my god. The water is perfect.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          27.
          He POURS A VODKA and SLAMS IT BACK.
          Adam climbs in with Lou, pouring his own drink.

                         JACOB
          I really don't see the appeal.
          It's like a glorified bath.

                         NICK
          Jacob. Son. The hot tub is the
          whole thing! You ski all day.
          Then you hit the town, get trashed,
          and lure some fine ladies back to
          the lodge for some good old
          fashioned tubbin'.
          Nick CRACKS A BEER and pats Jacob on the back.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          So the town's dead? Fine, we skip
          that part and go right to the tub.
          Trust me. If there's fun to be
          had, the tub is a good start.
          Nick gets in.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Yes! It's amazing.
          Now it's just Jacob outside the hot tub. The other three
          guys are already starting to look more energized and happy,
          splashing around. After another beat of consideration...

                         JACOB
          Fuck it.
          Jacob strips down and gets in. As he submerges, he actually
          starts to loosen up a bit and smiles.

                         LOU
          Well?

                         JACOB
          I'm not convinced this is anything
          more than a bath, but it's nice.

                         NICK
          Hit him with some bubbles.

                         ADAM
          Coming right up.
          Adam CRANKS A KNOB. As the BUBBLES comes to life, we begin a
          TUBBIN' MONTAGE over Reel 2 Real's "I Like to Move It."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          28.
          -- In the tub, the guys DRINK like fish, pouring various
          combinations of VODKA, RED BULL, MOUNTAIN DEW, BACARDI, and
          anything else they can get their hands on.
          -- Jacob's LAPTOP is propped on the edge of the tub, playing
          BETTER OFF DEAD. Every so often, one of our guys takes a
          drink, playing a game, the rules of which only they know.
          -- Adam takes a big bite of the SANDWICH Lily gave him.
          -- Nick uses his iPhone to take video and pictures.
          More drinking games. The guys wear funny HATS and roll
          dice on a PIECE OF WOOD. Adam has to drink some tub water.
          -- The guys keep reaching into ADAM'S BACKPACK for MIXERS.
          -- Nick, Adam, and Lou LAUGH. Then, Lou lifts up Jacob's
          head, which he has been FORCIBLY HOLDING UNDER WATER. Jacob
          coughs and spits out water and looks pissed. Then he smiles
          and helps submerge Nick's head in the same way.
          -- Slam! Another bottle of vodka killed. Crush! Another
          empty Red Bull his the patio.
          -- A BEAR eats some DORITOS that have been left on a PICNIC
          TABLE. Yards away in the tub, the guys laugh and taunt it.
          -- Lou BLEEDS from where the bear has obviously SCRATCHED HIM
          across the chest. Still, he dances in the tub.
          -- Just for an instant (did we see that?), the guys are 3
          BLACK GUYS and ONE WHITE GUY, before changing back.
          -- The guys wear their SNOWSUITS in the tub. Adam very
          dangerously jumps in, attached to a SNOWBOARD.
          -- The CUTS get QUICKER and QUICKER, as hands reach into the
          backpack. More vodka. More Dew. More Red Bull. More
          Bacardi... The cuts SPEED UP and INTENSIFY until finally in a
          BRILLIANT FLASH OF LIGHT, we

                         EXPLODE TO:

          THE SUN RISING JUST ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - DAWN

          As the light of a new day spills into Havenhurst, we find all
          four of our guys PASSED OUT in the hot tub, the water calm.
          A KITTEN licks Lou's face. It's adorable. Until...

                         

                         

                         

                         

          29.
          Lou JOLTS AWAKE and PUKES ON THE KITTEN, sending it FLYING!
          This wakes up everyone and they stir to life, inspecting the
          carnage, mostly hangover-related.

                         NICK
          Oh my god, I wanna die.

                         JACOB
          I need a vitamin water.
          Adam reaches in his backpack, taking out two choices.

                         ADAM
          Red Bull or Fresca?
          Jacob takes the Fresca, as Lou inspects the CLAW MARKS.

                         LOU
          That fucking bear got me good.

                         ADAM
          Yeah he did.

                         LOU
          But we showed him, didn't we?

                         ADAM
          If by showing him, you mean we
          laughed and he got bored and
          wandered off into the woods with
          your sneakers, then yeah, we got
          him good.

                         LOU
          Fuck yeah.
          Lou picks up Adam's half-eaten sandwich and takes a BITE.

                         ADAM
          You just puked.

                         LOU
          That's why I'm eating your
          sandwich. I'm fucking starving.

                         NICK
          Guys, look...
          Their gaze turns to the MOUNTAIN PEAK, on which is a fresh
          LAYER OF POWDER. It looks like perfect skiing conditions.

                         ADAM
          Let's do it!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          30.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

          As the guys walk across the front of the lodge, they pass
          some well preserved CARS all parked together: a 1985 Pontiac
          Fiero, a 1986 VW Golf, and a 1987 Ford Mustang coupe.

                         JACOB
          What is this, a shitty car club?
          The guys COMPLETELY MISS the BILLBOARDS ACROSS THE STREET:
          -- "Coming soon: the most spaced-out Mel Brooks film yet!

          SPACEBALLS!"
          -- A surfing MAX HEADROOM with a CAN OF COKE and the tag:
          "Catch the Wave!"
          -- A bull terrier named SPUDS MCKENZIE parking with some HOT
          BABES and a shitload of BUD LIGHT.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

          In QUICK CUTS, the guys hit the slopes:
          -- In his ridiculous snowsuit, Nick skis down the mountain.
          With the new snowfall, he expertly glides along.
          -- Jacob applies some LIP BALM and flies down the mountain on
          a SNOWBOARD. People glare at him with confused expressions.
          -- Adam uses the snowplow method to slowly descend. He's a
          beginner skier. He takes the time to look at the
          surroundings and notices a YOUNGER, HOTTER CROWD skiing
          today. Lots of BLONDE SKI BUNNIES wearing PASTEL colors.

                         ADAM
          Well this place has improved.
          -- In the lift line, Lou passes a GUY wearing a BIG HEADBAND.

                         LOU
          Really, asshole?

          INT. GONDOLA - DAY

          Adam shares a gondola with Nick, as they make their way up
          the mountain. A DUDE IN SUNGLASSES sits across, napping.
          Adam takes a FLASK out of his backpack. He and Nick look
          over their shoulders like scheming kids as they take a nip.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          31.

                         ADAM
          I'm really glad we stayed. It's
          gonna be good to get away for a
          couple of days.

                         (QUALIFYING BEAT)
          I mean not like I want to be away
          from Lily. You know.

                         NICK
          Believe me I know.

                         ADAM
          I love her. But you guys are
          right. I'm gonna be with her for
          the rest of my life.

                         NICK

                         (NODS)
          For the rest of your goddamn life.

                         ADAM
          It gets easier, right? No offense,
          but watching you talk with Courtney-

                         NICK
          You're gonna be fine. You'll
          settle in, get the premium cable
          package - the usual deal.
          Adam nods.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          You'll wake up every morning,
          comforted by the fact that your
          wife doesn't wield her family's
          wealth over your head like a
          hangman's noose.
          Adam looks concerned, as Nick wistfully goes on...

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          You'll breathe the air of life,
          making the occasional decision -
          maybe get some lawn furniture. How
          about steak for dinner? Yes, let's
          get that juice machine I saw on TV.
          Let's fucking go for it.
          Nick stares off into the distance.

                         ADAM
          Nick?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          32.

                         NICK
          Sorry, I lost myself there.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES (O.S.)
          Coke?
          Adam and Nick look at the guy across from them, who presently
          offers his SKI GOGGLES, on which is a mountain of COCAINE.

                         NICK
          That is a lot of cocaine.

                         ADAM
          I feel like we're in Scarface.
          Only with skiing.

                         (THINKS)
          Skiface.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

                         (SNIFFS)
          Take it. It's good shit.

                         NICK
          I'm gonna pass.

                         ADAM

                         (DECLINES)
          Yeah, I'm good.
          The dude removes his sunglasses. He has a dead look in his
          eyes, studying Nick and Adam.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES
          You guys a couple of spazzes?

                         ADAM
          Spazzes?

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES

                         (VERY ANGRY)
          Yeah, dipstick. You narcs? You
          Miami Vice? Which one's Crockett?
          Which one's CROCKETT?!

                         ADAM
          I'm Crockett, obviously!

                         (TO NICK)
          That's the Don Johnson one, right?
          The dude flips out a SWITCHBLADE.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES
          You show me you're not spazzes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          33.

                         NICK
          We're not spazzes.
          The dude extends the coke once more.

          DUDE IN SUNGLASSES
          Show me.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - MOMENTS LATER

          At the top of the mountain, Nick looks WIDE AWAKE. Adam, on
          the other hand, looks COKED OUT OF HIS SKULL. He sniffs,
          fidgets, clenches his jaw, and looks generally "up."

                         NICK
          Adam, you gotta chill. You just
          did one line.

                         ADAM
          I've never ridden the horse before.

                         NICK
          You're not riding the horse. The
          horse is heroin.
          Adam can't stop moving and fidgeting.

                         ADAM
          I don't know what kind of animal
          I'm riding, but it's the best
          animal of all time. I feel great!
          Adam uses his SKI POLES to push off the top of the mountain
          and he goes FLYING DOWN THE SLOPE.

                         NICK
          Adam! Jesus.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / SKI TRAIL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

          Adam TUCKS down, still CLENCHING HIS TEETH. He PICKS UP
          SPEED as he flies down the mountain like a racer.

          FURTHER UP THE MOUNTAIN
          Nick has to pull up and slow down in the name of safety.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          34.

                         ON ADAM
          He zips along, never changing course or slowing. He BARELY
          MISSES a few TREES. But he can't stop himself before --

          HE BARRELS INTO A SMOKING HOT CHICK!
          The collision knocks Adam and the girl to the ground and
          finally stops Adam's hyper-speed descent.
          Adam gets up and shakes the cobwebs.

                         ADAM
          What a rush!
          He notices the girl on the ground and goes to help her up.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Oh wow, are you OK?

          SMOKING HOT CHICK
          No thanks to you, asshole!

          IN SLOW MOTION --
          The girl stands up in a very hot and awesome manner, SHAKING
          THE SNOW from her luxurious blonde hair. It twinkles in the
          sunlight. As she turns to face Adam,
          NORMAL SPEED RESUMES. And he sees who it is:

                         ADAM

                         (MIND BLOWN)
          Jennie O'Keefe!
          Jennie squints at Adam, trying to place him.

                         JENNIE
          Do I know you?
          He stares at her, not believing what he's seeing. He still
          looks loopy from the coke.
          Just then, a a too-blond, mirror-sunglass-wearing, feathered
          hair, striped-jumpsuited guy (BLAINE) SKIS UP and GRABS ADAM.

                         BLAINE
          I'm gonna serve you a knuckle
          sandwich, airhead.

                         (TO JENNIE)
          You all right, babe?

                         JENNIE
          I think so.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          35.
          Blaine's TOADIES (TAD and CHAZ) ski up behind him, as Blaine
          ANGRILY RIPS Adam's lift ticket from his jacket.

                         BLAINE
          Your lift ticket's been revoked.
          Blaine throws it on the ground and laughs to his friends.

                         ADAM
          (a la Lethal Weapon 2)
          Diplomatic immunity.
          Blaine looks confused, as Adam RIPS Blaine's lift ticket, but
          he ends up RIPPING BLAINE'S JACKET too.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Sorry, I was trying to... you can
          probably patch that up.
          Blaine PULLS Adam close by the collar and clenches his fist.

                         BLAINE
          You're dead meat, scumbag.
          Just then, SNOW POWDER flies in Blaine's face. Blaine lets
          go of Adam, as Jacob snowboards up and stops short, coming to
          his brother's side.

                         JACOB
          There you are! My brother's had a
          few too many triple Venti nonfat
          lattes if you know what I mean.
          (genuine, to Adam)
          Are you OK?
          Adam nods. Blaine looks confused. CHAZ and TAD look
          enamored with Jacob.

                         CHAZ
          Dude, they let you bring a
          skateboard on the mountain?

                         JACOB
          It's a snowboard. You know - no
          wheels.

                         TAD
          Genius! Man, not to get all fag on
          you, but I'm digging your fresh
          threads, bro.
          Adam and Blaine look equally confused with what's going on.
          Jacob takes the compliment well, like he deserves it.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          36.

                         JACOB
          Thank you. It's mostly North Face.
          A little EMS.

                         CHAZ
          Whatever it is, it works.

                         TAD
          Totally. What are you doing with
          this boner? You should be skiing
          with us. Like permanently.
          Blaine looks really annoyed with his friends.

                         BLAINE
          Guys!

                         TAD
          I mean, that's if Blaine thinks
          it's cool and everything.
          Blaine takes a deep breath, annoyed.

                         BLAINE

                         (TO JACOB)
          Get your spaz brother out of here.
          And for his sake, I don't wanna see
          him back on my mountain.

                         CHAZ

                         (EAGER)
          You're welcome any time though!
          Adam picks up his BACKPACK, which fell off during the
          collision. He stares at Jennie again and smiles.

                         ADAM
          You look JUST like this girl. I
          had the biggest crush on her--
          Blaine grabs the bag out of Adam's hand and SHOVES ADAM away.

                         BLAINE
          This is mine now.
          Adam looks at Blaine angrily, but Jacob holds him back.

                         JACOB
          Come on. Let's just go.
          Jacob ushers Adam off the slope, as Blaine shoulders the bag.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          37.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - DAY

          Adam and Jacob walk in the front door. Gone are the children
          and old people. The living room off the lobby presently
          hosts what appears to be an amazing 80s RETRO PARTY. A radio
          plays Miami Sound Machine's "Conga."
          Girls and guys wear printed sweaters, feathered dos, and neon
          leggings. It's something out of a mid-80s Aspen photo shoot.
          Nick walks in behind them, looking as confused as them. He
          turns up his palms and shakes his head, at a loss for words.

                         ADAM
          What is going on?
          Lou strolls up to the guys, with his arms around TWO HOT
          CHICKS. He looks elated.

                         LOU
          Guys! I'm so glad you're here. I
          want to introduce you to Michelle
          and Sandy. These lovely ladies are
          having a roller skating party next
          weekend and no offense, but fuck
          your wedding -- I'm totally coming
          back. By the way...
          Lou rolls out a ZIPLOCK BAG full of cocaine.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          There's coke everywhere around
          here. This place rules!
          Lou dips into the coke and rubs it on his gums and we:

                         CUT TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

          The suite looks a little "fresher." The furniture is the
          same, but everything's in better shape. It looks almost new.
          Adam, Jacob, and Lou sit in the main room with the TV on, as
          Nick emerges from a bedroom.

                         JACOB
          Has anyone else noticed that things
          around here are weird as shit?
          Adam and Nick nod. Lou shakes his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          38.

                         LOU
          Don't you ruin this. If you wake
          me from this dream, I'll kill you.

                         ADAM

                         (IGNORING LOU)
          What do you think happened?

                         JACOB
          I have no idea, but look...
          Jacob turns up the VOLUME on the TV. The NEWS airs.

          NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
          The Dow Jones Industrial Average
          closed just above 2,000 today...

                         NICK
          I'm ruined!

          NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
          In other news, the Tower Commission
          has rebuked President Reagan for
          not controlling his national
          security staff in an arms-for-
          hostages deal with Iran...
          For a moment, the guys sit there in stunned silence. Then...

                         LOU
          (with genuine emotion)
          We're in 1971.

                         ADAM

                         (CORRECTING HIM)
          We're in 1987.
          Everyone looks stunned and dazed.

                         JACOB
          What are we gonna do? I have plans
          next weekend.

                         ADAM
          We all have plans. It's my fucking
          wedding!

                         NICK
          Now hold on, we don't know for sure
          that we're in 1987.
          The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64
          computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with
          the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you..."

                         

                         

                         

                         

          39.
          When it's over...

                          NICK (CONT'D)
          OK, we're in 1987.
          Adam stands up, completely losing it.

                         ADAM
          What the FUCK is going on?!
          Nick stands up and calmly takes charge.

                         NICK
          Everyone relax. I think I know
          what's happened. And when we're
          done discussing it, we're all gonna
          feel a lot better.
          Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          Two words: black hole.
          He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly
          going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused.

                         NICK (CONT'D)
          I saw a special on the Science
          Channel. And guess what?
          Sometimes this happens.

                         ADAM
          This happens?

                         NICK
          Yes. And the best thing for us to
          do is to stay put. The universe
          will eventually reverse itself and
          work out this little glitch.
          Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness.

                         ADAM
          This is a big glitch.

                         JACOB
          Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes
          are in space. Not at a ski resort.

                         LOU

                         (HOPEFUL)
          So does this mean we get to go to
          girls' locker rooms and see them
          naked and they can't see us?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          40.

                         JACOB
          No, we traveled through time.
          We're not invisible.
          Lou looks upset.

                         LOU
          (under his breath)
          I'm still gonna do it.

                         ADAM
          Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness
          of how we got here for a moment--

                         NICK
          Black hole.

                         ADAM
          How are we supposed to get back?
          For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then:

                         LOU
          We find a scientist.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. IBM / RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON

          Our guys WAIT NERVOUSLY near a RECEPTION DESK, above which is
          the "IBM" logo. Lou reads a MAGAZINE.

                         LOU
          This Dukakis guy seems like he
          might be the real deal.
          An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches.

          MAN IN SUIT
          Gentlemen, how may I help you?

                         NICK
          We're waiting for a scientist.

          MAN IN SUIT
          I am a scientist.

                         LOU
          Where's your white coat?

                         SCIENTIST
          I'm not that kind of scientist.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          41.
          Lou stands up and throws down his magazine.

                         LOU
          This is bullshit! I told you--

                         ADAM
          Wait a minute. Just tell him.

                         NICK
          OK. You tell him, Adam.

                         ADAM
          Sir, we...

                         (EMBARRASSED)
          This is ridiculous.

                         SCIENTIST
          Nothing's too ridiculous in the
          name of science.

                         JACOB
          We're from the future.

                         SCIENTIST
          Get the fuck out of here.

          EXT. IBM OFFICE PARK - LATE AFTERNOON

          A SECURITY GUARD escorts our guys out of the building.

                         ADAM
          That went well.
          Lou starts walking off by himself.

                         NICK

                         (TO LOU)
          Where are you going?
          Lou points to his watch.

                         LOU
          Five o'clock. Happy hour.
          The guys look at him, confused.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          If it's '87, the PF Chang's will be
          gone, which means the Brew Haus
          still stands.

                         (THEN)
          It's Saturday. They have wet T-
          shirt contests on Saturdays.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          42.
          The guys' eyebrows raise. After a moment:

                         ADAM
          Well, maybe one drink. Just to
          confirm.

          INT. BREW HAUS - HAPPY HOUR

          SPLASH! A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST is underway on a STAGE.
          Whitesnake on the juke, PAC MAN on the tables, and cheap
          beers in the mugs - this is an amazing brew pub.
          Our guys sit in the back, wearing PINE VALLEY LODGE shirts.
          There are MANY EMPTIES on the table and they look VERY DRUNK.
          In a roped-off area in the corner, a cocky YOUNGER PHIL (the
          one-armed bellhop) wields a CHAINSAW that he uses to carve an
          ICE SCULPTURE, impressing the bar crowd. He has BOTH ARMS.

                         NICK
          Holy shit. It's that bellhop.

                         JACOB
          Should we warn him?

                         ADAM

                         (COVERS EYES)
          I don't want to see this go down.
          Phil TOSSES THE CHAINSAW IN THE AIR and...
          He expertly CATCHES IT, seamlessly continuing to carve. A
          GIRL leans in and gives him a kiss.

                         LOU
          Fuck that guy.
          ON THE STAGE, TWO GIRLS compete for wettest t-shirt. They
          both decide that NO T-SHIRT is the wettest option.

                         NICK
          God bless our country.

                         ADAM
          (in a daze)
          We're in 1987.

                         JACOB
          You can stop saying that. I don't
          think it's making a difference.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          43.

                         ADAM
          Seriously, we have to get back.
          (kinda losing it)
          We seriously have to get back!
          The guys subdue Adam, as a BIG-HAIRED WAITRESS brings drinks.

                         WAITRESS
          Here ya go, guys. Three Buds, one
          Bartles and James.
          The guys all stare at her like she's a museum artifact.

                         WAITRESS (CONT'D)
          What? I have lipstick on my teeth?
          Nick sips his WINE COOLER, feeling the eyes of the others on
          him.

                         NICK
          Hey, if it's available, I'm
          ordering it. I always wanted one
          of these when I was little.
          The waitress puts down the CHECK. Jacob picks it up,
          realizing something.

                         JACOB
          (to the waitress)
          Can you give us a second?
          She walks away, as Jacob turns to the guys.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          This is gonna be a problem.
          He takes out his wallet, showing his CREDIT CARDS and CASH.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          Guys, we're in trouble. Our cards
          aren't gonna work and our new money
          looks fake.
          The guys look concerned, but then Nick notices something:

          A TABLE FULL OF JAPANESE BUSINESSMEN.

                         NICK
          I've got an idea.
          As Nick gets up and approaches the businessmen, Adam looks
          around the room and by the bar, he spots --

                         

                         

                         

                         

          44.
          Jennie.
          He stares at her from across the room. Lou and Jacob notice.

                         ADAM
          I still can't believe it's really
          her!

                         LOU
          She's aged remarkably well.

                         (REMEMBERS)
          Oh, right. Why don't you just go
          talk to her?

                         ADAM
          I should go talk to her. To
          apologize, of course. You know,
          nothing inappropriate.

                         LOU
          Sure...
          Adam GETS UP. He slowly makes his way over across the room.
          Jennie is talking to TWO OTHER GIRLS as Adam approaches. He
          lurks near them like a creep. Jennie eventually notices him,
          as he keeps stealing glances. She doesn't look happy.

                         JENNIE

                         (TO ADAM)
          Listen putz, if you're gonna try to
          attack me again, my boyfriend will
          be here soon. He'll kick your ass.
          Adam tries to be casual.

                         ADAM
          No, no. No ass kicking. I just
          wanted to say I'm sorry about
          earlier. I lost control of the old
          skis there.

                         (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
          Looks like I shoulda taken another
          one of your classes!

                         JENNIE
          When did you take my class?

                         ADAM
          Certainly not when I was a kid! I
          mean, that would make no sense!
          Adam tries to recover.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          45.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I was here for a convention. Power
          tools. And regular tools. All
          sorts of tools. I'm big into
          tools. It was a couple years ago.
          Jennie looks very suspect of Adam.

                         JENNIE
          Yeah, OK. Have a good night.
          Jennie starts to walk away with her friends.

                         ADAM

                         (TOO FRIENDLY)
          Hey, where ya going?
          She ignores him, but one of her friends quietly lags behind.

                         JENNIE'S FRIEND
          (quietly, to Adam)
          Are you with that guy over there?
          She discretely points out Jacob.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, he's my brother.
          She takes Adam's PALM and writes something on it.

                         JENNIE'S FRIEND
          There's a party later tonight at
          this address. Make sure he comes
          with you. He's way boss!
          Adam walks back to his friends.

                         JACOB
          How'd it go?
          He shows them his palm.

                         ADAM
          We got invited to a party later.

                         LOU
          sweet! What are we gonna do until
          then?

                         ADAM
          How about figure out how the hell
          to get back to the present day?
          Nick walks back to the table and SLAMS down a pile of CASH.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          46.

                         NICK
          Bam!

                         LOU
          We're millionaires!

                         NICK
          Close. It's a thousand bucks.

                         ADAM
          Where did you get that money?
          Nick points out the Japanese Businessmen.

                         NICK

                         (PROUDLY)
          Sold them my iPod.
          Jacob looks incredulous.

                         JACOB
          That was NOT a good idea!

                         LOU
          I agree. You left so much money on
          the table. It's a fucking iPod!
          You could've gotten a LOT more!

                         JACOB
          That's not what I--

                         ADAM
          (looking at watch)
          Fellas, we are not making progress
          and we're losing time.

                         NICK
          Adam, don't worry. Time's not
          moving forward in the future.

                         JACOB
          Uh, yeah it is. Lest we forget the
          lessons learned from Bill and Ted.

                         NICK
          Well then I give you Back to the
          Future.

                         JACOB
          That's not fair. You can't go
          right to Back to the Future.

                         NICK
          Why not?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          47.

                         JACOB
          Back to the Future had a time
          machine.

                         NICK
          Well so did Bill and Ted.

                         ADAM

                         (REALIZES)
          Wait, that's it! I can't believe
          I'm about to say this, but I think
          we have a time machine.

                         NICK
          Adam, all we did is get drunk in
          the hot tub.
          Everyone's EYES GO WIDE.

                         LOU
          (puts it together)
          A hot tub time machine.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - EARLY EVENING

          All four guys soak in the tub. They TOAST with drinks.

                         ADAM
          Here goes nothing!
          They simultaneously DOWN their drinks. Nothing happens.
          Like the chimps in 2001, each of them begins FIDDLING WITH
          KNOBS and PUSHING ON LIGHTS, trying to find the magic button.
          After a few moments:

                         NICK
          Well, it was worth a shot.
          ANGLE WIDENS to reveal other PEOPLE in the tub. A GUY AND
          GIRL make out, two STONERS pass a joint, and one TOPLESS
          CHICK just chills out.

                         LOU
          (stares at girl)
          I love this place.
          As Lou pours himself another, Adam starts to lose it again.

                         ADAM
          Guys, we're running out of ideas
          here!

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          48.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I mean we tried the scientist, the
          tub -- what the fuck do we do next?
          Lou DOWNS ANOTHER SHOT and gets a crazy look in his eye.

                         LOU
          I know what we do next.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

          A DELOREAN is parked in the empty lot. Adam, Nick, and Jacob
          look at it, drunkenly and bleary-eyed. Adam and Nick trade
          swigs from a BOTTLE OF WHISKEY.
          The gull wing door opens and Lou steps out, in a foul mood.

                         LOU
          Rental car agency fucked us!
          There's no flux capacitor.
          Lou pulls Jacob over and straps him in the driver's seat,
          before walking around to the passenger side.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          (to Adam and Nick)
          We'll travel to 2010. Then one of
          us will come back and get one of
          you. And so on and so forth.

          INT. DELOREAN - EARLY EVENING

          Lou sits in the passenger seat next to Jacob.

                         LOU
          Go light on the clutch. I don't
          wanna lose our deposit.
          Jacob starts the car.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME TIME

          Adam and Nick watch the car pull out of the parking lot.

                         ADAM

                         (SOBERING SLIGHTLY)
          This will not end well.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          49.

          INT./EXT. DELOREAN - SAME TIME

          Jacob and Lou hit the road, picking up speed. They pass a
          COP, who pulls out, turning on his LIGHTS AND SIREN.

                         LOU
          Oh shit, they found me! I don't
          know how but they found me!

                         (LAUGHS)
          I always wanted to say that. Punch
          it!
          Jacob HITS THE GAS.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Let's see the look on this pig's
          face when we hit 88 and disappear
          into thin air! Yeah!
          The SPEEDOMETER hits 75, 80, 85, and then 90. And then 95.
          The car SHAKES VIOLENTLY.

                         LOU (CONT'D)

                         (SURPRISED)
          This thing's a piece of shit.
          Up ahead, the ROAD CURVES DRASTICALLY.

                         JACOB
          Hey Lou?

                         LOU
          Yeah?

                         JACOB

                         (VERY CALM)
          We're doing a hundred. I can't
          control this car.

                         LOU

                         (NODS)
          I hear ya.

          EXT. ROAD - EARLY EVENING

          The Delorean BRAKES, but doesn't make the turn. It FLIPS
          OVER in a fantastic disaster and comes to a stop in a DITCH.
          The COP pulls over, gets out of his car, and DRAWS HIS GUN.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          50.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - EARLY EVENING

          Adam and Nick watch the accident from a distance.

                         ADAM
          So do you think we should run away?

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATER THAT NIGHT

          Looking ragged as hell, the four guys walk into the room and
          silently collapse on various BEDS and COUCHES.

                         LOU
          I wonder if we'll still be here for
          our court appearance.

                         ADAM
          If we're still here in four months,
          I will happily go to jail, because
          I'll be fucked anyway.
          A GUY walks out of the bathroom, wearing only a TOWEL. He
          looks startled.

                         TOWEL GUY
          Who the hell are you dweebs?!
          Lou is up IN A FLASH. He IMMEDIATELY DECKS THE GUY OUT COLD
          and PUMMELS HIM on the floor! The others pull him off.

                         NICK
          Jesus Christ, what the hell, Lou?!

                         LOU
          I have no tolerance for intruders.

                         NICK
          This is probably his room! We're
          not registered here in 87.
          Lou thinks for a moment and looks a "little" sorry.

                         LOU
          I'm still pretty OK with it.

                         ADAM
          You have a problem.

                         LOU
          Just help me put him outside.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          51.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

          The guys open the door to the suite and find TWO DUDES
          walking by. Adam stops them.

                         ADAM

                         (AWKWARDLY)
          Hey. Dudes. Our friend's...
          hellaciously wasted. He partied
          pretty hearty... to the max. To
          the extreme max.

                         DUDE #1
          Bodacious.

                         ADAM
          So you guys wanna fuck with him or
          what?

                         DUDE #2
          Excellent.
          The dudes take custody of the passed out TOWEL GUY and
          continue on down the hall, as our guys go back inside.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - NIGHT

          The guys look physically exhausted.

                         NICK
          Let's just go to sleep. We'll
          figure everything out in the
          morning. It's pretty late.
          Jacob checks his watch, rolling his eyes.

                         JACOB
          It's 8:45.
          The other guys look at their watches, surprised.

                         NICK
          Why am I so wiped out?

                         JACOB
          Because you're old and lame?

                         LOU
          Yeah, fuck that, we're going to
          that party!

                         ADAM
          We are not going to the party.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          52.

                         LOU
          Hear me out.
          Lou paces around the room like Patton addressing the troops.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          We saw the scientist. He was
          worthless. We tried the tub. Dead
          end. I got us a fucking time
          machine. From Hertz. It might as
          well have been a Nissan.
          Adam shakes his head, as Lou continues.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Gentlemen, it's fucking 1987.
          Nixon's in the White House, gas is
          free, and we're about to put a man
          on the moon!

                         ADAM
          Did we go to the same school?
          Lou turns and addresses Adam directly.

                         LOU
          The point is you haven't even met
          your wife yet! She can't fault you
           for shit that went down 23 years
          ago! Even if 23 years ago somehow
          ends up being tonight!
          Adam starts listening a little more closely, as some of Lou's
          logic actually makes "some" sense.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          It's time to start facing the fact
          that we may not be going home. And
          if that's so, then we owe it to
          ourselves to make the best life we
          can for ourselves.
          The guys listen intently, as Lou's speech reaches a
          passionate climax.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Because I don't want to be that
          college freshman who spends the
          first semester hiding in his dorm
          room, only to realize that come
          spring, he has no friends.

                         (MORE PASSIONATE)
          No!

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          53.

          LOU (CONT' D )
          I want to be that college freshman
          who fucks chicks way out of his
          league before they have an
          opportunity to realize he's not as
          cool as he's pretending to be!
          Nick nods. Even Jacob smiles.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Are you with me?

                         ADAM

                         (CONFUSED)
          I don't know.

                         LOU
          Close enough. We'll talk some more
          at the party.

          INT. HOUSE PARTY - NIGHT

          It's like the 80s exploded. Music, clothes, hair, attitude --
          it's all on overdrive. In one section, PARTY-GOERS marvel at
          DUCK HUNT, while in another area, people make out and dance.
          Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk in the front door. They have
          updated their "looks" with 80s sweaters and other era-
          appropriate attire. They all look ridiculous, except for
          Jacob, whose youth lends him hipster appeal.

                         ADAM
          This sweater makes me look like a
          jerkof f .

                         LOU

                         (BREATHES DEEPLY)
          It's good to be home.
          In a corner, Phil puts his ARM in a SHARK TANK. Just as the
          shark goes to bite, he PULLS HIS ARM OUT, unscathed. A small
          crowd claps. Our guys are confused and upset.

                         NICK
          Was this like an 80s thing?

                         LOU
          If he doesn't lose that arm soon,
          I'm gonna take it from him myself.
          With that, Lou wanders off toward another room, leering at
          and groping girls as he goes.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          54.

                         ADAM

                         (RE: LOU)
          He's gonna be a problem.
          Tad and Chaz walk over, looking dapper and douchey. They are
          excited to see Jacob.

                         TAD
          Hey, glad you could make it!

                         ADAM

                         (ANNOYED)
          This is your party?

                         CHAZ
          Hey man, no hard feelings, all
          right? If your bro says you're
          cool, then we're cool.
          Tad puts his arm around Jacob and leads him into the party.

                         TAD
          There's some people I want you to
          meet. By the way, bodacious hair.
          Incredibly chic.

                         JACOB

                         (FLATTERED)
          Oh yeah? It doesn't really take
          that much product. It's all in the
          layering.

                         TAD
          Whoa. Product. You're blowing my
          mind right now. Did you spend time
          in Europe?

                         CHAZ
          Don't tell me. Prague. Do you
          want some coke?

                         JACOB
          Do you have Coke Zero?

                         TAD
          Ah, a conscientious objector. I
          like that. Gotta stay sharp.

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Nick mixes something in a large bowl, as plenty of EAGER
          PARTY-GOERS look on. He pours a red liquid into a tray of
          CUPS. An attractive PARTY CHICK follows his every move.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          55.

                         NICK
          These will be ready in 15 minutes.

                         PARTY CHICK
          (putting it together)
          So it's like jello. With vodka.

                         NICK
          Mmm hmm. You get drunk while you
          enjoy a delicious gelatin snack.

                         PARTY CHICK
          How come no one ever thought of
          this before?

                         NICK
          Don't know. I just invented it.
          Party chick looks into his eyes, dreamily.

                         PARTY CHICK
          I appreciate you.

                         NICK
          (way too heartfelt)
          I love you.

          IN THE LIVING ROOM
          Lou PLAYS AN ELECTRIC KEYBOARD for about 15-20 people. He's
          performing Ace of Base's "The Sign" and SINGING PASSIONATELY.
          Adam walks up to where Jacob aims a large VIDEO CAMERA.

                         JACOB
          He did a bunch of drugs and went on
          a rant about how much he resents
          Ace of Base.

                         ADAM
          That band's from the 90s.

                         JACOB
          I know. He made me borrow Tad's
          video camera. He wants to document
          the performance and sue the band
          for infringement when we get back.
          Adam sees Tad and Chaz behaving like cocks across the room,
          making hot girls drink too much.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          56.

                         ADAM
          (re: Tad and Chaz)
          So, you like these guys?

                         JACOB
          They're rich, popular, and they
          shower me with compliments.
          They're pretty much the best
          friends I've ever had.

          ON A BALCONY
          A CROWD gathers around Phil, who has removed the cover of a

          SPINNING INDUSTRIAL FAN.

                         CROWD
          Phil! Phil! Phil!
          Like a zen master, Phil reaches out and GRABS A FAN BLADE,
          stopping the fan WITHOUT INJURY. Everyone celebrates!

          IN THE KITCHEN
          Nick holds up a HOMEMADE BEER BONG, from which he drinks. He
          has his own CROWD rooting him on.

                         NICK'S CROWD
          Nick! Nick! Nick!
          He finishes the last of the beer, and the crowd celebrates.

                         PARTY GUY
          This guy should be in charge of
          everything!

                         NICK
          I should.

          IN THE LIVING ROOM
          Lou SITS ON A COUCH with Michelle, one of the girls we met
          earlier at the lodge. Her friend Sandy sits across from them
          next to Jacob, who looks uncomfortable.

                         SANDY
          Truth or dare?
          Lou confers with Michelle before answering.

                         LOU
          Dare.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          57.
          Sandy and Jacob confer, figuring out the dare. Lou meets
          Jacob's eyes -- he smiles, knowing Jacob has his back.

                         SANDY
          OK, we dare Lou to put a Twizzler
          up his ass.
          Lou stands up and angrily points at Jacob.

                         LOU
          You son of a bitch! Have you ever
          played this game before? It's
          supposed to be awesome!
          Lou nevertheless grabs a TWIZZLER from the snack bowl and
          shoves it down the back of his pants. His face contorts
          uncomfortably and he is almost on the verge of tears.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          This is a horrible thing you're
          doing and I hope you never have to
          experience what I am currently
          going through.
          Lou sits down and Michelle consoles him.

                         MICHELLE
          Your turn! Truth or dare?
          Before Sandy can even confer with Jacob:

                         JACOB

                         (SMILES)
          Truth.
          Lou throws up his hands in frustration. He looks miserable,
          as Michelle confers with him.

                         LOU
          (grumbling to Michelle)
          I don't care. Whatever. This is
          not the point of the game.

                         MICHELLE
          OK, each of you has to tell your
          darkest, most personal secret.
          Lou crosses his arms and shakes his head.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          58.

                         JACOB
          Oh wow, all right. Let me think.
          I've never told anyone this, but I
          was afraid of scary movies until I
          was 18. I even ran out of the
          theater a couple of times.

                         SANDY
          Oh you poor thing! Come here...
          She takes Jacob's head to her chest and strokes it gently.
          Lou makes a jerk-off gesture.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)

                         (SHY)
          I'm not sure I should tell mine.

                         MICHELLE
          Come on! You have to!

                         SANDY
          OK, but you can't laugh.

                         LOU

                         (WHO CARES)
          We promise. Let's hear it.

                         SANDY
          So this one time me and my friend
          Lori took a train to Baltimore. It
          was the summer and we wanted to
          party, but we had no money. So
          Lori found this businessman who was
          also looking for a good time and
          told him that we'd give him a half
          and half for seventy-five dollars.
          You know -- a suck and fuck.
          Lou and Jacob look shocked with the MATTER OF FACT
          storytelling. Michelle smiles. She's heard it before.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          Anyway, we get him up to his room
          and Lori starts going down on him,
          but I really wasn't into it. So I
          broke a piece of the bathroom
          mirror and used it to cut his
          artery on the-heck. Right here...
          She rubs Jacob's neck, pointing it out.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          He bled for about an hour before he
          died.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          59.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          Afterwards, we took his wallet to
          the bar and found out he only had
          forty-seven dollars.
          Michelle GIGGLES.

                         SANDY (CONT'D)
          Michelle! You said you wouldn't
          laugh!

                         MICHELLE

                         (GIGGLING)
          I'm sorry!
          Jacob and Lou look shell-shocked.

          IN ANOTHER ROOM
          Adam sits in a chair in the corner, secluded. To his LEFT --
          Nick's in the kitchen, catching POPCORN in his mouth and
          earning accolades from all his new fans.
          To Adam's RIGHT --
          The truth or dare game devolves, as Michelle PIERCES LOU'S
          EAR. He screams in pain, but at the end, he has a GOLD STUD
          in his RIGHT EAR. Lou points at Jacob.

                         LOU
          Fuck you, your turn.

                         JACOB
          That's the gay ear, you know.
          As Adam looks STRAIGHT AHEAD --
          He sees Jennie all by herself, browsing the hosts' CASSETTE
          TAPE COLLECTION. Adam takes a moment to check himself. Then
          he reaches for his DRINK and GULPS THE WHOLE THING, before
          getting up and WALKING OVER to her, catching her off guard.

                         ADAM
          So I lied to you earlier. I wasn't
          here for a power tool convention.
          Jennie instinctively looks around for her friends.

                         JENNIE
          I know. You don't look like you
          could handle power tools.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          60.

                         ADAM
          The truth is, Jennie, I've always
          liked you. But I've never really
          known you. I really wasn't
          supposed to meet you again.

                         JENNIE
          Who are you?!
          Adam shrugs, indicating he might as well tell her.

                         ADAM
          I came here from the future.
          She rolls her eyes - she's heard all the one-liners.

                         JENNIE
          Let me guess. You want to beam me
          up to your spaceship built for two?
          Or maybe you're wondering if these
          are astronaut pants?

                         ADAM
          Astronaut pants?

                         JENNIE
          Because my ass is out of this
          world? Give me a break, spaz.
          I've heard them all.
          She turns away. Adam goes after her.

                         ADAM
          No! No spaceship. No astronaut
          pants. Just regular time travel.
          With normal pants.

                         JENNIE
          OK, what's the punch line?
          An ARM comes from behind and CHOKES ADAM. It's Blaine.

                         BLAINE
          I thought I told you to stay off my
          mountain, partner!

                         JENNIE
          Blaine, stop!

                         BLAINE
          You talking to my girl? Huh? I
          can't hear you.
          Adam fights to breathe, as Blaine chokes him harder.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          61.

                         JENNIE
          Blaine, that's enough! Let him go!
          He can't breathe!
          Blaine doesn't stop. He smiles like an asshole.

                         BLAINE
          Can't breathe? Is that right? Can
          you breathe, partner? What's that?
          I can't hear you. Just tell me you
          can't breathe and I'll stop.
          Adam still struggles. Blaine just shrugs.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          He's not saying anything. I guess
          he can breathe.
          Jennie pulls on Blaine's arm, trying to free Adam.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          Babe, stop. Jennie, stop!
          Blaine turns and accidentally ELBOWS JENNIE in the face. She
          goes down. He releases Adam and turns to help her.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          Baby, I'm sorry.
          (turns to Adam)
          See what you made me do?!

                         JENNIE
          Screw you, Blaine!
          Jennie gets up. She grabs Adam's arm and YANKS HIM along
          with her, as she storms away.

                         JENNIE (CONT'D)

                         (TO ADAM)
          Come on, let's go!
          Blaine looks ON FIRE, as he watches Jennie leave with Adam.

          LOU (V.0.)
          Sandy, I don't know what you did
          with this wine, but it is
          delightful.

          INT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT

          Jacob and Lou sit with Michelle and Sandy back at the girls'
          apartment. The whole place looks like a Madonna concert.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          62.
          Jacob looks uncomfortable, but Lou pours on the polite charm.

                         SANDY
          It's from a box. There's lots!

                         LOU
          Mmm. Fantastic.

                         (QUICK TURN)
          Do you mind if I borrow my friend?
          We'll only be a moment.

                         CUT TO:

          INT. APARTMENT / BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

          Lou has Jacob PINNED AGAINST THE WALL with his arm. He
          speaks quietly, but with purpose.

                         LOU
          You're gonna fuck her!

                         JACOB
          I'm not gonna have sex with her.
          She killed a guy!

                         LOU
          That guy was undesirable. You
          heard her. It was about the money.

                         JACOB
          Great, so she's a prostitute. I'm
          not sleeping with a hooker either.

                         LOU
          She's not a hooker. She's a girl
          who did what she had to do to make
          a few bucks.
          (tries new tactic)
          Listen, she's probably awesome in
          bed.

                         JACOB
          She probably has a hairy vagina.

                         LOU
          Exactly!
          Jacob looks confused.

                         JACOB
          I'm not having this conversation.
          It's pointless. I don't have a
          condom.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          63.

                         LOU
          Perfect! Me neither! No one here
          uses condoms. It's like heaven.
          Only with a lot more coke.
          Lou takes his COKE out of his pocket and SNORTS a bunch.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          How do I look?

                         JACOB
          Like a fucking madman?
          He slaps Jacob's arms.

                         LOU
          Rock and roll.
          Lou exits the bathroom and calls out to the girls.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Who's ready to get laid by an
          awesome penis?!

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / LOBBY - LATE NIGHT

          Adam and Jennie are sitting on the floor by the fireplace,
          playing MONOPOLY.

                         ADAM
          Oooh, Atlantic Avenue. That's
          gonna cost you.

                         JENNIE
          How much?

                         ADAM
          I'll tell ya what...
          Adam moves her token up a few squares and makes a show of
          looking over his shoulder, as if someone might see.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm not supposed to do this. But
          I'm gonna upgrade you to Marvin
          Gardens. It's a suite. Plus,
          there's an excellent buffet and a
          view of the pool.
          Jennie laughs, despite herself. She looks around, as if
          someone might see her. Adam notices.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          64.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          No one's gonna see you hanging out
          with the creepy spaz. Don't worry.

                         JENNIE
          I'm sorry I called you those names.

                         ADAM
          Hey, it's cool. I was being creepy
          and spazzy.

                         JENNIE
          You're still not gonna tell me how
          you know me?

                         ADAM
          I'm from the future.

                         JENNIE
          Fine, let's just drop it. I'm glad
          you're feeling better. Blaine had
          no right to hit you.

                         (SMILES)
          I bet he's going out of his mind
          right now.

                         ADAM
          What are you doing with a douche
          like him anyway? You're so much
          better than that.

                         JENNIE
          Yeah, well guys like you come to
          visit. Guys like him live here.

                         ADAM
          So if I lived here, I'd have a
          shot?
          For a moment, Jennie is thrown off. She's about to say
          something, but checks herself. Instead she nervously stands.

                         JENNIE
          I'm gonna get going.
          Adam stands up with her.

                         JENNIE (CONT'D)
          Thanks for being a good guy. I
          don't remember the last time I had
          this much fun playing such a stupid
          game.
          She gives Adam a sweet KISS ON THE CHEEK.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          65.

                         JENNIE (CONT'D)
          If you run into Blaine, you can
          tell him I blew you. But that's
          all. We didn't do anything else.

                         ADAM

                         (SURPRISED)
          We didn't do anything!

                         JENNIE

                         (SMILES)
          Shh. It's our little secret.
          Jennie exits, leaving Adam confused.

          INT. APARTMENT / BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

          In the darkness, we hear SOUNDS OF SEX. Moans of pleasure,
          creaks of mattresses, multiple "yesses."
          On TWIN BEDS that are a little too close to each other, Lou
          and Jacob have sex with Michelle and Sandy. The girls and
          Lou are vocal. Jacob is silent.
          As Sandy rides him, Jacob notices some BROKEN GLASS on the
          bedside table. He can't take his eyes off it, as Sandy's
          hand keeps brushing up against the table.
          Lou, naked, DRINKS A CAN OF TAB while he delivers the goods
          to Michelle. He reaches over, mid-act, and hands the half-
          empty can to Jacob.

                         LOU
          Tab?

                         JACOB
          Stop talking to me!
          Despite the fact that this looks like very good sex -- it is
          very bad sex for Jacob.

                         FADE TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE NIGHT

          Adam is asleep in bed, as Jennie quietly enters the room. He
          wakes up to find her wearing SEXY LINGERIE, as she CLIMBS ON
          TOP of him.

                         ADAM
          Jennie!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          66.
          He looks over and sees Nick SNORING in the other bed.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERS)
          What are you doing here?!
          Jennie gives Adam a LONG WET KISS. He's freaked out.

                         JENNIE
          I thought about what you said and
          you're right. I should be with
          you.

                         ADAM
          I didn't necessarily say that.

                         JENNIE
          I want you, Adam!
          She RIPS OPEN her lingerie, revealing her AWESOME HEAVING

          NAKED BREASTS.

                         ADAM
          Oh my god!
          She kisses him again and they start to go at it. Just then --

          LILY (O.S.)
          What the hell is going on here?
          Adam pushes Jennie off him, as the LIGHTS GO ON in the room.
          Lily is standing in the doorway, looking sad and angry.

                         ADAM
          Lily?

                         LILY
          So you do like her better than me?

                         ADAM
          No, she just--
          Adam looks to where Jennie just was, but now the bed is
          covered with PHOTOS OF JENNIE. There's also a LARGE BOX OF
          TISSUES and some HAND LOTION.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          What's all this?

                         (LOOKS AROUND)
          Jennie?

                         LILY
          What's wrong with my vagina, Adam?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          67.

                         ADAM
          Nothing's wrong with it. It's
          beautiful.
          In the next bed, Nick rolls over and wakes up.

                         NICK
          It's a beautiful vagina. Among the
          prettiest I've ever seen.

                         ADAM
          Stay out of it, Nick!

                         LILY
          Would it be so bad to spend the
          rest of your life with my vagina?

                         ADAM
          No. It wouldn't at all.
          Lily turns and walks out the door.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Lily, it wouldn't! I love your
          vagina! I love your vaginaaaaaa!

           SMASH CUT TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - MORNING

          Adam abruptly WAKES UP.

                         ADAM

                         (GROGGY MUMBLING)
          Vagina... huh?
          He sees Nick sitting on a bed on the other side of the room.
          He's ON THE PHONE, talking quietly with someone.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          I just really need to get a few
          things off my chest. You're
          domineering and you think you have
          all the answers, but you don't.
          Not by a long shot.
          Nick is getting emotional.

          NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          You think you're better than me?
          Last night I made jello shots and
          everybody loved me.

                         (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          68.

          NICK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          They didn't care that I only
          brought home 60k last year. They
          loved me for me. They didn't go
          throwing their rich parents' weight
          around.
          (wipes away a tear)
          I don't know, Courtney.

                         INTERCUT:

          INT. CHILD'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

          A 6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (Nick's future wife) listens to this
          crying man on the other end of the phone.

          6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)
          It's OK.
          Nick CRIES a little bit harder.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          It's so good to hear your voice. I
          love you, princess. I really do.
          You just make it so hard on me
          sometimes.

          6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)
          It's OK.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          You're right. It's OK. I just
          want it to be OK.
          Adam starts registering some of this conversation.

                         ADAM
          Who are you talking to?
          Nick looks at Adam and covers the receiver.

                         NICK
          Courtney.

                         ADAM
          What do you mean "Courtney?"
          Adam picks up ANOTHER PHONE.

          ADAM (ON PHONE) (CONT'D)
          Hello?

          6-YEAR-OLD COURTNEY (ON PHONE)
          Hello!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          69.
          Adam, freaked out, HANGS UP his phone.

                         ADAM
          Get off the phone!!
          But Nick is down the rabbit hole.

          NICK (ON PHONE)
          Baby, I gotta go. Just think about
          what I said. We're so great
          together. It's like when we're
          having sex - the way our bodies
          become one, as we both embrace the
          passion of the moment--
          On the other end, COURTNEY'S DAD has picked up the phone.

          COURTNEY'S DAD (ON PHONE)

          WHO THE FUCK IS THIS?!
          Nick hangs up the phone and stares at it, freaked out. Adam
          just shakes his head.

                         NICK
          OK, so that may have been bad.

                         ADAM
          What were you thinking?
          The DOOR OPENS and Lou strolls in, looking quite fresh.

                         LOU
          Guess who re-popped his 80s cherry?
          This guy!
          He points at himself in a celebratory manner, as behind him --
          The Towel Guy whose room this is comes RUNNING UP.

                         TOWEL GUY
          Hey, get the hell out of my room!
          In one move, Lou catches him inside the room, closes the door
          with his foot, and puts the guy in a HEAD LOCK. He then
          converts it into a SLEEPER HOLD, putting the guy to sleep.

                         NICK
          Oh, we're going to jail.

                         LOU
          Help me put him in the closet.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          70.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

          The guys drop the sleeping Towel Guy in the closet.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER

          Adam, Nick, and Lou take a soak in the tub.

                         ADAM
          Has anyone seen Jacob?

                         LOU
          He's grabbing drinks with Tad and
          Chaz. Which is what we should do.
          We'll start at the Brew Haus and do
          a three drink crawl up the street--
          Adam gets more fed up than ever.

                         ADAM
          Guys! I refuse to accept that
          we're stuck in 1987! Maybe you're
          loving it, Lou. But you don't get
          it. Nick's insane, Jacob's become
          a bigger douche than before, and I
          need to get back for my goddamn
          rehearsal dinner? Which is
          tomorrow!

                         LOU

                         (CALMLY)
          Adam. I know I don't look like I
          understand, but I do. You have a
          beautiful fiancee who means more to
          you than anything in the world.
          And if you could, you'd literally
          travel across time for her.

                         ADAM
          Yes.

                         LOU
          I get it, man. Life is about these
          moments. Moments where a regular
          Joe becomes a hero. Moments where
          you dig deep and find the
          motivation... the courage... the
          guts to do what's right and what's
          necessary. It's moments like
          these...
          Lou suddenly notices some COCAINE on the edge of the tub.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          71.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Jesus, how come nobody told me
          there was coke out here?
          Lou SNORTS A BIG LINE.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          What was I saying?
          Adam and Nick get out and towel off. Lou follows.

                         ADAM
          Maybe we have to learn something?

                         NICK
          What do you mean?

                         ADAM
          You know, like Groundhog Day. We
          have to learn the meaning of life
          or some shit.
          Just then, a KITTEN licking a PUDDLE on the base of the tub
          JUMPS in the hot tub and VANISHES IN A BRIGHT LIGHT!
          For a moment, everyone is quiet.

                         LOU

                         (FREAKED OUT)
          I've gotta stop doing cocaine and I
          need to go to the hospital. I just
          saw a fucking kitten explode.

                         NICK
          I saw it too.
          The guys run over to the tub. The bubbles are on low, but
          there's NOTHING IN IT.

                         ADAM
          It didn't explode. It vanished.
          It went back... to the present.

                         LOU
          This is the present.

                         ADAM
          Our old present.

                         NICK
          So it is the tub!
          Lou POINTS at something.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          72.

                         LOU
          Um...
          The HOT TUB IS NOT PLUGGED IN, and yet it's clearly running.

                         ADAM
          OK. You guys know what to do.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MINUTES LATER

          The guys have a COUPLE BOXES OF KITTENS. One at a time, they
          get in the tub and take turns DIPPING THE KITTENS. When
          nothing happens, Lou DUMPS an entire box of kittens into the
          tub. The cats get ANGRY and CLAW AT HIS FACE and body.
          Eventually, the guys just shake their heads.

                         ADAM
          This isn't working.

                         LOU
          Maybe these aren't the right
          kittens?
          Adam points at him in a "now you're thinking" way.

                         ADAM
          We'll split up. Get as many
          different cats as you can. Let's
          all meet back here in an hour.

                         LOU
          You can count on me!

          INT. BREW HAUS - DAY

          Lou sits on a stool, munching on snacks. A TV shows the AFC
          conference championship game between the Denver Broncos and
          the Cleveland Browns. It's the 4th Quarter and the Browns
          score with 5:43 remaining on the clock to go up by 7.
          Two stools over, a SLICK-HAIRED ASSHOLE (RICK) sits with his
          bored-looking HIGH SOCIETY TROPHY WIFE (CANDACE).

                         RICK
          Yes!

                         LOU
          Hate to tell ya, pal. Browns are
          gonna lose by 3 in overtime.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          73.

                         RICK
          Eat shit and die, scumbag. I've
          got ten large on this game.

                         LOU
          Not only that, but I bet you
          Elway's gonna throw a touchdown
          with 37 seconds left.

                         RICK
          Fat chance, pal. Elway's done
          nothing all day.

                         LOU
          Care to make it interesting?

                         RICK
          Who the hell are you?
          Lou thinks about the question for a moment.

                         LOU
          Name's Musselman. Hank Musselman.
          I've got a cool name, huh?

                         RICK
          It's a good name. What did you
          have in mind, Musselman?

                         LOU
          I win -- your wife gives me a
          blowjob. A classy one.
          For the first time, Candace looks less than bored. She does a
          bad job of feigning disinterest.

                         RICK
          All right, buddy, fuck off.

                         LOU
          You win -- you can kill me. Any
          way you want. Knife, gun, torch,
          sword... I'll even make a video
          exonerating you.

                         RICK
          Yeah, right...

                         LOU
          I'm serious. You look like a man
          who has everything. Except the
          license to kill. Care to gamble?
          Rick looks at Lou long and hard. Lou doesn't flinch.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          74.

                         RICK
          37 seconds?

                         LOU
          Exactly.

                         RICK
          You have a deal.
          As Rick and Lou shake hands, Candace makes a show of looking
          offended.

                         RICK (CONT'D)

                         (TO CANDACE)
          Don't worry, babe. This yahoo's
          made a wager he can't possibly win.
          Lou picks up another HANDFUL of bar snacks. He puts them in
          his mouth and shows it to Rick.

                         LOU

                         (MOUTH FULL)
          Look. Who am I? I'm your wife.
          Nuts in my mouth. Get it?

                         (TO CANDACE)
          I like it slow and romantic.

          EXT. PET STORE - DAY

          Nick leaves a pet store, carrying a BOX OF KITTENS. On the
          street, he accidentally bumps into one of the Japanese
          businessmen from the night before. He has a THICK ACCENT,
          like Gedde Watanabe in "Gung Ho."

                         NICK
          Oh, sorry man.

                         (NOTICES HIM)
          Hey! How's that iPod working out
          for you?

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          Oh, it's a very nice toy.

                         NICK
          If you like that, I've got a phone
          back at the lodge that will knock
          your socks off.

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          I wish I could see it. But I am on
          my way to a very important business
          meeting.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          75.

                         NICK
          Oh yeah? More important than
          Bluetooth?

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          My associates and I are co-
          financing a... how do you say it...
          supermarket business.

                         NICK

                         (SUSPICIOUS)
          You're not going to Boston, by any
          chance?

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          Yes! Boston! We leave tonight.

                         NICK
          You're gonna franchise out the
          Gelman's Mom and Pop!

                         JAPANESE BUSINESSMAN
          Yes! How do you know this?
          Nick puts his arm around the guy and walks down the street.

                         NICK
          Walk with me a minute. Let me tell
          you about some companies you should
          really be looking into...

          INT. THE DECK - DAY

          Tad, Chaz, and Jacob enjoy drinks on a deck overlooking the
          mountain ski slopes.

                         CHAZ
          You really are a gas, Jacob. Tad
          and I think you're the cat's
          pajamas.

                         JACOB
          Thanks. I like you guys, too.
          A THIRD DOUCHEBAG arrives and gives a SECRET HANDSHAKE to Tad
          and Chaz. He drops off a PILL BOTTLE. This is GEOFFREY
          (pronounced JOFF-rey).

                         GEOFFREY
          Gentlemen.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          76.

                         TAD
          Geoffrey, please meet Jacob.
          Excuse his Jewish name. He really
          quite exceeds it.
          Jacob looks confused by that, as Geoffrey shakes his hand.

                         GEOFFREY
          Jacob, would you like some too?
          He offers a pill bottle.

                         JACOB
          What is it?

                         CHAZ
          Rohypnol. Geoffrey's father is a
          pharmacist, but we don't hold that
          against him.

                         JACOB
          Rohypnol?

                         TAD
          You slip it to a chick who won't go
          to third. Give it an hour and
          you'll be rounding home.

                         JACOB

                         (SURPRISED)
          This is a date rape drug.

                         GEOFFREY

                         (LAUGHS)
          What the fuck is date rape?

                         JACOB
          These are roofies!

                         CHAZ
          Roofies... I like that!

                         TAD
          Yeah, it takes the clinical name
          right out of it. It sounds so
          fresh, chicks might even take it
          voluntarily!

                         (TO JACOB)
          Hey, can we use that?
          Jacob looks beside himself.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          77.

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - AFTERNOON

          A GUY and a GIRL are using the hot tub, which is still hot
          and bubbly, despite the fact that it isn't plugged in.
          Nick and Lou sit at the table, as Adam approaches with CATS.

                         ADAM
          I got regular cats. I figured
          maybe the kitten was a fluke.
          Nick takes the box out of his hands and puts it down.

                         NICK
          Come here.
          He leads Adam near the tub, where Lou points at something.

                         LOU
          There!

                         ADAM
          What am I looking at? It's some
          kind of stain.

                         LOU
          Smell it.

                         ADAM
          I'm not smelling it.

                         LOU

                         (NODS ENCOURAGINGLY)
          Smell the stain.
          Adam puts his nose up against the stain and SNIFFS. He
          recognizes something, but can't put his finger on it.

                         ADAM
          What is that?

                         NICK
          Red Bull.

          GUY IN TUB
          Hey, you fellas mind? I'm trying
          to get a handjob here.

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - AFTERNOON

          Our guys sit and absorb the impact of what they've learned.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          78.

                         ADAM
          So you're telling me that Red Bull
          plus hot tub equals time travel?

                         LOU

                         (NODS PROUDLY)
          Mmm hmm. Hank Musselman's getting
          the Nobel Prize.

                         ADAM
          Who the fuck is Hank Musselman?

                         NICK
          There was just enough Red Bull for
          the kitten. Not nearly enough for
          a human. It's a weight
          distribution thing.

                         ADAM
          How did you even figure this out?

                         LOU
          Scientific method.

                         NICK
          He bet me 20 dollars I wouldn't
          lick the stain.

                         LOU
          I thought it was some guy's jizz.

                         ADAM
          What's wrong with you?

                         LOU
          It worked, didn't it?

                         NICK
          Yeah, except one little problem.
          There's no Red Bull in 1987.
          For a moment, they're all bummed again. Then Adam gets an
          encouraged look on his face.

                         ADAM
          Yes there is! Come on!
          Adam heads for the door, as Lou and Nick follow.

          EXT. BUNNY SLOPE - DAY

          Jennie instructs a group of TEENAGERS on the basics of
          skiing, as Adam approaches, with Nick and Lou in tow.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          79.

                         JENNIE

                         (CONCERNED)
          You can't be here. If Blaine sees
          you, he'll snap your neck. I told
          him I blew you and he's not happy.

                         ADAM
          Why would you do that?!
          Behind Adam, Nick looks at the group of TEENS and his eyes
          almost BUG OUT. He elbows Lou.

                         NICK
          (whispers, teeth clenched)
          Look.
          Lou looks to where Nick is looking:
          YOUNG ADAM, YOUNG NICK, and YOUNG LOU wait with other kids
          for Jennie to return to their lesson.

                         LOU
          Holy shit!
          Lou immediately approaches the kids, even as Nick tries to
          hold him back.

                         NICK

                         (TEETH CLENCHED)
          where the fuck are you going?!
          Lou walks right up to his YOUNGER SELF and looks himself
          square in the face.

                         YOUNG LOU
          What the hell do you want, old man?
          Lou PUNCHES his YOUNGER SELF in the face. Young Nick and
          Young Adam are freaked out, as is regular Nick. Adam doesn't
          notice, as he's arguing with Jennie.

          YOUNG LOU (CONT'D)
          What the fuck, dude?! I think you
          broke my nose! My parents are
          gonna sue the shit out of you!

                         LOU
          Herschel and Evelyn aren't gonna do
          a damn thing. They're losers.

                         YOUNG LOU
          How do you know my parents?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          80.

                         LOU
          Listen to me. Start putting
          minoxidil on your scalp. Tonight.
          Then, when Propecia comes on the
          market, start taking it. Every
          day. Hair is important.

                         YOUNG LOU
          I don't give a shit about hair.

                         LOU
          You will!
          (leans in, quietly)
          Or I'll tell everyone about how you
          jerked off to that issue of
          Playgirl.

                         YOUNG LOU

                         (QUIETLY)
          It was confusing! There were naked
          people and it had "girl" in the
          title!

                         LOU
          Hey, you don't have to justify to
          me, pal.

                         YOUNG LOU

                         (FREAKED OUT)
          Who are you?

                         LOU
          I'm God.

          ON ADAM AND JENNIE

                         JENNIE
          Fine. You wanna see Blaine? It's
          your funeral. He's in the
          warehouse at the end of Lawrence.
          Good luck.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY

          Adam walks off the mountain with Nick and Lou.

                         LOU
          Moment of truth.
          Lou takes off his hat and feels his scalp - no hair.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          81.

                         LOU (CONT'D)

                         (LOOKS BACK)
          That fucker!
          Just then, Lou's NOSE SLIGHTLY SHIFTS, the result of being
          broken and never fixed. It stays this wa for the rest of
          the movie.
          Lou touches his nose.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Oh, that's just great.
          Jacob runs up, in a friendlier disposition.

                         JACOB
          Hey guys!

                         ADAM
          I thought you were with douche
          patrol.

                         JACOB
          Yeah I was. But it turned out
          those guys are date rapists.

                         ADAM
          Ah.

                         NICK
          Adam, where are we going?
          Adam gets a look of determination again.

                         ADAM
          To get my bag. We get that, we
          have the Red Bull, and our ticket
          home.

                         LOU
          Yes! The race is on!

                         ADAM
          What race?

                         LOU
          Duh, it's 1987? We're at a ski
          resort?

                         (SHAKES HEAD)
          Disputes like these are settled
          with a downhill ski race. Usually
          at dawn. It's the law.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          82.

                         ADAM
          You're an idiot.

          INT. WAREHOUSE - AFTERNOON

          Adam and the guys step into a warehouse. WET FLOOR, CHAINS
          hanging from the ceiling for no reason, STEAM rising from
          grates. As they enter, Chaz pulls down a large GARAGE DOOR.
          Up ahead, Blaine sits on some CRATES with Tad.

                         BLAINE
          Welcome to my lair.

                         ADAM
          You live here?

                         NICK
          Yeah, this is kind of a shitty
          place to live.

                         BLAINE
          I don't live here.
          Adam approaches Blaine, trying to speak maturely.

                         ADAM
          Look. Blaine. I think we got off
          on the wrong foot. You have some
          issue with me.

                         BLAINE
          You get blown by my girl? I'll say
          that's one hell of an issue.

                         LOU
          Whoa! You got blown?!

                         ADAM
          She didn't blow me. She lied to
          you to make you jealous. I'm not
          trying to steal Jennie. I just
          wanna get my bag.

                         BLAINE
          Oh, your bag. I was wondering when
          you'd come around for that.
          Tad holds up the BACKPACK over by the crates.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, I'll just take it and get out
          of your way.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          83.

                         BLAINE
          You will?
          Adam EXTENDS HIS HAND.

                         ADAM
          Whattya say? Can we work this out
          like gentlemen?
          Blaine PULLS A KNIFE. Tad and Chaz also PULL KNIVES.

                         NICK
          What is this town's obsession with
          knives?

                         BLAINE

                         (MENACING)
          How about I work this out like... a
          butcher?
          Just then, LIGHT SPILLS INTO THE DARK WAREHOUSE. A GUY in a
          polo shirt stands in a dooorway.

          GUY IN POLO SHIRT
          Hey! Scumbuckets! Back to work!
          Like naughty children being caught red handed, Blaine and his
          goons lose the knives and hustle toward the open door.
          Blaine grabs the backpack from Tad.
          Adam and the guys follow through the door and into --

          INT. SUNGLASS HUT - DAY

          Adam, Nick, Lou, and Jacob are confused, as Blaine, Chaz, and
          Tad spring to action, helping CUSTOMERS choose sunglasses.
          Jacob approaches Tad and Chaz, who look embarrassed.

                         JACOB
          You guys are posers! You're not
          better than me!

                         TAD
          Jacob, I wish you hadn't seen us
          like this.
          Adam stands near Blaine, who helps a WOMAN.

                         BLAINE

                         (TO WOMAN)
          These would look so good with your
          light complexion.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          84.

                         ADAM
          Listen asshole! I want my bag!

                         BLAINE

                         (TO WOMAN)
          Will you excuse me for a moment?
          Blaine walks behind the COUNTER and SHOVES THE BAG in a SAFE.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          Safe's on a timer. It'll open
          tomorrow. We race at dawn. Winner
          gets the bag. Loser leaves town.
          Lou turns to Nick.

                         LOU
          See? I told you!

                         ADAM

                         (TO BLAINE)
          I don't wanna race you.

                         BLAINE
          Then I guess you don't want your
          bag.

                         (SMIRKS)
          See you at dawn.

                         ADAM
          Your girlfriend sucks one hell of a
          mean dick.
          Adam makes a SLURPING SOUND and Blaine fumes.

          EXT. HAVENHURST MAIN DRAG - LATE AFTERNOON

          Nick, Lou, and Jacob walk behind Adam, who looks pissed.

                         NICK
          What are we gonna do?

                         LOU
          That chick blew you?!

                         ADAM

                         (INTENSE)
          I've got a race to win.
          Europe's "The Final Countdown" begins playing over a MONTAGE:
          -- Skis are sharpened.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          85.
          -- Gear is polished.
          -- In the SUITE, Adam gets dressed in his GEAR.
          -- On a SMALL HILL, Jacob demonstrates some moves on skis.
          Adam doesn't get it. He's keeps falling.
          -- On the hill, Jacob teaches Adam how to SNOWBOARD. Adam is
          having an easier time standing up on the snowboard.
          -- The guys keep Adam awake and use a homemade SCALE MODEL of
          the mountain to formulate a plan, a la Iron Eagle.
          -- Back on the hill, Jacob and Adam snowboard next to each
          other. Adam makes it by a couple of obstacles. Jacob looks
          proud of him.
          -- The guys play an ATARI SKI GAME, trying out a strategy.
          Jacob uses a POINTER, looking disappointed.
          -- On the hill, Adam easily maneuvers by a few trees on the
          snowboard, kicking up snow and HIGH-FINING Jacob.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAWN

          SLO-MO HERO SHOT of our four guys, as they ascend the top of
          the mountain. If we didn't know any better, it would look
          like Tony Scott directed a ski movie.

          END MONTAGE.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY

          A few yards away from Nick and Lou, Adam sits on the ground,
          as Jacob helps him strap into the snowboard.

                         JACOB
          Just stick to the plan and you're
          gonna be fine.
          Adam looks at Jacob seriously for a moment.

                         ADAM
          Jacob, I'm sorry for not always
          being the big brother I should've
          been. I was away at college, Mom
          gave you my Sega - there were a
          whole host of issues.
          Jacob nods and speaks genuinely to Adam too.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          86.

                         JACOB
          I know. I'm sorry too. I put a
          few things before my family and
          took my guilt out on you.
          (puts it together)
          I guess it was an inevitable I'd
          end up part of a roofie ring.
          Adam smiles and extends his hand.

                         ADAM
          Friends?
          Jacob takes Adam's hand and helps him to his feet.

                         JACOB
          Brothers.
          They EMBRACE. Lou looks disgusted.

                         LOU
          Gay.
          Blaine and his goons approach from below. Adam puts on his
          game face.

                         ADAM
          I didn't think you guys would show.

                         BLAINE
          This was my idea.

                         ADAM
          It's gonna make my victory taste
          all the more sweeter. Like a Peach
          Snapple.

                         BLAINE
          A what?

                         ADAM
          You'll see.
          Blaine actually looks rattled, as the two men get lined up.
          Adam is on a SNOWBOARD.

                         BLAINE
          What's that?

                         ADAM
          You're not afraid of getting beat
          by a guy on a skateboard, are you?

                         

                         

                         

                         

          87.

                         BLAINE
          I've seen you in action. You're
          reckless and terrible.

                         ADAM
          Reckless and terrible's my middle
          name. Because I feel the need...
          (pulls on goggles)
          for speed!
          Chaz holds out his arm as a starting line.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          Catch ya at the bottom.

                         CHAZ

          3, 2, 1... GO!
          Blaine takes off down the mountain like a professional
          skiier, which he pretty much is. Adam looks toward Jacob,
          who demonstrates the proper CROUCH. Adam slowly picks up
          speed, starting at about one mile per hour.
          Blaine looks back and can't believe how easily he's gonna
          coast to victory.

                         ADAM
          Here goes nothing.
          Instead of weaving back and forth, Adam just stays in the
          crouch, PICKING UP SPEED. He recklessly PASSES BLAINE,
          despite the many TREES and OBSTACLES on the course.
          He BEARS DOWN AND TRAVELS LIKE A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!
          Blaine finds the guts to alter his STYLE, skiing more
          recklessly too. He begins catching up to Adam.
          Blaine skis up next to Adam - they're both going full force.

                         BLAINE
          You can't beat me! I was born on
          this mountain!

                         ADAM
          I was born in a hospital like a
          normal baby!
          Adam bends down and picks up even more speed, NARROWLY
          MISSING trees and rocks. Blaine tries to keep up.
          Adam has the finish line in his sights, when he rolls the
          dice once too often. His SNOWBOARD GETS SNAGGED on a rock
          and Adam TUMBLES TO THE GROUND.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          88.
          The SNOWBOARD FLIES OFF INTO THE AIR!

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / BASE - DAY

          Phil stands against a SHED, as a GUY THROWS A HATCHET at him,
          just narrowly missing his arm. Phil FLEXES HIS MUSCLES, as a

          HOT CHICK KISSES HIM.
          Then the SNOWBOARD FLIES INTO FRAME and SLICES OFF PHIL'S
          ARM, sending BLOOD SPLATTER EVERYWHERE!

                         PHIL
          Ahhhh! My arm!!!

          EXT. MOUNTAIN / TOP - DAY - SAME TIME

          Lou watches with BINOCULARS and PUMPS HIS FIST.

                         LOU
          Yes!

          EXT. MOUNTAIN - RACE - DAY

          As Adam tumbles on the ground, Blaine smiles, thinking he has
          the victory in the bag.
          But instead of stopping, Adam picks up speed, as he TUMBLES
          LIMB OVER LIMB, like a snowball going down the mountain.
          With 50 YARDS to go, Blaine bears down and tries to catch
          Adam. It's gonna be close.
          At the FINISH LINE, Adam's CRUMPLED BODY passes the line
          first. Blaine pulls up, pissed off to lose the race.
          Adam's momentum carries him forward another 50 yards, where
          he SMASHES INTO A DECK and finally comes to a stop.

                         CUT TO:

          A CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE POPS!

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - LATE AFTERNOON

          A large "BON VOYAGE" BANNER hangs in the room.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          89.
          An ALL-OUT PARTY is going on in the guys' suite. GUESTS
          party everywhere, helping the guys celebrate.
          Sandy and Michelle flirt with the two dudes who took brief
          possession of the Towel Guy yesterday.
          The Coke Guy from the gondola talks with the Brew Haus
          Waitress.
          Adam's leg is in a CAST, as he sits at a table with Jacob,
          Nick, and Lou. The OPEN BACKPACK is in front of them. They
          DRINK and TOAST.

                         NICK
          You did it, man.

                         ADAM
          Ah, it was nothing. I just fell
          down the mountain.

                         NICK
          It was a beautiful fall.
          Lou goes into Adam's backpack and pulls out the SANDWICH,
          which he begins unwrapping.

                         ADAM

                         (DISGUSTED)
          Tell me you are not going to keep
          eating that.
          Lou takes a bite and SHRUGS.

                         LOU
          Chicken parm. It's my favorite.

                         ADAM
          Chicken parm?
          Adam takes the sandwich from Lou. He looks at it closely.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         (LAUGHS)
          Chicken parm. On this roll.
          The guys look confused, as Adam stares at the sandwich.

                         JACOB
          Adam, what is it?

                         FLASHBACK TO:

                         

                         

                         

                         

          90.

          INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - NIGHT

          Adam and Lily nervously make eye contact at the front of the
          restaurant, as a SNOOTY HOST shakes his head.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          It was our first date. You know
          those nights that are just perfect?
          This wasn't one of those nights.

          INT. MOVIE THEATER - DARK

          Adam and Lily sit through "From Justin to Kelly," the
          American Idol movie. They don't enjoy themselves.

          EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

          Adam inspects a HUGE DENT in the side of his car. As he does
          so, a car drives by, SPLASHING A PUDDLE on Lily.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          If Lily knew where we were, I'm
          sure she would've walked home. And
          I wouldn't have blamed her.

          EXT. ITALIAN DELI - NIGHT

          In the RAIN, Adam and Lily run toward the entrance of a
          little deli. Inside the doorway, a LITTLE OLD WOMAN shakes
          her head no. Adam pleads with his eyes and she lets them in.

          INT. ITALIAN DELI - NIGHT

          Adam and Lily sit and talk animatedly at the counter in the
          small, empty deli, eating SANDWICHES.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          We were so hungry by the time we
          found that deli, we would've eaten
          anything. So what if it wasn't
          foie gras and pino noir. It was
          chicken parm and Italian soda. And
          it couldn't have been more perfect.

                         BACK TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY

          The guys enjoy listening to Adam's story.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          91.

                         NICK
          That sandwich was special, huh?

                         ADAM
          You could say that. You could also
          say it gave me horrible diarrhea.

                         FLASHBACK TO:

          INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT / BATHROOM - NIGHT

          Adam SHITS HIS BRAINS OUT. When it looks like. he might be
          done, he turns around and VOMITS into the toilet.

          INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Lily waits by the bathroom door with some PEPTO and a GLASS
          OF WATER. She looks very concerned.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          Lily had every opportunity to
          leave. She didn't know me at all
          and she certainly didn't owe me
          anything after the night I put her
          through. But she stayed.

          INT. ADAM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

          Adam lays on the couch, his head in Lily's lap. She feeds
          him a little GATORADE. He keeps it down... for a moment.
          Then he turns and VOMITS into a BUCKET on the floor.

          ADAM (V.0.)
          She saw me at my worst and she
          stayed.
          Lily holds the bucket, as Adam pukes into it.

                         BACK TO:

          INT. PINE VALLEY INN / SUITE - DAY

          Nick, Lou, and Jacob look sick.

                         ADAM
          Don't you see? This is more than a
          sandwich. It represents all that
          shit. All that puke.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          92.

                         LOU
          Keep the sandwich.

                         JACOB
          This is disgusting.

                         ADAM
          She gave me this as a reminder of
          her love.

                         (THINKS)
          Or to give me horrible diarrhea so
          I didn't leave the room during the
          bachelor party. But mostly as a
          reminder of her love.
          Adam holds up the sandwich.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          This is the reason I need to go
          home.
          Adam stands up and walks toward the door with the sandwich.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          I'm gonna go prep the tub.
          Lou holds up a BAG OF CHIPS.

                         LOU
          Do you have any stories about these
          chips or can I eat them?

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - CONTINUOUS

          Adam walks outside, taking a bite of the SANDWICH. He finds
          Jennie waiting in the TUB.

                         JENNIE
          There you are!

                         ADAM
          Jennie! What are you doing here?

                         JENNIE
          Making good on a rumor.
          Jennie STANDS UP in the tub and she's TOPLESS.
          Adam DROPS THE SANDWICH, shocked.

                         ADAM
          Whoa.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          93.
          Jennie continues talking, shamelessly exposing herself.

                         JENNIE
          When I saw you win that race
          against Blaine, everything changed
          for me. I realize now that I
          deserve more. I deserve a winner.

                         (SEDUCTIVE)
          Come and get your prize.
          Adam reaches next to the tub and hands her a ROBE.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, I... can't.
          She covers up, embarrassed.

                         JENNIE
          Oh my god. I missed my
          opportunity.

                         ADAM
          No, I'm not sure there ever was an
          opportunity. Jennie, you're
          terrific. You've brought me so
          many moments of joy, you'll never
          know. But I shouldn't have given
          you the wrong idea.
          Jennie looks sad and vulnerable, as Adam talks.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          The truth is there's a girl I need
          to go see. We have plans to spend
          the rest of our lives together.
          And I can't wait any longer.
          (listening to himself)
          And I'm totally cool with it.
          Adam smiles, feeling the rush of knowing he's ready. But
          then he sees how sad Jennie is. He moves closer to her.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)
          One day, you're going to find the
          right guy who's willing to give up
          everything and travel across time
          and space for your love.
          She nods and tears up a little bit, as Adam HUGS her.

                         JENNIE

                         (EMOTIONAL)
          I would totally blow you right now.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          94.

                         ADAM
          I know you would.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - LATER THAT AFTERNOON

          The guys stare at the tub, which continues to bubble, even
          though it's not plugged in.

                         NICK
          We don't have to go yet, Adam.
          Things are just getting fun.

                         JACOB
          And we can do whatever we want
          without any real consequences.
          That's a lot to give up.

                         ADAM

                         (NODS)
          That's how I know I'm doing the
          right thing.
          Adam reaches in his backpack, but can't find the Red Bull.
          He turns it inside out and shakes it -- nothing.

                         JACOB
          Where's the Red Bull?

          BLAINE (V.0.)
          You looking for this?
          Across the patio, a drunk, disheveled Blaine holds the CAN.

                         BLAINE (CONT'D)
          You couldn't leave well enough
          alone, could ya? You couldn't just
          win the race and call it a day?
          You had to have Jennie too.

                         ADAM
          I don't want Jennie.

                         BLAINE
          That's funny. I don't want this
          soda, either.
          Blaine smiles like an asshole. Adam's face goes desperate,
          as Blaine OPENS THE CAN and DRINKS THE WHOLE THING.

                         ADAM
          Nooooo!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          95.
          Adam runs at Blaine and tackles him to the ground. On the
          ground, Adam BEATS THE LIVING HELL out of Blaine, messing up
          his face. It makes the Jared Leto scene from Fight Club look
          tame. Eventually, Adam's friends pull him off.
          Adam crawls to the Red Bull can and it's empty.

                         ADAM (CONT'D)

                         (DESPERATE)
          Why?
          Lou takes Blaine's pulse.

                         LOU
          Holy shit! You may have killed
          this guy! No wait... wait... I've
          got a pulse. Eh, so much for that.
          Nick puts his hand on Adam's shoulder.

                         NICK
          I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry.

                         ADAM
          The Red Bull's gone. He fucked us.

                         JACOB
          Not necessarily.
          Everyone looks toward Jacob.

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          The Red Bull isn't really gone.
          (points to Blaine)
          It's in him.
          A beat, as everyone sorta gets it.

                         NICK
          It's worth a shot.

          TIME CUT TO:

          EXT. PINE VALLEY INN / PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

          Adam, Nick, and Jacob sit in the tub. Adam crosses his
          fingers.
          Lou stands outside the tub, fully dressed.

                         ADAM
          Come on, Lou.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          96.

                         LOU
          Nah, I'll take a rain check.

                         NICK
          What are you talking about?

                         LOU
          Listen, your lives at home sound
          all beautiful and happy with your
          barbecues and swimming pools and
          "oh, that sandwich reminds of some
          gay shit I did one time."
          Adam and Nick don't look thrilled to be reduced to this.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          But my life back there sucks. And
          in case you haven't noticed, my
          life here fucking rules. So I have
          a coke problem? I'll go to rehab.
          I have no money? I'll stop winning
          sex and start winning dollars.
          Lou DRAGS BLAINE by the foot closer to the tub.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          Guys, I was tailor-made for 1987.
          And you'll excuse me, but I value
          banging young chicks way more than
          all of your friendships combined.

                         (THEN)
          No offense.
          Adam, Nick, and Jacob kinda nod and understand.

                         ADAM
          Yeah, no, I get it.
          Lou goes around and gives them all hugs.

                         NICK
          Makes perfect sense, man.
          Lou squeezes Jacob's shoulder.

                         LOU
          I don't hate you as much as I used
          to.

                         JACOB
          (a little emotional)
          I hate you a little less also.
          Lou LIFTS BLAINE'S LIMP BODY.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          97.

                         ADAM
          OK, whenever you're ready, Lou.

                         LOU
          One small step for man! One giant
          asshole puking in a hot tub! Here
          goes nothing!
          Lou does the HEIMLICH MANEUVER on Blaine. It takes ONE...
          TWO... THREE THRUSTS until Blaine PUKES IN THE TUB! For a
          second, it's just a BIG SPLASH of VOMIT and nothing else.

                         NICK
          OK, well maybe if we--
          A BRIGHT FLASH CONSUMES THE SCREEN! And when it dies down,
          we see Adam, Nick, Jacob (and the floating puke) in the hot
          tub where we left them.
          Only Lou is missing.

                         ADAM
          What happened? Did it work?

                         NICK
          I didn't feel anything.

                         JACOB

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Guys, look.
          They see PEOPLE walking by, wearing COLORFUL FLARED-OUT SKI
          ATTIRE. The place looks the same as it did two seconds ago.

                         NICK
          Dammit. Even the deck furniture's
          the same. We fucking blew it. It
          didn't work.

                         ADAM
          Where's Lou?

          LOU (O.S.)
          Right on schedule!
           Lou walks toward them, but there's a lot that's "off" about
           him, including HAIR PLUGS, JEWELRY, and a SHITLOAD OF PLASTIC
          SURGERY (including a fixed NOSE) that makes him look at once
          older and younger.

                         NICK
          Ahhh!

                         

                         

                         

                         

          98.

                         LOU
          Oh, the face, eh? I was curious
          how you'd react.

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Didn't think you'd be scared.

                         ADAM
          Lou?

                         LOU
          You're damn right it's me.

                         ADAM
          What happened?

                         LOU
          You just traveled 23 years in three
          seconds. Took me 23 years. It's
          good to see you guys!

                         JACOB
          We're back? It all looks the same.

                         LOU
          It better! You know how much I pay
          the groundspeople around here? A
          lot. But that's all right, I'm
          fucking loaded. Look at all this.
          Everyone looks confused.

                         ADAM
          Will you fill in some of the blanks
          for me, please?

                         LOU
          I'll give you the short version,
          because time is of the essence.
          First of all, to settle an old bet,
          time most definitely has been
          moving forward. It is exactly
          three days since you've arrived
          here in beautiful Havenhurst.
          Jacob looks at Nick.

                         JACOB
          Told you.

                         LOU
          Secondly, I'm filthy rich. Made
          sports bets. Sued Ace of Base. I
          own most of V
          ermont. (MORE)

                         

                         

                         

                         

          99.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          I've been reimagining the state as
          my own personal playground. You
          could say I'm a little bit like
          Michael Jackson, except I don't
          fuck kids.
          Two YOUNG HOTTIES walk by and wave at Lou.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          I do fuck them, though. Haven't
          gone above 24 years old in 10 years
          and even then, it was a mistake.

                         (REMEMBERING)
          A horrible mistake.

                         ADAM
          Wait, fuck, Lou what time is it?

                         LOU
          Way ahead of you, Adam. You have 2
          hours to get to New Jersey in time
          for your rehearsal dinner.

                         ADAM

                         (DISAPPOINTED)
          Great, I blew it.

                         LOU
          Not even a little bit. I have a
          helicopter waiting in the parking
          lot and a private jet on my
          airfield five minutes away.
          The guys look stunned.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          I had some time to plan. God, it's
          good to have you guys back!

          EXT. PRIVATE AIRFIELD - AFTERNOON

          Lou's private jet takes off from the runway.

          INT. PRIVATE JET - AFTERNOON

          The guys sit back and enjoy the plush surroundings and the
          beautiful FLIGHT ATTENDANTS aboard Lou's jet.

                         LOU
          By the way, Adam, I hope you don't
          mind. Right after you left, I
          fucked Jennie silly.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          100.

                         ADAM
          Why would she have sex with you?

                         LOU
          You get the big time assist. All
          that talk of her finding the right
          guy who's willing to give up
          everything? Made her wetter than a
          log flume.

                         (SMILES)
          She's all-time top five.

                         ADAM
          Good to hear.

                         NICK
          Lou, I gotta ask you something.

                         LOU
          Time travel paradox.

                         NICK
          Exactly. Aren't there now two of
          you living here in 2010?

                         LOU
          Think really hard about that one.
          What happened to me when I was 19?
          Nick shrugs. He looks at Adam. Suddenly, both their eyes
          nearly pop out of their skulls.

                         NICK
          No way...

                         ADAM
          You went missing and were never
          found.

                         LOU
          Yeah, you're gonna have some
          lingering memories of both
          versions.

                         ADAM
          Wait a minute, what happened to...
          you know. Other Lou.

                         LOU
          You don't wanna know.

                         ADAM
          Lou...

                         LOU
          The kid sucked, OK? He couldn't
          take even a little bit of
          direction. Pretty soon I realized
          that having two versions of the
          same dude walking around -- as cool
          as that sounds -- didn't make very
          much sense to me.

                         NICK

          OK?

                         LOU
          So I took care of the problem.

                         NICK
          What did you do?

                         LOU
          I had to do it.

                         ADAM
          What did you do?

                         LOU
          I killed myself.

                         ADAM
          Jesus Christ.

                         LOU
          Yeah, it was really some
          existential shit. I mean, here I
          am committing homicide and I'm
          actually committing suicide.

                         NICK
          How could you?

                         LOU
          It was easy actually. For a
          minute, I thought I might be
          dealing with that whole Timecop
          thing. You know, the same matter
          can't occupy the same space at the
          same time bullshit and we both go
          poof? Especially after that whole
          nose thing. But no, it was just a
          murder. I didn't suffer.

                         ADAM
          I don't wanna hear any more.

                         

                         

                         

                         

          102.

                         LOU
          It was strangulation.

                         ADAM
          I don't wanna hear any more!
          They sit in horrified silence for a bit.

                         LOU
          You'll have to introduce me when we
          get there. Your families won't
          know me. Although I'm sure they're
          huge fans.

                         (ABRUPT)
          So hey, getting married, huh?
          Taking the plunge!
          Adam looks disturbed. Nick looks confused.

          This makes no sense at all.

          Lily looks beautiful, surrounded by FAMILY and FRIENDS.
          Still, she looks distant and lonely. Until --
          A LILY (the flower) comes into frame.
          Lily smiles and stands up. She turns around. Adam's
          standing there with a whole bouquet of flowers. Lily gives
          him a BIG HUG AND KISS. When she's done:

                         LILY
          Don't you ever let me take your
          phone again!

          promised.

          I'm so happy to see you and I can't
          wait to spend the rest of my life

          Oh my god, what happened?

          LOU (O.S.)
          My fault entirely, madam!
          The room is ABUZZ with CHATTER, as Lou makes a nearly REGAL
          ENTRANCE, wearing a WHITE TUXEDO.

          GUY AT TABLE
          Hey, it's Lou Blustein!
          The whole room APPLAUDS Lou, as he walks in. Adam and the
          guys can't believe it.

                         LOU
          I was partaking in a little ski
          adventure and I mistakenly wandered
          into your fiance's path. His
          broken leg is my broken heart. My
          most humble apologies.
          Lou scrapes and bows and regally kisses Lily's hand. She
          looks genuinely flattered.
          Lou gets up and whispers to Adam.

                         LOU (CONT'D)
          See? I'm awesome here. You
          shoulda stayed out of that tub.

          I was thinking we'd invite Adam and
          Lily over for dinner when they get
          back from their honeymoon.
          That's... if it's OK with you?

          So... how are your parents?

                         COURTNEY
          Still working hard. I really wish
          they could retire already, but it's
          tough competing with the big

                         JACOB (CONT'D)
          The Japanese have apparently
          cornered the technology sector over
          the past 20 years. We've dealt
          American businesses quite an
          irreparable blow.

                         ADAM
          What does that mean for us?

                         JACOB
          Pretty much nothing for us
          personally. We just get cooler
          phones and iPods and shit.

          Oh. Great!

          can't help but beam from ear to ear.

          You're so beautiful.

          I know you were only gone for a
          couple days, but I missed you so
          much.
          Adam takes her hand.

                         ADAM
          Come on, let's get out of here. We
          have unfinished business.
          Lily smiles. She gets into it.

          It's about time. OK, what's the
          fantasy?

          straight out of the water.

          This, is Berk. It's twelve days
          North of hopeless, and a few

          It's located solidly on the
          meridian of misery.

          My village. In a word, sturdy.
          And it's been here for seven
          generations, but every single

          The camera drifts closer, circling.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          We have fishing, hunting, and a
          charming view of the sunsets. The
          only problems are the pests. You
          see, most places have mice or

          Like our charming Viking demeanor
          wouldn't do that.
          Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the
          Vikings who throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an
          explosion, knocking Hiccup to the ground.

                         VIKING

          Arggghhhhh!

          Mornin'!
          Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to rush past gigantic
          men and women.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Meet the neighbors. Hoark the
          Haggard...

                         HOARK
          What are you doing out!?

                         HICCUP
          . Ack.
          He passes a silent ox of a viking, picking his ear.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yep, just Ack.
          Enter STOICK, the biggest Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from
          the path of a strafing dragon and holds aloft to the crowd.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup!?
          (accusingly; to the crowd)
          What is he doing out again?!

                         (TO HICCUP)
          What are you doing out?! Get
          inside!
          The flames light up his scowling face and matted red beard.
          He sets Hiccup down and turns to the sky, searching.

          HICCUP (V.O.)

                         (IN AWE)
          That's Stoick the Vast. Chief of
          the tribe. They say that when he
          was a baby he popped a dragon's
          head clean off of its shoulders.
          Do I believe it?
          Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the
          strafing dragon out of the sky.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Yes I do.
          An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to DUCK. Stoick stands firm,
          brushing flaming debris off of his shoulder.

                         STOICK
          (barking; to his men)
          What have we got?

                         VIKING #1
          Gronkles. Nadders. Zipplebacks. Oh,
          and Hoark saw a Monstrous
          Nightmare.

                         STOICK
          Any Night Furies?

                         VIKING #1

                         (RELIEVED)
          Good.

                         VIKING
          Hoist the torches!
          Massive flaming braziers are raised on poles, lighting up the
          night sky... and revealing swirling dragons of all types.
          Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into an open
          building with a tall chimney.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - CONTINUOUS

          He crosses behind a counter, where a peg-legged, one-armed
          hulk of a Blacksmith reshapes blades with a hammer and tongs
          appendage.

                         GOBBER
          Ah! Nice of you to join the party.
          I thought you'd been carried off.
          Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put away Gobber's
          scattered appendages.

                         HICCUP
          Who me? Nah, come on! I'm way too
          muscular for their taste. They
          wouldn't know what to do with all
          this.
          Hiccup strikes a bodybuilder pose.

                         GOBBER
          They need toothpicks, don't they?
          Hiccup gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to
          the forge as Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          The meathead with attitude and
          interchangeable hands is Gobber.
          I've been his apprentice ever since
          I was little. Well...littler.

                         ON STOICK

                         STOICK
          We move to the lower defenses.
          We'll counter-attack with the
          catapults.

          Armed men rush past, flanking others who carry sheep to
          safety. Stoick follows up the rear as, overhead, a dragon
          strafes the rooftops with Napalm-like fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          See? Old village. Lots and lots
          of new houses.

                         VIKING

          FIRE!
          In response, the fire brigade charges through the plaza --
          four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
          they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among
          them is a cute, energetic Viking girl.
          Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch her.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh and that's Fishlegs, Snotlout.
          The twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut.
          And...

                         (DREAMY)
          Astrid.
          A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her in a
          sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
          heroic.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Their job is so much cooler.
          Hiccup tries to join them as they pass, but he's hooked by
          Gobber and hoisted back inside.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEADING)
          Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I
          need to make my mark.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you've made plenty of marks.
          All in the wrong places.

                         HICCUP
          Please, two minutes. I'll kill a
          dragon. My life will get infinitely
          better. I might even get a date.

                         GOBBER
          You can't lift a hammer. You can't
          swing an axe...
          Gobber grabs a bola (iron balls connected by rope).

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... you can't even throw one of
          these.
          A Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber's hand, hurling it
          at a dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending
          it into a heavy crash.

                         HICCUP
          (ready with the answer)
          Okay fine, but...
          He rushes to the back corner of the stall and presents a
          bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... this will throw it for me.
          Hiccup OPENS the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up,
          equipped with twin bows. They prematurely launch a bola,
          narrowly missing Gobber... and taking out a Viking at the
          counter.

                         VIKING
          Arggh!

                         GOBBER
          See, now this right here is what
          I'm talking about.

                         HICCUP
          Mild calibration issue.

                         GOBBER
          Hiccup. If you ever want to get out
          there to fight dragons, you need
          to stop all...
          Gobber gestures in Hiccup's general direction.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          ... this.

                         (ASTONISHED)
          But... you just pointed to all of
          me.

                         GOBBER
          Yes! That's it! Stop being all of
          you.

                         GOBBER

                         (MIMICKING)
          Ohhhhh, yes.

                         HICCUP
          You, sir, are playing a dangerous
          game. Keeping this much,
          raw...Vikingness contained.

                         (BEAT)
          There will be consequences!
          Gobber tosses him a sword.

                         GOBBER
          I'll take my chances. Sword.
          Sharpen. Now.
          Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding
          wheel. He stews... fantasizing...

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          One day I'll get out there. Because
          killing a dragon is everything
          around here.

          EXT. VILLAGE - LOWER PLAINS - CONTINUOUS

          Nadders land, gathering like seagulls around a seemingly
          vacant house.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          A Nadder head is sure to get me at
          least noticed.
          The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
          walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER.
          Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles pick drying racks clean of
          fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Gronckles are tough. Taking down
          one of those would definitely get
          me a girlfriend.
          A stealthy, snake-like dragon head peeks over a rooftop,
          breathing gas into a chimney.

          A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two
          heads, twice the status.
          A second head pokes through the door and lights it. KABLAM!
          The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
          together to reveal a single body.
          It flies past Stoick as he climbs to the top of a CATAPULT

          TOWER.

                         CATAPULT OPERATOR
          They found the sheep!

          Fire!
          Boulders are catapulted at the corralling Nadders...
          Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying the base of
          the catapult with sticky fire.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          And then there's the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Only the best Vikings go
          after those. They have this nasty
          habit of setting themselves on
          fire.
          It emerges from the flames, climbing the catapult with a
          leering, toothy grin.

                         STOICK
          Reload! I'll take care of this.
          Stoick takes on the Nightmare, face to hammer.
          Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING streaks overhead. The
          catapult crew ducks.

          Vikings everywhere take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.

          EXT. VILLAGE - CATAPULT - CONTINUOUS

          The Monstrous Nightmare suddenly stops fighting and takes
          flight. Stoick looks skyward.

                         STOICK

          JUMP!
          KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit by an artillery
          shell... sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their lives.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          This thing never steals food, never
          shows itself, and...
          The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in flames.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          ...never misses.

          Gobber trades his hammer for an axe.

                         GOBBER
          Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me
          out there!
          Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Stay. Put. There. You know what I
          mean.
          Gobber charges into the fray, HOLLERING.
          ON HICCUP, a smirk crosses his face.

          EXT. VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

          WHAM! Hiccup pushes his wheeled contraption through a wall of
          clustered Vikings. He weaves through the ongoing mayhem, as
          fast as his legs can carry him.

          Come back here!

                         HICCUP
          I know. Be right back!

          ON THE PLAIN BELOW
          The Nadders have cornered the house-full of sheep. They close
          in, ready to spring upon them.
          Stoick suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The
          surprised Nadders are caught. Stoick and his men rush in.
          A Nadder blasts a hole through its net. Stoick leaps onto it,
          clamping his thick arms around its head, forcing its jaws
          shut.

                         STOICK
          Mind yourselves! The devils still
          have some juice in them.

          ON THE PLAIN ABOVE
          Hiccup reaches a cliff overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and
          drops the handles to the ground. He cranks several levers,
          unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his contraption.
          He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon on
          a gimbal head toward the dark sky.
          He listens, with his eye pressed to the scope, hand poised on
          the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY approaching... and turns
          his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for the final
          strike, completely camouflaged in the night.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO HIMSELF)
          Come on. Give me something to shoot
          at, give me something to shoot at.
          KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
          dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger.
          KERTHUNK! The flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon
          off the ground. The bola disappears into the sky, followed by
          a WHACK and a SCREECH.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (surprised, then elated)
          Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did
          anybody see that?
          Hiccup's victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare
          appears, slithering up over the lip of the cliff.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Except for you.
          ON STOICK, holding down the netted Nadders. He hears a
          familiar HOLLER and looks up to see...
          HICCUP running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the
          NIGHTMARE fast on his heels.
          Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.

                         STOICK
          (to his men, re: the

                         NADDERS)
          DO NOT let them escape!

          IN THE PLAZA
          Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a near fatal blast. The
          Nightmare's sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up onto
          buildings, setting them alight.
          Hiccup ducks behind the last standing brazier -- the only
          shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it, spraying fire all
          around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post. No sign
          of the Nightmare.
          He turns back to find it leering at him, blocking his escape.
          It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
          Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare
          to the ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their
          earlier fight. The Nightmare tries to toast him, but only
          coughs up smoke.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You're all out.
          He smashes the Nightmare repeatedly in the face, driving it
          away. It takes to the air and disappears. Winded, Stoick
          turns to Hiccup.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Oh, and there's one more thing you
          need to know...

          The burnt brazier pole collapses, sending the massive iron
          basket crashing. It bounces down the hill, destroying as it
          goes and scattering the Vikings who were holding down the
          netted Nadders. The freed dragons escape... with several
          sheep in tow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry, dad.

          EXT. VILLAGE - UPPER PLAZA - CONTINUOUS

          The escaped Nadders fly past with sheep in their clutches.
          The raid is over. The dragons have clearly won.
          The murmuring crowd eyes Stoick, awaiting his response.

                         HICCUP

                         (SHEEPISH)
          Okay, but I hit a Night Fury.
          Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back scruff of his collar and
          hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's not like the last few times,
          Dad. I mean I really actually hit
          it. You guys were busy and I had a
          very clear shot. It went down, just
          off Raven Point. Let's get a search
          party out there, before it--

                         STOICK
          --STOP! Just....stop.
          He releases Hiccup. Everyone goes silent, staring
          expectantly.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Every time you step outside,
          disaster follows. Can you not see
          that I have bigger problems?
          Winter's almost here and I have an
          entire village to feed!
          Hiccup looks around. All eyes are upon him.

                         HICCUP
          Between you and me, the village
          could do with a little less
          feeding, don't ya think?
          A few rotund Vikings stir self-consciously.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 13.

                         STOICK
          This isn't a joke, Hiccup!

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Why can't you follow the simplest
          orders?

                         HICCUP
          I can't stop myself. I see a dragon
          and I have to just... kill it, you
          know? It's who I am, Dad.

                         STOICK
          You are many things, Hiccup. But a
          dragon killer is not one of them.
          Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods of agreement.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get back to the house.

                         (TO GOBBER)
          Make sure he gets there. I have his
          mess to clean up.
          Stoick lumbers off in the opposite direction.
          Gobber leads Hiccup through the walk of shame. They pass the
          teen fire brigade as they snicker.

                         TUFFNUT
          Quite the performance.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I've never seen anyone mess up that
          badly. That helped!

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, thank you. I was
          trying, so...
          Hiccup avoids Astrid's glare and heads up toward a large
          house, standing prominently on the hill above the others.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I really did hit one.

                         GOBBER
          Sure, Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          He never listens.

                         GOBBER
          Well, it runs in the family.

                         HICCUP
          And when he does, it's always with
          this... disappointed scowl. Like
          someone skimped on the meat in his
          sandwich.

                         (MIMICKING STOICK)
          Excuse me, barmaid. I'm afraid you
          brought me the wrong offspring. I
          ordered an extra large boy with
          beefy arms. Extra guts and glory on
          the side. This here. This is a
          talking fish bone.

                         GOBBER
          You're thinking about this all
          wrong. It's not so much what you
          look like. It's what's inside that
          he can't stand.
          Beat.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you, for summing that up.
          They reach the doorway.

                         GOBBER
          Look, the point is, stop trying so
          hard to be something you're not.
          Hiccup SIGHS heavily.

                         HICCUP
          I just want to be one of you guys.
          Gobber eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes
          through the front door.
          And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the
          woods, determined.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY

          A noisy din of PROTESTING VOICES leads to...
          STOICK, glowering in the firelight. Surrounded by his men.

                         STOICK
          Either we finish them or they'll
          finish us! It's the only way we'll
          be rid of them! If we find the
          nest and destroy it, the dragons
          will leave. They'll find another
          home.

          He sinks his blade into a...
          LARGE NAUTICAL MAP, spread out on the table... the blade
          pierces the middle of an uncharted corner, swirling with
          painted sea monsters and dragons.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (DECIDEDLY)
          One more search. Before the ice
          sets in.

                         VIKING
          Those ships never come back.

                         STOICK

                         (MATTER-OF-FACT)
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard. Now who's with me?
          Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts
          in restless silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.

                         VIKING

                         (FEEBLE)
          Today's not good for me.

          VIKING (CONT'D)

                         (EQUALLY FEEBLE)
          I've gotta do my axe returns.

                         STOICK
          Alright. Those who stay will look
          after Hiccup.
          Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic
          murmurs of prep and packing fill the room.

          PHLEGMA THE FIERCE
          To the ships!

                         SPITELOUT
          I'm with you Stoick!

                         STOICK

                         (DRY)
          That's more like it.
          The Vikings rush for the door, leaving Gobber and Stoick
          alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
          attachment and scrapes back the bench.

                         GOBBER
          I'll pack my undies.

                         STOICK
          No, I need you to stay and train
          some new recruits.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, perfect. And while I'm busy,
          Hiccup can cover the stall. Molten
          steel, razor sharp blades, lots of
          time to himself...what could
          possibly go wrong?
          Stoick sinks onto the bench beside Gobber, his brow burdened.

                         STOICK
          What am I going to do with him
          Gobber?

                         GOBBER
          Put him in training with the
          others.

                         STOICK
          No, I'm serious.

                         GOBBER
          So am I.
          Stoick turns to him, glaring.

                         STOICK
          He'd be killed before you let the
          first dragon out of its cage.

                         GOBBER
          Oh, you don't know that.

                         STOICK
          I do know that, actually.

                         GOBBER
          No, you don't.

                         STOICK
          No, actually I do.

                         GOBBER
          No you don't!

                         STOICK
          Listen! You know what he's like.
          From the time he could crawl he's
          been...different. He doesn't
          listen.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          Has the attention span of a
          sparrow. I take him fishing and he
          goes hunting for... for trolls.

                         GOBBER

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          Trolls exist! They steal your
          socks.

                         (DARKLY)
          But only the left ones. What's with
          that?

                         STOICK
          When I was a boy...

                         GOBBER

                         (GRUMBLING)
          Oh here we go.

                         STOICK
          My father told me to bang my head
          against a rock and I did it. I
          thought it was crazy, but I didn't
          question him. And you know what
          happened?

                         GOBBER
          You got a headache.

                         STOICK
          That rock split in two. It taught
          me what a Viking could do, Gobber.
          He could crush mountains, level
          forests, tame seas! Even as a boy,
          I knew what I was, what I had to
          become.

                         (BEAT)
          Hiccup is not that boy.

                         GOBBER
          You can't stop him, Stoick. You can
          only prepare him.

                         (BEAT)
          Look, I know it seems hopeless. But
          the truth is you won't always be
          around to protect him. He's going
          to get out there again. He's
          probably out there now.
          ON STOICK, as Gobber's words hit their mark.

          EXT. WOODS - DAY


          ON AN OPEN NOTEBOOK

          A drawn map of the island, covered in X's.
          Hiccup looks up from it and peeks over a gorge, expectantly.
          Sees nothing.
          He adds another 'X' to the page, then scratches his pencil
          over the whole map in frustration. He snaps the book closed
          and pockets it.

                         HICCUP
          Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people
          lose their knife or their mug. No,
          not me. I manage to lose an entire
          dragon.
          Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him,
          hitting him in the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree
          trunk. His eyes follow it to a long trench of up-turned
          earth.
          He follows it to a downed, black dragon, its body and tail
          tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup approaches,
          beaming.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (IN SHOCK)
          Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This
          fixes everything.

                         (ELATED)
          Yes!
          He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen
          Night Fury.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I have brought down this mighty
          beast!
          It suddenly shifts.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Whoa!
          Hiccup springs back, terrified. He turns his blade on it.
          Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the weak, wounded
          dragon, dagger poised to strike.
          As he reaches the head, Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring
          coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look away, but he's drawn back
          to its unnerving, unflinching stare.
          With the dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with
          his dagger, puffing himself up with false bravado.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm going to kill you, Dragon. I'm
          gonna cut out your heart and take
          it to my father. I'm a Viking.

                         (BEAT)
          I am a VIKING!
          Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove his Viking-
          ness. The dragon's labored breathing breaks Hiccup's clenched
          concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through.
          The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged.
          Finally, the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head,
          resigned to its fate.
          Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger
          aloft... fighting himself... until finally lowering it with a
          frustrated sigh.
          He looks over the dragon's chaffed rope wounds.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (muttered, ashamed)
          I did this.
          He turns to leave. Pauses. And glances back at the dragon,
          chest heaving.
          Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks over his shoulder to ensure that
          no one is watching... then hurries back to cut the ropes.
          The Night Fury's eye shoots open. With the dragon watching
          his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
          As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES!
          In a blur, the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down,
          grazing his neck. Looking like it's about to kill him. Hiccup
          is paralyzed. The dragon's breath ruffles his hair. Hiccup
          opens his eyes to find the Night Fury's wolf-like stare
          boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound.
          The dragon draws a deep breath, as though it's about to torch
          him, then lets out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns
          and takes flight, flapping violently through the canopy of
          trees. It bashes against a nearby mountain side, recovers,
          and drops out of view some distance away.
          Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps,
          collapses to his knees, and faints.

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup enters to see...

          STOICK, seated on a thick slice of tree-trunk. He is slouched
          over the fire-pit, stirring the coals with his axe. Embers
          waft around his beard.
          Hiccup tries to sneak past, up the stairs to his room. Stoick
          seems none the wiser, when...

                         STOICK
          Hiccup.

                         HICCUP

                         (CAUGHT)
          Dad. Uh...
          Stoick stands, takes a deep breath.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I, uh... I have to talk to you,
          Dad.

                         STOICK
          I need to speak with you too, son.
          Hiccup and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment.

                         HICCUP STOICK
          I've decided I don't want to I think it's time you learn
          fight dragons. to fight dragons.

                         (BEAT) (BEAT)
          What? What?

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You go first.

                         HICCUP
          No, you go first.

                         STOICK
          Alright. You get your wish. Dragon
          training. You start in the morning.

                         HICCUP

                         (SCRAMBLING)
          Oh man, I should've gone first. Uh,
          'cause I was thinking, you know we
          have a surplus of dragon-fighting
          Vikings, but do we have enough
          bread-making Vikings, or small home

                         REPAIR VIKINGS--

                         STOICK
          --You'll need this.
          Stoick hands Hiccup his axe. Hiccup avoids taking it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 21.

                         HICCUP
          I don't want to fight dragons.

                         STOICK
          Come on. Yes, you do.

                         HICCUP
          Rephrase. Dad I can't kill dragons.

                         STOICK
          But you will kill dragons.

                         HICCUP
          No, I'm really very extra sure that
          I won't.

                         STOICK
          It's time Hiccup.

                         HICCUP
          Can you not hear me?

                         STOICK
          This is serious son!
          Stoick forces the axe into Hiccup's hands. Its weight drags
          him down. He looks up to see Stoick under-lit with firelight.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          When you carry this axe... you
          carry all of us with you. Which
          means you walk like us. You talk
          like us. You think like us. No more
          of...

                         (GESTURING NON-
          specifically at Hiccup)
          ... this.

                         HICCUP
          You just gestured to all of me.

                         STOICK
          Deal?

                         HICCUP
          This conversation is feeling very
          one-sided.

                         STOICK

          DEAL?!
          Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It's a no-win
          argument.

                         HICCUP

                         (RESIGNED)
          Deal.
          Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag... and
          heads for the door.

                         STOICK
          Good. Train hard. I'll be back.
          Probably.

                         HICCUP
          And I'll be here. Maybe.
          Stoick heads out the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          Gobber raises a massive iron gate at the entrance of a vast
          stone arena.

                         GOBBER
          Welcome to dragon training!
          The recruits file through the gate, and out onto the arena
          floor. They take it in like gladiators entering the
          colosseum. The walls are covered in scorched silhouettes of
          blasted Vikings. It's a grim yet awe-inspiring place.

                         ASTRID
          No turning back.

                         TUFFNUT
          I hope I get some serious burns.

                         RUFFNUT
          I'm hoping for some mauling, like
          on my shoulder or lower back.

                         ASTRID
          Yeah, it's only fun if you get a
          scar out of it.

          HICCUP (O.S.)
          Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love
          it.
          The recruits turn to see Hiccup behind them. Groans all
          around.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oh great. Who let him in?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 23.

                         GOBBER
          Let's get started! The recruit who
          does best will win the honor of
          killing his first dragon in front
          of the entire village.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Hiccup already killed a Night Fury,
          so does that disqualify him or...?
          The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the background.

                         TUFFNUT
          Can I transfer to the class with
          the cool Vikings?
          Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him
          along.

                         GOBBER
          (cheery, in confidence)
          Don't worry. You're small and
          you're weak. That'll make you less
          of a target. They'll see you as
          sick or insane and go after the
          more Viking-like teens instead.
          GOBBER stick him in line with the others and continues on
          toward five massive reinforced doors. Terrible ROARS and
          BELLOWS issue from within.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Behind these doors are just a few
          of the many species you will learn
          to fight.
          Fishlegs bounces and giggles with excitement, barely able to
          contain himself.

                         GOBBER (CONT'D)
          The Deadly Nadder.

                         FISHLEGS
          (under his breath)
          Speed eight. Armor sixteen.

                         GOBBER
          The Hideous Zippleback.

                         FISHLEGS
          Plus eleven stealth. Times two.

                         GOBBER
          The Monstrous Nightmare.

                         FISHLEGS
          Firepower fifteen.

                         GOBBER
          The Terrible Terror.

                         FISHLEGS
          Attack eight. Venom twelve.

                         GOBBER

          CAN YOU STOP THAT?!

                         (BEAT)
          And...the Gronckle.

                         FISHLEGS
          (quietly; to himself)
          Jaw strength, eight.
          Gobber pulls a lever, raising the cross beam on the last of
          the doors.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Whoa, wait! Aren't you gonna teach
          us first!?

                         GOBBER
          I believe in learning on the job.
          BAM! A GRONCKLE thunders out of its cave, charging into the
          ring like an irate rhino.
          The recruits scramble in every direction. Except for Ruffnut
          and Tuffnut who rush toward it, like pumped-up rodeo clowns.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Today is about survival. If you get
          blasted, you're dead. Quick, what's
          the first thing you're going to
          need?

                         HICCUP
          A doctor?

                         FISHLEGS
          Plus five speed?

                         ASTRID
          A shield.

                         GOBBER
          Shields. Go.
          The recruits scramble for shields, finding them scattered
          around the ring.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 25.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Your most important piece of
          equipment is your shield. If you
          must make a choice between a sword
          or a shield, take the shield.
          Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him
          running.
          Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has
          a skull painted on it. They both grab it.

                         TUFFNUT
          Get your hands off my shield!

                         RUFFNUT
          There are like a million shields!

                         TUFFNUT
          Take that one, it has a flower on
          it. Girls like flowers.
          Ruffnut uses the shield to BASH Tuffnut in the face. He
          doesn't let go.

                         RUFFNUT
          Ooops, now this one has blood on
          it.
          The Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The
          shield is blasted out of both of their hands. Tuff and Ruff
          SPIN like tops and go down.

                         GOBBER
          Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you're out!

                         TUFFNUT

                         (DAZED)
          What?!

                         RUFFNUT

                         (CONFUSED)
          What?!
          The Gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and SWALLOWS them
          back. The teens gather on the far side of the ring.

                         GOBBER
          Those shields are good for another
          thing. Noise. Make lots of it to
          throw off a dragon's aim.
          The kids scoop up weapons and begin hammering on their
          shields. The Gronckle shakes its head at the clatter.

          GRONCKLE'S POV - the teens targets become blurry and
          scrambled. It's working.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          All dragons have a limited number
          of shots. How many does a Gronckle
          have?

                         SNOTLOUT
          Five!

                         FISHLEGS
          No, six.

                         GOBBER
          Correct, six. That's one for each
          of you!

                         FISHLEGS
          I really don't think my parents

                         WOULD--
          BAM! Fishlegs has his shield blasted away.

                         GOBBER
          Fishlegs, out.
          Gobber spots Hiccup hiding from the Gronckle's molten slugs.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Hiccup, get in there!
          ON ASTRID bouncing on her heels, ready to dodge a blast.
          Snotlout appears, trying to hit on her.

                         SNOTLOUT
          So anyway I'm moving into my
          parents' basement. You should come
          by sometime to work out. You look
          like you work out--
          She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past
          her and hit Snotlout's shield. He's blasted onto his back.

                         GOBBER
          Snotlout! You're done!
          Astrid ROLLS to a stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly,
          trying to look cool.

                         HICCUP

                         (VOICE BREAKING)
          So, I guess it's just you and me
          huh?

                         ASTRID
          No. Just you.
          Astrid ROLLS away. A split-second later a lava slug knocks
          Hiccup's shield clear off of his arm. Hiccup is exposed.

                         GOBBER
          One shot left!
          Hiccup panics and chases after his shield as it rolls across
          the ring.
          The sudden movement sends the Gronckle chasing after him,
          leaving Astrid in the clear.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)

                         (WORRIED)
          Hiccup!
          The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him
          against the wall. It opens its mouth and cocks its tail,
          ready to fire point-blank.
          Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle's mouth at the last
          second, causing its head to jerk back and fire against the
          stone wall above Hiccup's head.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (rattled, but masking it)
          And that's six!
          Gobber wrestles the irate Gronckle back into his pen.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Go back to bed, ya overgrown
          sausage! You'll get another chance,
          don't you worry.
          Slam! Lock. Gobber turns to the recruits.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Remember... a dragon will always,
          (with a stern look to

                         HICCUP)
          always go for the kill.
          He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks off. Hiccup looks
          overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone wall.

          EXT. WOODS/HIDDEN COVE - DUSK

          HICCUP, battered after another disastrous day in the ring. He
          studies the remnants of the discarded bola... revealing that
          he's back at the scene of the crime.

                         HICCUP

                         (MUTTERED)
          So...why didn't you?
          He drops the bola and presses on in the direction it flew
          off. He drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to an...
          ISOLATED COVE complete with a pristine spring pool. He scans
          the high stone walls... then notices a single black SCALE on
          the ground. He crouches and picks it up, studying it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Well this was stupid.
          SUDDENLY, the NIGHT FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils,
          watching the massive beast struggle to climb the walls. It
          flaps violently, then peels away to a rough landing. The
          dragon is trapped.
          Hiccup grins, excited to see it again, and slips closer.
          He watches as the dragon, exhausted and frustrated, leaps
          into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and again,
          it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily.
          As if remembering to snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather-
          bound book and flips past drawings of weapons to a blank
          page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to record the
          image.
          The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb out of
          the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings.
          The Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the
          water's edge. He spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at
          them... but comes up empty. He lowers his head, looking
          weakened.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (MUTTERED)
          Why don't you just...fly away?
          ON HICCUP as he spots the problem. He adjusts his drawing,
          carefully erasing one half of the dragon's tail. He
          accidentally drops the charcoal stick. It rolls off of the
          rock outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into
          the cove. TINK. TINK. TINK.
          The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They
          exchange a profound, unflinching stare.

          INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT

          A storm is brewing outside. The great doors rattle on their
          hinges.

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Alright. Where did Astrid go wrong
          in the ring today?
          The recruits are seated at a table, eating dinner by the glow
          of the fire pit.

                         ASTRID
          I mistimed my summersault dive. It
          was sloppy. It threw off my
          reverse tumble.
          Eye rolls from the group.

                         RUFFNUT

                         (SARCASTIC)
          Yeah. We noticed.

                         SNOTLOUT
          (grabbing Astrid's hand)
          No, no, you were great. That was
          so 'Astrid'.

                         GOBBER
          She's right, you have to be tough
          on yourselves.
          CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall,
          sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (glaring at Hiccup)
          Where did Hiccup go wrong?
          He tries to take a seat at the table...

                         RUFFNUT
          He showed up.

                         TUFFNUT
          He didn't get eaten.
          ... but the recruits keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes,
          Hiccup sits at the vacant table next to them.

                         ASTRID
          He's never where he should be.

          Thank you, Astrid.
          Gobber stands.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          You need to live and breathe this
          stuff.
          Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          The dragon manual. Everything we
          know about every dragon we know of.
          A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall. Rain pours down outside.

                         GOBBER (CONT'D)
          No attacks tonight. Study up.
          Gobber EXITS into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the
          book.

                         TUFFNUT
          (you've got to be kidding)
          Wait, you mean read?

                         RUFFNUT
          While we're still alive?

                         SNOTLOUT
          Why read words when you can just
          kill the stuff the words tell you
          stuff about?

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh! I've read it like, seven times.
          There's this water dragon that
          sprays boiling water at your face.
          And there's this other one that
          buries itself for like a week...
          The teens stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.

                         TUFFNUT
          Yeah, that sounds great. There was
          a chance I was going to read
          that...

                         RUFFNUT
          ...but now...
          Snotlout gets up to go.

          You guys read, I'll go kill stuff.
          The others follow, with Fishlegs in tow.

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh and there's this other one that
          has these spines that look like
          trees...
          Astrid is the last to go.

                         HICCUP
          So I guess we'll share--

                         ASTRID
          Read it.
          She pushes it toward him and leaves.

                         HICCUP
          All mine then. Wow, so okay. I'll

                         SEE YOU--

          ON HICCUP'S HAND
          OPENING the massive book. Thunder BOOMS outside. The hall is
          vacant and dark, but for the few candles he's pulled
          together.
          Hiccup pours through page after page of strange and
          frightening dragons.

          HICCUP (V.O.)
          Dragon classifications. Strike

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          When startled, the Thunderdrum
          produces a concussive sound that
          can kill a man at close range.
          Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight.
          Hiccup's eyes drift to a lurid illustration of decapitated
          Vikings. Another page, another dragon.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Timberjack. This gigantic creature
          has razor sharp wings that can
          slice through full grown
          trees...extremely dangerous. Kill
          on sight.
          The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own,
          shifting and squirming in the candlelight.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at
          its victim. Extremely dangerous.
          The storm outside rages against the shuttered windows. Hiccup
          is startled, but presses on.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Changewing. Even newly hatched
          dragons can spray acid. Kill on

          He begins flipping through the pages. A blur of dragons...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill.
          Bone Knapper. Whispering Death.

          victims. Chokes its victims. Turns
          its victims inside-out.
          Extremely dangerous. Extremely
          dangerous. Kill on sight. Kill on
          sight. Kill on sight...
          Hiccup finally lands upon the page he's been looking for.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          Night Fury.
          It's BLANK -- no image, save for a few, sparse details.

          Hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of his vest and opens it to
          his drawing of Toothless. He lays it over the book's blank

          A painted DRAGON, with a sword run through it. It's the
          billowing sail of Stoick's ship.
          Stoick hovers over the familiar nautical map -- his eyes on
          the uncharted corner, swirling in mist and illustrations of
          dragons.

          Stoick raises his gaze to...
          AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky to sea like a bruised,
          daunting curtain, beyond which nothing is visible. The three
          ships drift alongside it, skirting its solid edge, looking
          for an opening.
          ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too aware of what

          Sounds of splitting and shattering wood. Plunges into the

                         HICCUP
          You know, I just happened to notice
          the book had nothing on Night
          Furies. Is there another book? Or a
          sequel? Maybe a little Night Fury
          pamphlet?
          KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of Hiccup's hilt,
          leaving a smoking hole behind him. Hiccup YELPS and RUNS.

          FOCUS Hiccup! You're not even
          trying.
          CUT BACK to reveal a Deadly Nadder, loose in a maze-like
          arrangement of moveable walls. Gobber calls orders from
          above.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Today... is all about attack.
          The Nadder hops from wall to wall, sending the recruits

          The teens move in, stumbling over Hiccup and his unwieldy
          shield. The Nadder spots Fishlegs' ample rear hiding behind a
          wall. It whips its tail of spikes. Fishlegs SCREAMS and lifts
          an entire wall to shield himself from the spray.

                         FISHLEGS
          I'm really beginning to question
          your teaching methods.

                         GOBBER
          Look for its blind spot. Every
          dragon has one. Find it, hide in
          it, and strike.

          Ruff and Tuff rush in, diving and rolling up to the Nadder's
          nose. The Nadder sniffs the air -- it can't see them. Tuff
          and Ruff are smashed together - too close for comfort.

                         RUFFNUT

          If you don't like it, then just get
          your own blind spot.

                         RUFFNUT
          How about I give you one!
          Ruff and Tuff SHOVE each other, till their movement and noise
          gives them away. The Nadder ATTACKS, SNAPPING at both of
          them.

                         GOBBER
          Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so
          much.
          Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.

                         HICCUP
          Hey, so how would one sneak up on a
          Night Fury?

                         GOBBER
          None one's ever met one and lived
          to tell the tale. Now get in there.

                         HICCUP
          I know, I know, but
          hypothetically...

                         (WHISPERED)
          Hiccup!
          She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to hide.
          A moment later, the Nadder leaps over the walls, surprising
          them by landing in front of her.
          Astrid somersaults into its blind spot, confusing it. She
          rears back to strike -- just as Snotlout LEAPS IN,
          protectively SWEEPING Astrid behind him.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Watch out babe. I'll take care of
          this.

                         ASTRID
          Hey!
          Snotlout MISSES. Astrid glares at him.

                         SNOTLOUT

                         (DEFENSIVE)
          The sun was in my eyes, Astrid.
          What do you want me to do, block
          out the sun? I could do that, but I
          don't have time right now!
          The Nadder tears off after her, knocking down walls in
          pursuit. She leaps and dives like a highly trained gymnast.
          Hiccup wanders up to Gobber again.

                         HICCUP
          They probably take the daytime off.
          You know, like a cat. Has anyone
          ever seen one napping?

                         GOBBER
          Hiccup!

                         ASTRID
          --Hiccup!
          Hiccup spins around to see the maze walls collapsing like
          dominos toward him. Astrid comes flying through the dust and
          crash-lands on top of him, laying him out in a limb-tangled
          mess.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oooh! Love on the battlefield!

                         RUFFNUT
          She could do better.
          The Nadder closes in, emerging through the cloud of dust.

                         HICCUP
          (struggling to untangle)
          Just... let me... why don't you...
          The Nadder spins around and races back toward them like a
          Raptor.
          Astrid untangles herself and tries to pull her axe from
          Hiccup's shield... which is attached to his limp, gangly arm.
          She PLANTS her foot on his torso and YANKS the axe free,
          still burrowed into the shield.

          She SPINS and SWINGS the axe and shield, scoring a DIRECT HIT
          on the oncoming Nadder's NOSE. It yelps and scurries off.

                         GOBBER
          Well done, Astrid.
          Gobber hobbles off to wrestle the Nadder back into his cave.
          Hiccup gets to his feet -- all eyes are upon him. He turns to
          find Astrid glaring at him, winded.

                         ASTRID
          Is this some kind of a joke to you?
          Our parents' war is about to become
          ours. Figure out which side you're
          on.
          She grabs her axe and stomps off. Hiccup watches, stung.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. COVE - MAGIC HOUR


                         CLOSE ON
          A fish... being thrown into the cove. It hits the ground and
          slides. A moment later, Hiccup peeks through a gap in the
          rock, looking around cautiously. Nothing.
          Hiccup squeezes through and enters the cove.
          A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him.
          Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a
          stealthy panther. It descends, approaching him... ready to
          pounce.
          Hiccup swallows his fear and offers the fish. Doing so
          reveals the dagger at his waist. The dragon sees it and
          hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl. He pauses,
          carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The
          dragon calms.
          As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it's missing
          teeth.

                         HICCUP
          Huh. Toothless. I could've sworn
          you had...
          A set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the
          fish. Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... teeth.
          The teeth retract again.
          Toothless presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup
          retreats nervously.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh, no. No, I don't have any more.
          The Fury backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the
          same position as before. The dragon closes in over him,
          staring blankly.
          A tense moment passes... then Toothless regurgitates a chunk
          of fish onto Hiccup's lap. They exchange stares. Hiccup
          realizes what Toothless wants him to do.
          Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up.
          The dragon waits expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a
          bite of the slimy fish. He forces a smile. Toothless mimics
          him.
          Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries to touch him. Toothless
          HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other side of the
          cove. He BLASTS the mossy ground to a red-hot temperature...
          and curls up on it like a giant dog.
          He turns to find Hiccup seated beside him. Toothless
          tolerates his persistent presence... until Hiccup tries to
          touch his damaged tail. Toothless SNAPS at him. Hiccup takes
          the hint and leaves.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          It's MAGIC HOUR. Toothless wakes, hanging upside down from a
          tree. He spots Hiccup sitting on the other side of the cove.
          Sketching in the sand.
          CLOSE ON a sketch of Toothless. Hiccup draws with a stick,
          minding his own business. Toothless appears behind him,
          watching carefully. Aware of his presence, Hiccup continues,
          trying not to scare him off.
          Toothless walks off. A moment later, he reappears with an
          entire sapling, drawing lines in the sand. He rushes here and
          there, making haphazard lines in every direction.
          Finally, Toothless drops the tree and inspects his work. He
          seems pleased.

          Hiccup stands and takes in the sprawling scribble, amazed by
          it. He accidentally steps onto one of the lines, eliciting an
          instant growl from Toothless. He steps on it again. Toothless
          growls again. Realizing how sensitive he is, Hiccup steps
          carefully between each line, turning round and round until he
          unwittingly bumps into Toothless.
          Toothless snorts. Once again, they're face to face. Hiccup
          slowly extends his hand. Toothless hesitates. Hiccup turns
          his head away and closes his eyes. To his amazement,
          Toothless bridges the gap and presses his muzzle against
          Hiccup's hand.
          In a flash, the dragon is gone, leaving Hiccup astounded.

          EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Gobber and the recruits are seated at the top of an abandoned
          catapult tower, toasting campfire food around a roaring
          bonfire.

                         GOBBER
          ...and with one twist he took my
          hand and swallowed it whole. And I
          saw the look on his face.
          (can't deny it)
          I was delicious. He must have
          passed the word, because it wasn't
          a month before another one of them
          took my leg.

                         FISHLEGS
          Isn't it weird to think that your
          hand was inside a dragon. Like if
          your mind was still in control of
          it you could have killed the dragon
          from the inside by crushing his
          heart or something.

                         SNOTLOUT
          I swear I'm so angry right now.
          I'll avenge your beautiful hand and
          your beautiful foot. I'll chop off
          the legs of every dragon I fight,
          with my face.
          He postures to Astrid. She rolls her eyes.

                         GOBBER
          (with a mouthful)
          Un-unh. It's the wings and the
          tails you really want. If it can't
          fly, it can't get away. A downed
          dragon is a dead dragon.

          ON HICCUP hiding his horrified look form the others.
          Gobber stands and stretches.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Alright. I'm off to bed. You should
          be too. Tomorrow we get into the
          big boys. Slowly but surely making
          our way up to the Monstrous
          Nightmare.
          (playful, taunting)
          But who'll win the honor of killing
          it?
          He hobbles off. The teens reflect.

                         TUFFNUT
          (very matter of fact)
          It's gonna be me.

                         (BEAT)
          It's my destiny. See?
          Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a red dragon on his
          arm.

                         FISHLEGS

                         (GASPS)
          Your mom let you get a tattoo?

                         TUFFNUT
          It's not a tattoo. It's a
          birthmark.

                         RUFFNUT
          Okay, I've been stuck with you
          since birth, and that was never
          there before.

                         TUFFNUT
          Yes it was. You've just never seen
          me from the left side until now.

                         SNOTLOUT
          It wasn't there yesterday. Is it a
          birthmark or a today-mark?
          Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group. Astrid watches
          him as he leaves the bonfire.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - MOMENTS LATER

          Hiccup enters a small room at the back of the stall. It's
          covered in drawings of weaponry and scale models. He lights a
          candle and lays his sketchbook out on the desk, opening it to
          the drawing of Toothless.
          With a look of determination. Hiccup picks up a charcoal
          stick and re-draws the missing tail.

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - LATER


                         CLOSE ON
          ... a creaking leather bellows. The stone forge glows with
          every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the coals.
          They're dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered,
          and dunked in a barrel.
          The pieces are carried to Hiccup's workbench and laid out in
          place on a one-to-one schematic. It's a sketch of a
          mechanical fin.

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DAWN

          Hiccup arrives, winded, straining under the weight of a full
          basket. He clicks the scale he found (like a jar top).
          Toothless approaches, sniffing him.

                         HICCUP
          Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast.
          I hope you're hungry.
          Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill out.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, that's disgusting.
          Toothless approaches, settling in to devour the feast.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh..we've got some salmon...
          Toothless swallows it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... some nice Icelandic cod...
          Swallows those too.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... and a whole smoked eel.
          Toothless nabs it, chews a few times, then spits it out. He
          shakes his head violently, snorts and scrubs his massive
          tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No, no, no! It's okay. Yeah, I
          don't like eel much either.
          Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon
          distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it
          like a fan.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay. That's it. That's it, just
          stick with good stuff. And don't
          you mind me. I'll just be
          back...here. Minding my own
          business.
          Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every time
          he gets near it, Toothless sweeps it away like a cat.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's okay.
          Hiccup drops a knee on top of the tail. Toothless' head juts
          up, slows its chewing to a halt.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay...okay..
          The dragon tenses, slowly spreading his wings. Hiccup straps
          the prosthetic fin in place. He cinches the straps.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PLEASED)
          There. Not too bad. It works.
          Toothless BOLTS! He snaps his massive wings and takes to the
          air, carrying Hiccup with him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Woah! No! No! No!
          Hiccup struggles to hold on to the tail. As the ground speeds
          away, Toothless immediately TIPS into a uncontrolled bank and
          dive.
          Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling uselessly in opposition
          to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may, Toothless can't
          correct his trajectory.

          Hiccup swallows his fear and crawls toward the folded
          prosthetic. He reaches it and YANKS it open. The flared, fan-
          like appendage catches the air, stabilizing the twisting
          tail.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (excited, terrified)
          It's working!
          Toothless arcs just short of the water and climbs... high
          into the air.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yes! Yes, I did it.
          He glances back at Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while
          trying to hold on. They're going to crash.
          Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the
          intense force of a turn.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          AAAAAGGGGHHHHH!
          He bounces across the water's surface and takes a dive.
          Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless does the same,
          plunging in a massive cannonball.
          Hiccup resurfaces, roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears
          seconds later.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah!

          Now, a wet dragon head can't light
          its fire. The Hideous Zippleback is
          extra tricky. One head breathes
          gas, the other head lights it. Your
          job is to know which is which.

          The smoke encircles them, cutting them off from each other.
          The teens LISTEN and WATCH for any sign of the dragon.

                         FISHLEGS
          (muttering to himself)
          Razor sharp, serrated teeth that
          inject venom for pre-digestion.

          victims in its...

                         (TENSE)
          Will you please stop that?

          ON SNOTLOUT AND TUFFNUT
          Moving nervously through the fog, back to back. Snotlout is
          singing to himself to calm his nerves.

                         SNOTLOUT
          If that dragon shows either of his
          faces, I'm gonna--
          (spotting an approaching
          shape, terrified)
          --There!
          Snotlout and Tuffnut HURL their water into the fog.

                         ASTRID
          Hey!

                         RUFFNUT
          It's us, idiots.
          Astrid and Ruffnut are soaked.

                         TUFFNUT
          Your butts are getting bigger. We
          thought you were a dragon.

                         SNOTLOUT

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Not that there's anything wrong
          with a dragon-esque figure.
          Astrid ELBOWS Snotlout in the face. Ruffnut DROPS Tuffnut
          with a PUNCH to the throat.

                         ASTRID
          Wait.
          They FREEZE. A tail SWEEPS out of the fog, taking them down.
          Their buckets spill.

          ON FISHLEGS AND HICCUP coming across them. They see the
          puddles of spilled water.

                         TUFFNUT
          Oh, I'm hurt. I am very much hurt.

                         FISHLEGS
          Chances of survival are dwindling
          into single digits now...

                         HICCUP
          Look out!
          A Zippleback head emerges out of the smoke. Fishlegs hurls
          his water at it, completely dousing the head. It leers and
          opens its mouth, spewing gas into the area.

                         FISHLEGS
          Oh. Wrong head.
          GAS FLOWS around their legs. Fishlegs flees in a panic.

                         GOBBER
          Fishlegs!
          Beat. A clicking sound comes from behind them. Sparks flash
          in the smoke.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Now, Hiccup!
          The other head sweeps out of the smoke. Hiccup hurls his
          water with all his might. It arcs and drops short of the
          dragon's sparking mouth. The dragon grins, savoring the kill.

                         HICCUP
          Oh, come on!

                         GOBBER

          RUN, HICCUP!
          Gobber COVERS his eyes.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Hiccup!
          Beat.
          The Zippleback hesitates. SNIFFS. Then retreats.
          The teens get to their feet, watching transfixed. Gobber
          peeks through his fingers to see...

          The Zippleback backing away from Hiccup. He stands and holds
          his hands out, as if controlling it.

                         HICCUP
          BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don't you
          make me tell you again!
          The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave,
          hissing.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yes, that's right. Back into your
          cage.
          Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL
          from earlier. He TOSSES it inside the door, then SLAMS it
          shut.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Now think about what you've done.
          Hiccup turns to the teens and Gobber. They stare, slack-jawed

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay! So are we done? Because I've
          got some things I need to...
          Hiccup jogs out of the ring, past the speechless group.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yep...see you tomorrow.
          Astrid SNEERS. Something's going on.

          EXT. WOODS/COVE - SUNSET


          BEGIN MUSIC MONTAGE

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup cuts and stitches leather, draws and shapes steel. He
          works by candlelight. An overhead shot reveals what he's
          building: a harness, complete with handles and foot pedals.

          EXT. COVE - DAY

          Hiccup appears before Toothless, holding the new prosthetic.
          Toothless runs off as Hiccup chases him down.

                         HICCUP
          Hey!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 47.

          EXT. COVE - DAY

          Toothless and Hiccup are zooming over the ocean. The tail
          breaks free sending Hiccup flying.

                         HICCUP
          Yeah! Whoa!

          INT. BLAKCSMITH STALL - LATER

          Hiccup adjusts the harness and uses a metal clamp to affix
          himself to Toothless' saddle.

          EXT. SKY/FIELD - DAWN

          Hiccup and Toothless zip through the air -- his rudimentary
          harness and tail controls are working, barely. They crash-
          land in an open field.
          Hiccup recovers to find Toothless still rolling around in the
          tall grass. Hiccup discovers that it's a patch of âdragon-
          nip.' Toothless writhes on his back, tongue wagging, in
          complete bliss.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - MORNING

          Hiccup grabs the head as instructed, then discreetly pulls a
          fistful of âdragon-nip' and presses it up to the Gronkle's
          nose. It immediately stops struggling and goes weak in the
          knees. Hiccup drops the handful of dragon-nip to the ground.
          The Gronkle goes down with it, whimpering and blissful.
          From Gobber and the recruits' point of view, Hiccup is
          controlling the Gronkle with no more than a limp arm.

          EXT. WOODS - AFTERNOON

          The recruits walk home together, surrounding Hiccup and

          BOMBARDING HIM WITH QUESTIONS.

                         FISHLEGS
          Hey Hiccup, I've never seen a
          Gronkle to that before.

                         TUFFNUT
          How'd you do that?

                         RUFFNUT
          It was really cool.
          He squirms and invents an excuse.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 48.

                         HICCUP
          I left my axe back in the ring.
          He turns and hurries back.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You guys go on ahead and I'll catch
          up with you.
          Astrid watches, suspicious.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup rubs Toothless behind the ear, causing him to relax
          and fall over.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - LATER

          An angry Deadly Nadder approaches Hiccup. Just as Astrid
          moves in to strike, Hiccup performs his special rubbing
          technique, which sends the Nadder down. Astrid and the other
          kids look on from the sideline in amazement.

          INT. MEADE HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup sits down at a table to eat. The other recruits notice
          him and move over to his table to talk to him -- leaving
          Astrid alone.

                         FISHLEGS
          Hey Hiccup!

                         SNOTLOUT
          What was that? Some kind of trick?
          What did you do?

                         TUFFNUT
          Hiccup, you're totally going to
          come in first, there's no question.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup is using a mirror-like object to create a patch of
          light on the ground. Toothless claws and chases the light
          patch like a cat chasing a laser pointer.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          A beam lifts from the door of another dragon pen.

                         GOBBER
          Meet the Terrible Terror.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 49.
          A tiny, pint-sized dragon steps out and moves toward the
          recruits.

                         TUFFNUT
          Ha. It's like the size of my--
          Tuffnut is taken down in a blur.

          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)
          Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I'm
          hurt, I am very much hurt!
          Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same light-patch
          trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon
          retreats back to it's cage. The teens approach him yet again
          as Astrid looks on with suspicion.

          TUFFNUT (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Wow, he's better than you ever
          were.

                         CUT TO:

          EXT. FOREST - MOMENTS LATER

          Astrid furiously hurls her axe at a nearby tree. She notices
          Hiccup walking by in the distance, carrying one of his
          trademark harnesses. She quickly tries to follow, but he
          loses her in the woods.
          She HUFFS, frustrated.

          EXT. COVE - LATER

          Hiccup straps a newly designed harness onto Toothless. With
          Toothless tied to a nearby post with a rope. Hiccup rides him
          in the air -- while stationary. Toothless looks like a giant
          kite tied to a tree stump. This harness seems to work.

          EXT. SKY - MOMENTS LATER

          The rope breaks and the pair CRASH into a tree. Hiccup's face
          is red.

                         HICCUP
          Oh, great.

          EXT. BERK - NIGHT

          The streets are empty save for a lone Viking who crosses
          Hiccup's path.

          Hiccup.
          Hiccup nods, trying to look casual. Once the coast is clear,
          he covertly steers Toothless into the Blacksmith's stall.
          Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through stuff and
          making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.

          ASTRID (O.S.)
          Hiccup?
          Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically tries to pry the ring off
          the saddle hook. It won't budge.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Are you in there?
          Too late - she's right outside.
          ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith's.
          Hiccup JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind
          him. Hiccup's harness line is stretched through the window,
          still attached to Toothless' saddle.

                         HICCUP
          Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid.
          Hi Astrid.

                         ASTRID
          I normally don't care what people
          do, but you're acting weird. Well,
          weirder.
          Toothless spots a nearby sheep and makes a move toward it. As
          a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT against the window
          shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate... then gets PULLED
          THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid's face.
          Astrid reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall.
          In the distance, Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.

          EXT. DOCKS - DAWN

          A lone, battered ship is pulled into a slip, overloaded with
          equally battered-looking men. They disembark to a crowd of
          onlookers, looking like a team of hometown heroes who just
          had their butts kicked.
          Gobber hobbles through the MUMBLING crowd to find Stoick --
          last to disembark and glowering with battered pride.

          You don't want to know.
          Stoick lumbers past Gobber, leaving him staring at the
          trashed ship.

                         GOBBER
          Well, I trust you found the nest at
          least?

                         STOICK
          Not even close.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. Excellent.
          Gobber follows Stoick up the ramp and snags his duffle bag
          with his hook appendage, sharing the burden.

                         STOICK
          I hope you had a little more
          success than me.

                         GOBBER
          Well, if by success, you mean that
          your parenting troubles are over
          with, then... yes.
          Stoick stops. What does that mean?
          A group of merry villagers rush past.

                         VIKING #1
          Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is
          so relieved.

                         VIKING #2
          Out with the old and in with the

          Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns
          to Gobber.

          He's... gone?

                         GOBBER
          Yeah...most afternoons. But who can
          blame him? I mean the life of a
          celebrity is very rough. He can
          barely walk through the village
          without being swarmed by his new
          fans.
          Stoick is doubly confused.

          EXT. SKY - AFTERNOON

          Toothless and Hiccup soar through a perfect blue sky.
          Billowing clouds rise like mountains. The ground seems miles
          below them.

                         HICCUP
          Okay there bud, we're gonna take
          this nice and slow.
          Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his
          harness. Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and
          their pedal position equivalents.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Here we go. Here we go...position
          three, no four.
          He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll
          off into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon
          sun.
          Hiccup tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new
          harness and vest are holding. The foot controls make the tail
          appendage quick and responsive. He watches Toothless' every
          fluctuation, trying to match it with the prosthetic.
          Hiccup sizes up a target -- a towering arch of stone, rising
          from the sea.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Alright, it's go time. It's go
          time.
          They dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on. Come on buddy. Come on
          buddy!
          They zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah! Yes, it worked!
          The triumph is short-lived. They smack into one of several
          sea stacks as Hiccup tries to keep up with the turns.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Sorry.
          They hurtle into another rock pillar. Toothless grumbles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          My fault.
          Toothless swats him with his 'ear' plate.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.
          (referring to the cheat

                         SHEET)
          Position four, no three.
          They pierce the clouds. For the first time, Hiccup can see
          the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with every
          passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the
          handles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is
          amazing! The wind in my...
          He spots the leather guide tearing free in the turbulence.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)

          ... CHEAT SHEET! STOP!!
          Hiccup grabs frantically for the airborne sheet...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No!

          ... and NABS IT before it's carried out of reach. Toothless,
          however, obeys the command and suddenly STOPS beating his
          wings.
          As they slow to a stop, Hiccup goes weightless. The rings of
          his vest float off of the harness hooks. Hiccup suddenly
          finds himself detached, free-falling.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh gods! Oh no!
          Without Hiccup, the tail loses control. Hiccup and Toothless
          spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to get back under Hiccup.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (trying to calm Toothless)
          Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda
          angle yourself. No, no...come back
          down towards me. Come back down--
          Hiccup extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much
          surface area as he can. He angles back towards Toothless as
          the tumbling dragon WHACKS Hiccup with his wing.
          After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD of the
          harness and manages to lock in -- just in time to pull
          Toothless out of his dive... barely shy of the tree tops.
          They careen past the wooded cliff and directly into a
          treacherous slalom course of jutting sea stacks.
          Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to
          check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making
          it impossible.
          With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers
          Toothless' tail on instinct... with perfect intuition.
          Together, they manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split-
          second turns, making it to the open water, unscathed.
          Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the death-defying
          obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams, relieved.
          He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          YEEAHHH!
          Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and a fireball.
          Hiccup's glee turn to dread as they fly directly into it.

          ON HICCUP'S FACE

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Ah, come on.

          EXT. BLACK SAND BEACH - SUNSET

          Hiccup and Toothless lounge on a sprawling, deserted beach,
          snacking of freshly caught fish. As Hiccup cooks his over a
          fire, Toothless suddenly regurgitates a fish head. Hiccup
          smirks with forced politeness.

                         HICCUP
          Uh..no thanks.
          (gesturing to his fish on

                         A STICK)
          I'm good.
          Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing and
          nipping at each other as they approach Toothless' pile of
          fish.
          One grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away.
          Another attempts to steal it from him. They face off and last
          fire balls at each other to settle the fight. Hiccup and
          Toothless watch, amused. That is until...
          Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy
          Terrible Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the
          fish, and it snaps back into Toothless' mouth. He swallows it
          back tauntingly.
          Irate, the little dragon paws at the ground and blast
          Toothless. He opens his mouth, the gas hiss comes, and
          Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its mouth, causing
          the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up
          smoke and staggers away, looking ill.
          Hiccup laughs.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Not so fireproof on the inside, are
          you?
          Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Here you go.
          The appreciative little dragon gulps down the meal and
          approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next to him. Hiccup
          is amazed.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PENSIVE)
          Everything we know about you guys
          is wrong.

          Hiccup carefully pets him... sending the Terror into an
          immediate, blissful sleep.

          INT. BLACKSMITH STALL - HICCUP'S CLOSET - NIGHT

          HICCUP is lost in thought, his head laid of a desk full of
          Toothless drawings. Burdened with the weight of the world.
          Suddenly, STOICK appears in the doorway. Hiccup jumps and
          quickly covers up his desk.

                         HICCUP
          Dad! You're back!
          He skirts the bench, blocking Stoick's view of Toothless, the
          prosthetic fin, and other drawings.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Gobber's not here, so...
          He strikes an awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as
          much as possible.

                         STOICK
          I know. I came looking for you.

                         HICCUP

                         (CAUGHT)
          You did?

                         STOICK

                         (STERN)
          You've been keeping secrets.
          Hiccup's legs give out. He slides, dragging the table's
          contents with him.

                         HICCUP
          I...have?

                         STOICK
          Just how long did you think you
          could hide it from me?

                         HICCUP

                         (IN VAIN)
          I don't know what you're...

                         STOICK
          Nothing happens on this island
          without me hearing about it.

                         HICCUP
          Oh?

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 57.

                         STOICK
          So.

                         (BEAT)
          Let's talk about that dragon.
          Blood drains from Hiccup's face.

                         HICCUP
          Oh gods. Dad I'm so sorry. I was
          going to tell you. I just didn't
          know how to--
          Stoick starts laughing. Big, booming. Hiccup stares, baffled.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You're not...upset?

                         STOICK
          What?! I was hoping for this!

                         HICCUP
          Uh...you were?

                         STOICK
          And believe me, it only gets
          better! Just wait til you spill a
          Nadder's guts for the first time.
          Hiccup's elated expression sinks.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          And mount your first Gronckle head
          on a spear. What a feeling!
          Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder, sending him
          into the wall.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          You really had me going there, son.
          All those years of the worst Viking
          Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was
          rough. I almost gave up on you!
          Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of it all.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          And all the while, you were holding
          out on me! Thor almighty!
          Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame nearly fills
          the tiny room.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (RELIEVED)
          Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in
          the ring, we finally have something
          to talk about.
          Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes nervously. Stoick
          adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat.
          After a long, uncomfortable silence...

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Oh, I... brought you something.
          He presents a horned helmet.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          To keep you safe in the ring.

                         HICCUP

                         (SINCERE)
          Wow. Thanks.
          Hiccup accepts it, looking it over.

                         STOICK
          Your mother would've wanted you to
          have it.

                         (HEARTFELT)
          It's half of her breast plate.
          Stoick taps his own helmet and smiles.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Matching set. Keeps her close,
          y'know?
          Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Wear it proudly. You deserve it.
          You've held up your end of the
          deal.
          Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He forces a YAWN.

                         HICCUP
          I should really get to bed.

          (talking over each (talking over each

                         OTHER) OTHER)
          Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house.
          We should do this again. I'm Great. Thanks for stopping
          glad I stopped by, I hope you by. And for the... the uh,
          like the hat. breast hat.

                         STOICK
          Well..uh..good night.
          Stoick leaves the room awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more
          burdened than ever.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - AFTERNOON

          A Gronckle hovers above the ring, hunting victims as the teen
          recruits scramble.
          Astrid ducks behind a barrier to find Hiccup already there.
          She forces her axe at his throat.

                         ASTRID
          Stay out of my way! I'm winning
          this thing.

                         HICCUP
          Please, by all means.
          She darts off, CLOSING FAST on the dragon. The crowd above
          cheers her on.

          VIKING IN CROWD
          You got it Astrid!
          Hiccup stands and looks around. Amidst the crowd of
          onlookers, Stoick watches keenly, beaming with pride.
          He locks eyes with Hiccup, giving him a nod of encouragement.
          Hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half-hearted
          smile.
          Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee-
          line toward him.

          BACK TO ASTRID
          ... as she catches her breath behind a barrier. She scowls,
          focused, determined.

                         ASTRID
          This time. This time for sure.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 60.
          With a FIERCE BATTLE-CRY she LEAPS from cover, axe cocked to
          throw.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Aaaaaaaaaa...
          And as she clears the barriers, she sees that Hiccup has
          already laid the Gronckle out.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          ...aaaaaaauGGGGGHHHHHHHH! No! No!
          Hiccup shrugs, as unhappy with the situation as she is.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)

          NO! NO! SON OF HALFTROLL RAT EATING

          MUNGE BUCKET!
          A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd above, Gothi, the
          village elder, steps forward, tapping her staff. Everyone
          lights up excitedly.

                         STOICK
          Wait! Wait!

                         HICCUP
          So, later.
          Gobber snags Hiccup as he attempts to leave.

                         GOBBER
          Not so fast.

                         HICCUP
          I'm kinda late for--

                         ASTRID

                         (LIVID)
          What? Late for what exactly?
          Stoick holds out his hands to silence the jabbering crowd.

                         STOICK
          Okay quiet down. The elder has
          decided.
          Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points
          to Astrid as the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi
          shakes her head 'no.' The crowd 'Oooohs.'
          Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an affirmative
          'yes.' The crowd erupts in cheers.
          Astrid turns a seething, deadly glare on Hiccup.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 61.

                         GOBBER
          You've done it! You've done it,
          Hiccup! You get to kill the dragon!

                         STOICK
          Ha, ha! That's my boy!
          Hiccup is hoisted onto the recruits' shoulders and carried
          out to the cheering spectators...

                         HICCUP

                         (MASKING PANIC)
          Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can't
          wait. I am so...

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - DUSK


                         HICCUP
          ... leaving. We're leaving. Let's
          pack up. Looks like you and me are
          taking a little vacation, forever.
          Toothless is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket
          and opens it up, his head clouded with troubles.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh..man...
          SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound of...
          ASTRID, sitting on the rock right in front of him, sharpening
          her axe.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (SHOCKED)
          Aggh! What the--

                         (RECOMPOSING)
          What are you doing here?
          She hops off the rock and back him down, spinning her axe
          threateningly. Hiccup's eyes dart around nervously, searching
          for Toothless.

                         ASTRID
          I want to know what's going on. No
          one just gets as good as you do.
          Especially you. Start talking! Are
          you training with someone?

                         HICCUP
          Uh...training?
          She grabs him by his odd-looking harness.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 62.

                         ASTRID
          It better not involve... this.

                         HICCUP
          I know this looks really bad, but
          you see...this is, uh...
          They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the cove.
          Astrid DROPS Hiccup to the ground and sets off to
          investigate.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (PANICKED)
          You're right! You're right. I'm
          through with the lies. I've been
          making... outfits. So you got me.
          It's time everyone knew. Drag me
          back. Go ahead. Here we go.
          He puts her hand back on his harness, getting her to 'drag
          him back.' Astrid BENDS Hiccups hand backwards, driving him
          down.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do
          that?!

                         ASTRID
          That's for the lies.
          Astrid pounces the hilt of her axe off of Hiccup's laid-out
          body.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          And THAT'S for everything else.
          Hiccup's YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other
          side of the cove. Astrid looks up to see...
          A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them, snarling.

                         HICCUP

                         (FEEBLE)
          Oh man.
          She dives onto Hiccup.

                         ASTRID
          Get down! Run! Run!
          Astrid pulls her axe, ready to take on Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          No!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 63.
          Hiccup knocks Astrid's cocked axe to the ground, out of
          reach, then stops Toothless short of crushing her.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. It's okay! It's okay...
          Toothless pulls up short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with
          sand.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (CALMING)
          She's a friend.
          Toothless snorts in disagreement. Astrid is frozen. Toothless
          looks from her to Hiccup and back to her, confused.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          You just scared him.

                         ASTRID
          I scared him!?
          Hiccup makes a âbe quietâ motion.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)

                         (INTENSE WHISPER)
          Who is him?

          HICCUP.
          Astrid, Toothless. Toothless,
          Astrid.
          Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with
          pure disgust. She turns and RUNS for the village.

                         HICCUP
          We're dead.
          Satisfied with Astrid's departure, Toothless turns away.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          Where do you think you're going?

          EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

          ASTRID races through the trees. A large shadow overtakes her.
          She is suddenly SNATCHED into the air. Astrid SCREAMS.

                         ASTRID
          Oh great Odin's ghost, this is it!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 64.
          Hiccup and Toothless fly Astrid to the top of a towering
          pine. It bows and creaks under their weight as Astrid dangles
          a hundred feet in the air.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Hiccup! Get me down from here!

                         HICCUP
          You have to give me a chance to
          explain.

                         ASTRID
          I'm not listening to ANYTHING you
          have to say!

                         HICCUP
          Then I won't speak. Just let me
          show you.
          Hiccup extends a hand.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Please, Astrid.
          She eyes him and the dragon, then the ground far, far below.
          After a moment, she swats Hiccup's outstretched hand away and
          reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and harness. She
          settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as possible.

                         ASTRID
          Now get me down.

                         HICCUP
          Toothless? Down. Gently.
          Toothless leers mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly.
          With a WHOP, they fill with the updraft. Toothless releases
          the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS in place.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          See? Nothing to be afraid of.
          Toothless suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS.
          The acceleration is tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the
          saddle, heaving them into the sky, doubling their speed like
          a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She SCREAMS and hugs
          Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! What is wrong with you?!
          Bad dragon!
          (mortified; to Astrid)
          He's not usually like this. Oh
          no...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 65.
          Toothless ROLLS and PLUMMETS toward the coastline far below.
          Astrid SCREAMS.
          Toothless rockets over the ocean waves, deliberately dipping
          them in the froth.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless, what are you doing?!
          We need her to like us!
          Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over tail.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          And now the spinning. Thank you for
          nothing you useless reptile.
          Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.

                         ASTRID
          Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Just
          get me off of this thing.
          Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone. Satisfied,
          Toothless relents.
          They level off and head up into the clouds. Astrid opens her
          eyes again, and looks out over a world she'd never dreamed
          of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns
          ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky-
          scape. Her terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite
          herself.
          Toothless rises above a blanket of clouds...

                         DISSOLVE TO:

          EXT. SKY - NIGHT

          ...and levels off under a starry sky. They emerge from a
          blanket of clouds under the dancing Northern Lights,
          shimmering in ribbons across the vast sky.
          Below them, Berk's torches flicker in the inky darkness. The
          new perspective is breathtaking.
          Astrid tucks her arms into Hiccup's vest, burying her chin
          into his shoulder. The moment is not lost on either of them.
          Hiccup smiles nervously.
          Toothless climbs past Berk's tallest peaks and heads out over
          open water, leaving the village lights behind them.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 66.

                         ASTRID
          Alright I admit it. This is pretty
          cool. It's... amazing.

                         (BEAT)
          He's amazing.
          Astrid carefully reaches down and pats Toothless' side.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          So what now?
          Hiccup groans. It's a problem without an answer.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Hiccup, your final exam is
          tomorrow. You know you're going to
          have to kill...

                         (WHISPERED)
          ... kill a dragon.

                         HICCUP
          Don't remind me.
          A strange, unearthly din approaches. Toothless' ear plates
          suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he abruptly dives, dipping
          into cloud cover.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! What's happening? What
          is it?
          Toothless BARKS at him. 'Quiet!'
          Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a Monstrous Nightmare
          emerges.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Get down!
          Hiccup and Astrid duck. The Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback
          appears to the other side of Toothless, boxing him in.

                         ASTRID
          What's going on?

                         HICCUP
          I don't know.

                         (BEAT)
          Toothless. You've got to get us out
          of here, bud.
          Toothless HISSES.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 67.
          Other dragons, previously invisible in the thick clouds,
          appear all around them. HUNDREDS of them, all carrying fish
          and game in their talons.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (WHISPERED)
          It looks like they're hauling in
          their kill.
          The Zippleback eyes them ravenously.

                         ASTRID
          What does that make us?
          The dragons BANK and dive in formation, plummeting through
          the thickening fog and weaving between towering, craggy sea
          stacks.
          They emerge at the base of a massive volcanic caldera,
          glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of dragons fall into
          rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a
          winding tunnel.
          It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered with
          pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in
          hordes.
          The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into
          a central pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist.
          Hiccup is amazed.

                         HICCUP
          What my dad wouldn't give to find
          this.
          Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small
          shadowy shelf to keep a low-profile.
          Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in the busy hive of
          sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped into
          the pit.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          It's satisfying to know that all of
          our food has been dumped down a
          hole.

                         ASTRID
          They're not eating any of it.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 68.
          Last to arrive is a dim-witted Gronckle. It hovers over the
          pit and regurgitates his paltry contribution -- a pathetic
          little fish. As it falls into the steamy pit, a terrible ROAR
          rings out.
          The Gronckle tries to flee, but before it can, a gargantuan
          dragon head juts from the steamy pit and SNAPS it out of the
          air. Swallowing it back whole.
          Hiccup and Astrid recoil, terrified.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          What is that?
          The monstrous beast SNIFFS the air, seemingly aware of them.
          It nears the ledge where Toothless is hiding... and ROARS.
          Several dragons take flight in fear.

                         HICCUP
          Alright buddy, we gotta get out of
          here. Now!
          Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster's snapping
          jaws.
          The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback
          out of the air instead.
          Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
          dragons flee the caldera in fear.

          EXT. HIDDEN COVE - NIGHT - LATER

          Toothless glides into the cove and touches down on the
          moonlit beach.

                         ASTRID
          (her mind reeling, talking
          Hiccup's ear off)
          No, no, it totally makes sense.
          It's like a giant beehive. They're
          the workers... and that's their
          queen. It controls them.
          She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Let's find your dad.

                         HICCUP
          No, no! Not yet. They'll... kill
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Astrid, we have to think this
          through carefully.
          Astrid eyes him, incredulous.

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup, we just discovered the
          dragons' nest...the thing we've
          been after since Vikings first
          sailed here. And you want to keep
          it a secret? To protect your pet
          dragon? Are you serious?
          Hiccup stands firm, resolute.

                         HICCUP
          Yes.
          Astrid's taken aback.

                         ASTRID
          Okay.

                         (BEAT)
          Then what do we do?

                         HICCUP
          Just give me until tomorrow. I'll
          figure something out.

                         ASTRID
          Okay.
          Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          That's for kidnapping me.
          Hiccup looks to Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS,
          dismissive.
          Astrid grabs him. He braces for another hit. She KISSES
          Hiccup on the cheek.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          That's for, everything else.
          In the awkward wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off...
          leaving Hiccup RUBBING his cheek, stunned.
          Toothless hobbles up, eyeing him.

                         HICCUP
          What are you looking at?

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          The grounds have been transformed. Banners and flags flap in
          the morning sun. Surrounding the ring, a festive crowd had
          gathered. All of Berk has turned out for the event.

                         STOICK
          (aloud to the crowd)
          Well, I can show my face in public
          again.

          LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (PLAYFUL)
          If someone had told me that in a
          few short weeks, Hiccup would go
          from being, well... Hiccup, to
          placing first in dragon training...
          I would've tied him to a mast and
          shipped him off for fear he'd gone
          mad. Yes! And you know it!

                         (BEAT)
          But here we are. And no one's more
          surprised...
          ON HICCUP standing at the entrance to the ring, listening,
          looking burdened.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          ... or more proud than I am. Today,
          my boy becomes a Viking. TODAY, HE

          BECOMES ONE OF US!
          CHEERS and ROARS.
          Astrid approaches Hiccup.

                         ASTRID
          Be careful with that dragon.

                         HICCUP
          (re: the roaring crowd)
          It's not the dragon I'm worried
          about.

                         ASTRID

                         (WORRIED)
          What are you going to do?

                         HICCUP
          Put an end to this.
          She eyes him, dubious.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 71.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I have to try.

                         (BEAT)
          Astrid. If something goes wrong...
          just make sure they don't find
          Toothless.

                         ASTRID

                         (GRIM)
          I will. Just promise me it won't go
          wrong.
          Hiccup can't. Gobber approaches.

                         GOBBER
          It's time, Hiccup. Knock him dead.
          Hiccup puts his helmet on and enters the ring.

          ON THE TEENS
          HOOTING and HOLLERING from the stands.

                         TUFFNUT
          Show 'em how it's done, my man!
          Hiccup locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile.
          Hiccup returns a half-smile. Takes a deep breath.
          He hoists a shield onto his forearm and selects his weapon
          from a rack of many -- a small dagger.

                         STOICK

                         (MUTTERED)
          Hrmph. I would've gone for the
          hammer.
          Hiccup turns to face a bolted, heavy door. Takes a deep
          breath.

                         HICCUP
          I'm ready.
          The door bolt is raised. The crowd grows quiet...
          Beat.
          BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of sticky fire.
          Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It tears
          out of its cave like an irate bull -- as the crowd roars and
          jeers.
          It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing
          at the provoking crowd and blasting fire.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 72.
          It spots Hiccup and descends, leering and licking the flaming
          drool from its lips.
          The crowd grows silent, bracing for the big fight.
          With the Monstrous Nightmare's eyes locked upon him, Hiccup
          deliberately drops his shield and dagger stepping away from
          them. The dragon pauses, confused.
          ON STOICK, also confused.

                         STOICK
          What is he doing?
          The dragon presses closer, snorting. Hiccup extends his open
          hand. It snarls.

                         HICCUP

                         (WHISPERED)
          It's okay. It's okay.
          The dragon continues to pace, focused on... HICCUP'S HELMET.
          Hiccup realizes, then reaches up and removes it. Taking a
          breath to acknowledge the point of no return, he tosses the
          helmet aside. It hits the ground.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm not one of them.
          GASPS and MURMURS race through the crowd.
          ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He's welling with upset.
          Hiccup avoids Stoick's glare and remains focused on the
          Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming
          down.

                         STOICK
          Stop the fight.

                         HICCUP
          No. I need you all to see this.
          The crowd gets restless.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          They're not what we think they are.
          We don't have to kill them.

                         STOICK

          I SAID STOP THE FIGHT!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 73.
          Stoick whacks his hammer against the iron enclosure, rattling
          the arena with a terrible reverberating clatter.
          Spooked, the Nightmare snaps at Hiccup's outstretched hand.
          Hiccup YELPS and springs backward.
          The spell is broken. The Nightmare reacts to Hiccup's sudden
          movements and blasts another stream of fire. Hiccup SCREAMS
          and barely dives out of reach.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS


                         ON TOOTHLESS
          His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares in his eyes.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          Hiccup scrambles around the ring. The Nightmare pursues,
          snapping and springing from ground to wall.
          Stoick pushes through the crowd, rushing to the doorway.

                         STOICK
          Out of my way!

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup!
          Astrid wedges her axe under the arena gate and squeezes
          through.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

          Toothless bounds to the cove walls, clawing them in
          desperation. It seems he's as trapped as before, but with an
          incredible BURST of effort he HOOKS a claw over the upper lip
          of the stone wall.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          A narrow stream of fire narrowly avoids Hiccup as he
          continues to dash around the ring, evading the Monstrous
          Nightmare. Desperate, he goes to the weapon rack in an
          attempt to arm himself, but the Nightmare quickly destroys
          the rack and closes in on him.

          EXT. COVE - CONTINUOUS

          Toothless tears through the woods, bounding like panther and
          taking to the air in short bursts.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 74.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS

          Stoick wrenches the grated door to the arena and jumps
          through. The Monstrous Nightmare is only a few feet behind
          Hiccup. Astrid is now in the ring.

                         ASTRID
          Hiccup!
          She picks up a hammer and hurls it at the Monstrous
          Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its attention to
          Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena gate,
          waving her toward it.

                         STOICK
          This way!
          Astrid makes it through, but the Nightmare BLASTS the
          doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and prepares
          to finish him off.
          Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the din.

                         GOBBER
          Night Fury! Get down!
          Toothless bounds over the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the
          chain enclosure. He flies through it and disappears in the
          boiling smoke.
          The Vikings rush to railings... in time to see a flurry of
          wings cutting through the dissipating smoke. Toothless and
          the Nightmare tumble into the clear, locked in a toothy,
          vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and plants
          himself between Hiccup and it.
          The Nightmare snarls, circling them. Toothless lunges and
          ROARS... causing the Nightmare to relent and back away.
          To everyone's shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and
          grabs Toothless protectively.

                         HICCUP

                         (PANICKED)
          Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of
          here!
          The crowd is gob-smacked, growing livid.

                         VIKINGS
          Night Fury!

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 75.
          Hiccup tries to shoo Toothless away in vain. Vikings begin
          pouring clambering through the enclosure and dropping into
          the ring.

                         HICCUP
          Go! GO!

                         VIKING
          Take it alive!
          Stoick grabs an axe and charges into the arena. Astrid calls
          out to him, panicked.

                         ASTRID
          Stoick no!

                         HICCUP
          Dad! No! He won't hurt you!
          The other Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses
          them aside like rag dolls, his eyes focused on Stoick.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No, don't! You're only making it
          worse!
          Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless.
          Toothless ducks and pounces on him. They tumble end over end.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless! STOP!
          He pins Stoick and inhales. The familiar hiss of gas builds.
          Everyone braces...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          NO!
          Toothless swallows back the blast and turns to Hiccup, not
          understanding.

                         VIKING
          Get him!
          The crowd rushes him, piling on, and taking Toothless down.
          Astrid holds Hiccup back.

                         HICCUP

                         (DESPERATE)
          No! Please...just don't hurt him.
          Please don't hurt him.

          Stoick gets to his feet, fuming, shaken. A Viking presents
          Stoick with an axe. He eyes Toothless a moment, then pushes
          the axe back into the Viking's hands.

                         STOICK
          Put it with the others!
          His burning glare turn to Hiccup.

          INT. GREAT HALL - DAY


                         ON HICCUP
          Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall.
          SLAM! The massive doors rattle and echo. Stoick pushes past
          him. He paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and
          carved pillars -- a legacy of heroes, all peering down in
          angered judgement.

                         STOICK
          I should have known. I should have
          seen the signs.

                         HICCUP
          Dad.

                         STOICK
          We had a deal!
          Stoick pauses to say something, but stops short. He SNORTS
          and resumes pacing, repeating the cycle.

                         HICCUP

                         (FLUSTERED)
          I know we did... but that was
          before... ughh, it's all so messed
          up.

                         STOICK
          So everything in the ring. A
          trick? A lie?
          He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting
          back words.

                         HICCUP
          I screwed up. I should have told
          you before now. Take this out on
          me, be mad at me, but please...
          just don't hurt Toothless.

                         STOICK
          The dragon? That's what you're
          worried about? Not the people you
          almost killed?!

                         HICCUP
          He was just protecting me! He's not
          dangerous.

                         STOICK
          They've killed HUNDREDS OF US!

                         HICCUP
          And we've killed THOUSANDS OF THEM!
          They defend themselves, that's all!
          They raid us because they have to!
          If they don't bring enough food
          back, they'll be eaten themselves.

                         (BEAT)
          There's something else on their
          island dad...it's a dragon like--
          Stoick HUFFS.

                         STOICK
          --Their island?
          He stomps back... pointing an accusing finger.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          So you've been to the nest.

                         HICCUP
          Did I say nest?
          Hiccup goes silent -- he said too much.

                         STOICK
          How did you find it?!

                         HICCUP
          No... I didn't. Toothless did.
          Only a dragon can find the island.
          Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes form on
          his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick
          stomps toward the doorway.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Oh no. No, Dad. No.
          Hiccup chases after him, panicked.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 78.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Dad. It's not what you think. You
          don't know what you're up against.
          It's like nothing you've ever seen.
          He grabs Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He
          has no effect whatsoever.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Dad. Please. I promise you that you
          can't win this one.
          Nothing.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. Dad. No. For once in your life,

          WOULD YOU PLEASE JUST LISTEN TO

          ME?!
          He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to the floor.
          Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned.

                         STOICK
          You've thrown your lot in with
          them. You're not a Viking.

                         (BEAT)
          You're not my son.
          Stoick pushes through the door, leaving Hiccup alone,
          devastated.

                         (CALLING OUT)
          Ready the ships!

          EXT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS

          Stoick staggers on the steps, breaking inside.

          EXT. DOCKS/OPEN SEA - DAY

          Broken-down catapults and trebuchets are bundled up and
          lowered from the cliffs.
          Below on the docks, Vikings load the heavy artillery into the
          hulls of awaiting ships. Children and the elderly gather to
          on the walkways to wave apprehensive farewells to the
          departing warriors.
          Lastly, Toothless is loaded aboard Stoick's ship, chained
          down to a palette, muzzled, and restrained with a weighty
          neck ring. He looks exhausted, miserable.

          Stoick crosses to the bow as the ship pushes off and joins
          the amassed armada of ships adrift in the harbor.
          Stoick's brow is furrowed, all warmth drained away. He turns
          west and glares at the horizon with cold determination.

                         STOICK
          Set sail! We head for Helheim's
          Gate.
          He then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side
          perch beyond the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and
          regret. Hiccup slowly shakes his head in warning. Stoick
          breaks the stare and turns to Toothless, fuming.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Lead us home, Devil.

                         ON HICCUP
          Watching. He's powerless to stop what is happening, but won't
          leave.

          Still standing there. The ships have cleared the horizon.
          CRANE UP to reveal Astrid is standing behind him. She
          approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence.

                         ASTRID
          It's a mess.
          Hiccup doesn't respond.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          You must feel horrible. You've lost
          everything. Your father, your
          tribe, your best friend.

                         HICCUP
          Thank you for summing that up.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Why couldn't I have killed that
          dragon when I found him in the
          woods. It would have been better
          for everyone.

          Yep. The rest of us would have done
          it.

                         (BEAT)
          So why didn't you?
          Hiccup just shakes his head - he really doesn't know.
          Astrid's eyes glimmer. She wants something.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Why didn't you?

                         HICCUP
          I don't know. I couldn't.

                         ASTRID
          That's not an answer.

          of a sudden?

                         ASTRID
          Because I want to remember what you
          say right now.

                         HICCUP
          (angry, loud)
          Oh for the love of -- I was a
          coward! I was weak. I wouldn't kill
          a dragon.

                         ASTRID
          You said 'wouldn't' that time.

                         (BLOWS UP)
          Whatever! I wouldn't! Three hundred
          years and I'm the first Viking who
          wouldn't kill a dragon!

          A BEAT.

                         ASTRID
          First to ride one, though.
          Hiccup blinks. He never looked at it that way before.

                         (REALIZING)
          ...I wouldn't kill him because he
          looked as frightened as I was.

                         (BEAT)
          I looked at him and I saw myself.
          Astrid turns to face the open sea.

                         ASTRID
          I bet he's really frightened now.

                         (PROVOKING)
          What are you going to do about it?
          Beat.

          Probably something stupid.

                         ASTRID
          Good. But you've already done that.
          Another beat.

                         HICCUP
          Then something crazy.
          Astrid smiles.

                         ASTRID
          That's more like it.

          EXT. OPEN SEA/DRAGON ISLAND - DAY

          The armada coasts toward a shroud of heavy fog, hung like
          drapes from a low-hanging, ominous sky.
          The ships enter, one by one. Visibility drops immediately.
          Flanking ships becomes ghosts. The armada disappears, drawn
          into the blinding mist. Complete whiteout. Nothing remains
          but the eerie creaking of wood on water.
          ON STOICK at the bow of his ship. He taps his fingers on the
          gunwale, then looks back at Toothless impatiently. Weighed
          down with chains, Toothless seems unresponsive.

                         STOICK
          Sound your positions. Stay within
          earshot.
          Shouts pour in from all directions.

                         VIKING #1
          Here.

          On your starboard flank.

                         VIKING #4
          Three widths to port.

                         VIKING #5
          Ahead, at your bow.

                         VIKING #6
          Haven't a clue.
          ON STOICK straining into the fog as the calls continue.
          Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to emerge, threatening to
          rip the ships to shreds.
          Gobber approaches him, speaking under his breath.

                         GOBBER
          Listen... Stoick... I was
          overhearing some of the men just
          now and, well, some of them are
          wondering what it is we're up to
          here -- not me of course, I know
          you're always the man with the plan
          -- but some, not me, are wondering
          if there is in fact a plan at all,
          what it might be?

                         STOICK
          Find the nest and take it.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. Of course. Send them running.
          The old Viking fall-back. Nice and
          simple.

                         STOICK
          Shhh.
          Stoick notices that Toothless' ear plates are at the alert,
          quietly reacting to inaudible sounds.
          Stoick crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller,
          moving the helmsman out of the way.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Step aside.
          Stoick pulls the ship into a turn, covertly following
          Toothless' head movements.

          The ship barely misses a jagged outcrop that suddenly appears
          out of the soupy fog.

                         VIKING
          Bear to port.
          The order is called out from ship to ship.
          CRUNCH! The bow barely makes it past another sea stack.
          Stoick continues to follow Toothless' cues, undeterred.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - DAY

          Hiccup raises the bolt on the Monstrous Nightmare's pen.

          FISHLEGS (O.S.)
          If you're planning on getting
          eaten, I'd definitely go with the
          Gronckle.
          Hiccup turns to see his fellow recruits, watching him with
          folded arms. Tuffnut steps forward with a scowl.

                         TUFFNUT
          You were wise to seek help from the
          world's most deadly weapon.

                         (BEAT)
          It's me.

          Uh...

                         SNOTLOUT
          I love this plan.

                         HICCUP
          I didn't...

                         RUFFNUT
          You're crazy.

                         (SULTRY)
          I like that.

                         ASTRID
          So? What is the plan?
          Hiccup smiles, glowing in the support of his friends.

          EXT. FOGGY SEA - DAY

          The ships follow in line through the gauntlet of rocks as
          orders are whispered from ship to ship.

          A dragon head looms out of the fog. The men recoil... only to
          discover that it's a wrecked ship, impaled high on a gnarled
          sea stack.

                         GOBBER
          Ah. I was wondering where that
          went.
          A clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the
          sky, converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the
          air.

                         STOICK
          Stay low and ready your weapons.
          Stoick's ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows
          into shallow black sand.
          Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The
          BUZZING suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers
          into the gloom.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          We're here.
          Behind him, several dragon-headed bows pierce the fog.

          EXT. TRAINING GROUNDS - RING - DAY

          Hiccup steps back from the door, drawing the Monstrous
          Nightmare out of its cave. It snorts, stepping into the ring,
          calmed by Hiccup's outstretched hand -- focused on him.
          ON THE TEENS... bewildered, in awe.
          Snotlout nervously reaches for a spear laying near his foot.
          Astrid stops him.

                         ASTRID

                         (CORRECTING)
          Uh-uh.
          Hiccup slows to a stop in front of the teens, with the
          Nightmare inches from his outstretched hand.
          He reaches over and grabs Snotlout's trembling hand.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Wait! What are you...

                         HICCUP
          Relax. It's okay... it's okay.

          Hiccup replaces his outstretched hand with Snotlout's,
          putting him in control of the massive beast. The Nightmare
          snorts, but remains calm. Snotlout, by contrast, chuckles
          nervously -- it's at once terrifying and amazing.
          The others watch, spellbound.
          Hiccup turns and walks away.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Where are you going?!
          Hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box.

                         HICCUP
          You're going to need something to
          help you hold on.
          The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to
          reveal...
          ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens
          expectantly.

                         CLOSE ON
          Tree trunks, being sharpened and planted into the sand at
          angled rows.
          Boulders being loaded into catapult baskets.
          And a war plan being scratched in the sand.
          STOICK looms over it, looking determined. His generals are
          at his sides.

                         STOICK
          When we crack this mountain open,
          all hell is going to break loose.

                         GOBBER
          In my undies. Good thing I brought
          extras.
          Stoick TURNS to face the men.

                         STOICK
          No matter how this ends, it ends
          today.
          He walks toward the base of the volcano wall, back by several
          hundred warriors. He raises his arm and drops it.

          A line of catapults UNLEASH their two-ton loads into the
          cliff wall. It cracks and flakes away.
          Several more hits tear away at the hollow shell of hardened
          lava.
          A final boulder shatters the fractured wall, creating a deep,
          dark opening to the cavern within.
          Silence. Stock raises his hand, makes a gesture. A flaming
          bushel is launched into the dark, lighting the wall... CHOKED

          WITH DRAGONS.
          Stoick pulls his hammer and rushes into the cave, brazen.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          (War cries and slashing efforts)
          In a chaotic flurry, the dragons suddenly rush out like bats
          from a cave. The take to the air, bypassing the axe-swinging
          Vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus.
          The battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused.

                         GOBBER
          Is that it?
          Above the island, dragons POUR from every crevice, fleeing to
          the sky. The sound of screeching dragons fades.

                         VIKINGS
          (Cheering as one)

                         SPITELOUT
          We've done it!
          Stoick doesn't celebrate. Something is not right. He HEARS
          something. Stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the
          cavern.
          A deep, rumbling ROAR echoes from the cavern. The ground
          underfoot TREMBLES. The ships rock. Their sails fill with a
          blast of air.
          The cheering stops. Stoick's expression sinks.

                         STOICK
          This isn't over. Form your ranks!
          Hold together!
          The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Get clear!

          The ground CRACKS. Stone tears away, cascading like an
          avalanche. And through the settling debris, the silhouette of
          a gargantuan dragon emerges -- THE RED DEATH. Stirred and
          furious.

                         GOBBER
          Beard of Thor...what is that?

                         STOICK

                         (AGHAST)
          Odin help us.

                         (BEAT)
          Catapults!
          The Vikings score direct hits. The burning stones BOUNCE off
          the dragon's skin. The Red Death focuses on the catapults.
          It crushes the first one - smashing it and its crew, rattling
          the beach underfoot.
          Stoick races toward the second catapult. He LEAPS and pushes
          a Viking out of the way just before the dragon crushes him
          under his forepaw.
          The Vikings scramble in all directions.

                         VIKING #3
          Get to the ships!

                         STOICK
          No! NO!
          The Red Death BLASTS the ships like a mile-long flamethrower.
          The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard and masts come
          down.
          Gobber Joins Stoick.

                         GOBBER
          Heh. Smart, that one.
          Stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer.

                         STOICK

                         (GUILT-RIDDEN)
          I was a fool.
          The monster raises its head to the sky and BELLOWS. The
          sound SHAKES the beach, knocking Vikings off their feet.
          This island is his.
          Stoick stops a Viking General.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Lead the men to the far side of the
          island.

                         SPITELOUT
          Right.
          (turns to the others)
          Everybody to the far side of the
          island!
          The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with
          the ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back
          to the Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the
          air, searching for their scent.
          Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a trench.
          Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck.

                         STOICK
          Gobber, go with the men.

                         GOBBER
          I think I'll stay, just in case
          you're thinking of doing something
          crazy.
          Stoick grabs him.

                         STOICK

                         (EMPHATIC)
          I can buy them a few minutes if I
          give that thing someone to hunt.
          Gobber removes Stoick's hand. Clenches his forearm,
          determined.

                         GOBBER
          Then I can double that time.
          Stoick grins. Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and
          dash into the open, SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened
          post from the ground and hurls it into the monster's face.

                         STOICK

          HERE!

                         GOBBER

          NO, HERE!
          It spots both of them. He fuels up to fire, glancing back and
          forth between the two men. He focuses on Stoick.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          Come on! Fight me!

                         STOICK
          No, me!
          The Red Death remains focused on Stoick - this is it. It
          rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass, when...
          KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death's
          head. It turns distracted, as...
          ... a Nadder punches through the flames, banking across the
          sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a
          Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding
          on their backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his
          waist.
          GOBBER AND STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe.

                         HICCUP
          Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move
          Fishlegs!
          The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake.
          Hiccup directs his squadron out of harm's way. They climb out
          of reach and circle each other.

                         TUFFNUT
          Look at us, we're on a dragon!
          We're on dragons, all of us!

                         HICCUP
          Up, let's move it!
          The dragons climb past the Red Death.

          ON THE GROUND
          Gobber hobbles over to Stoick.

                         GOBBER
          Every bit the boar-headed, stubborn
          Viking you ever were.
          Stoick is speechless.

          IN THE AIR
          The group circles over the dragon's head.

                         HICCUP
          Fishlegs, break it down.

                         FISHLEGS
          Okay. Heavily armored skull and
          tail made for bashing and crushing.

                         FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
          Steer clear of both. Small eyes,
          large nostrils. Relies on hearing
          and smell.

                         HICCUP
          Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind
          spot. Make some noise, keep it
          confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if
          it has a shot limit. Make it mad.

                         RUFFNUT
          That's my specialty.

                         TUFFNUT
          Since when? Everyone knows I'm
          more irritating. See.

                         (IRRITATING SOUNDS)

                         HICCUP

                         (EXASPERATED)
          Just do what I told you. I'll be
          back as soon as I can.

                         TUFFNUT
          Don't worry, we got it covered!

                         FISHLEGS
          Yeah!
          Hiccup and Astrid peel away. The teens bank and dive toward
          the monster, splitting up. The Twins race alongside the
          monster's head, taunting it.

                         TUFFNUT
          Troll!

                         RUFFNUT
          Butt Elf!

                         TUFFNUT
          Bride of Grendel!
          The Red Death unloads a spray of fire at the twins. They
          barely dodge it.
          Fishlegs and Snotlout hang behind its eyes, banging away at
          their shields, making a racket.
          The Red Death opens all SIX of its eyes, spotting them.

                         FISHLEGS
          Uh, this thing doesn't have a blind
          spot.

          ON HICCUP AND ASTRID
          ... searching for Toothless. Hiccup spots him among the
          burning ships.

                         HICCUP
          There!
          He steers the Nadder over the deck and hands Astrid the
          reins. He lines up his jump... and hops off, guarding his
          face from the flames. He lands on the burning deck.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (TO ASTRID)
          Go help the others!
          She and the Nadder take off.
          As Hiccup fights his way to Toothless. He unbuckles the
          muzzle. Toothless shrieks.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, hold on. Hold on.
          He gets to work on the chains.

          ON SNOTLOUT AND FISHLEGS
          They clang their weapons against their shields, making the
          monster wince.

                         SNOTLOUT
          It's working.
          The huge beast starts to sway its head dizzily.

                         FISHLEGS
          Yeah! It's working.
          PAN DOWN to reveal that the noise is also confusing the
          Gronckle and the Monstrous Nightmare. Both dragons lose their
          bearings.
          The Red Death thrashes, knocking Snotlout off of his dragon
          and onto the monster's gigantic head. Snotlout bounces across
          the top and comes to a stop just shy of the hundred foot
          drop.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Agghh!
          Fishlegs' Gronckle goes down in a spin of confusion.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 92.

                         FISHLEGS
          I've lost power on the Gronckle.
          Snotlout! Do something!
          He hurls Snotlout his hammer. The Gronkle crashes and skids
          to a stop...

          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)
          I'm okay!
          ... then flips over, crushing Fishlegs.

          FISHLEGS (CONT'D)

                         (FEEBLE)
          Less okay.

          BACK TO SNOTLOUT
          ... who eyes the Red Death's gigantic, veiny eyes. He raises
          the hammer...

                         SNOTLOUT
          I can't miss!
          ... and hammers the monster's eyes, playing whack-a-mole.

          SNOTLOUT (CONT'D)
          What's wrong buddy, got something
          in your eye?
          Astrid flies by on her Nadder, catching Snotlout in all his
          heroics.

                         ASTRID
          Yeah! You're the Viking!
          Snotlout grins, finally vindicated in her eyes. In his
          distraction, he gets thrown and lands heavily on one of the
          Red Death's spines -- clinging precariously. A close call.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Whoa!

          ON THE GROUND
          The monster's tail sweeps across the burning ships, snapping
          masts like twigs. We follow one down as it crashes onto a
          deck, revealing...

                         HICCUP
          Working at the chains. He can't budge them. Fire licks at his
          clothes. He looks up to see...

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 93.
          THE RED DEATH blasting at the teens, enraged.
          The monster's giant foot crashes through frame, smashing the
          bow under its impressive weight.
          Hiccup and Toothless are thrown into the water in a maelstrom
          of burning planks and rigging.

                         UNDERWATER
          Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They're both caught in a mess
          of rigging, being dragged down. The heavy palette settles
          into the rocky bottom like an anchor. Toothless has stopped
          struggling. Hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains -
          he's almost out of air.
          Suddenly, a meaty hand grabs Hiccup.
          STOICK explodes to the surface, pulling Hiccup to the
          shoreline through flaming debris. He lays him down, under the
          shelter of an overhanging rock.

                         HICCUP

                         (OVERWHELMED)
          Dad...
          Stoick dives back into the water between flaming flotsam.

                         UNDERWATER
          ON TOOTHLESS, drowning. Stoick appears in front of him.
          Toothless freezes. Stoick tears the chains off of the yoke
          and lets it float free.
          Momentary stillness. They eye each other, through the churned
          up bubbles. Toothless lunges out of the bars -- grabbing
          Stoick.
          BOOM! In an explosion of sea water, Toothless lands on the
          shore, setting Stoick down and releasing him. Hiccup is awed.
          The ground rumbles underfoot. The monster screeches. Its
          massive claws stomp around in the smoke.
          Stoick gives way as Toothless mounts the rock and raises his
          wings. He turns to Hiccup and SNORTS - âLet's go.'

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          You got it, bud.
          Hiccup climbs onto Toothless and buckles himself in.
          Stoick grabs his arm.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 94.

                         STOICK
          Hiccup. I'm sorry...for
          everything.

                         HICCUP
          Yeah...me too.

                         STOICK
          You don't have to go up there.

                         HICCUP
          We're Vikings. It's an occupational
          hazard.
          They exchange smiles.

                         STOICK
          I'm proud to call you my son.
          Hiccup beams, taken aback.

                         HICCUP
          Thanks dad.
          Stoick lets go of Hiccup's arm.
          Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father's belief
          in him. They rocket into the sky as Stoick watches.

          IN THE AIR
          Astrid sees Toothless streaking through the sky, gaining
          altitude.

                         ASTRID
          He's up!
          She turns to Ruffnut and Tuffnut, who are ARGUING and
          THROWING PUNCHES at each other.

          ASTRID (CONT'D)
          Get Snotlout out of there!
          IN MID-PUNCH, the twins look over to see Snotlout stranded on
          the monster's head. They eye each other.

                         TUFFNUT RUFFNUT
          I'm on it! I'm on it!

                         TUFFNUT
          I'm on it first! I'm ahead of you.
          The twins spot Snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their
          Zippleback in his direction.

                         RUFFNUT
          Hey! Let me drive!
          The twins peel off, ARGUING as they race each other to the
          monster.
          Snotlout sees the Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES
          down the Red Death's head. He runs up the end of its horn...
          As the twins sweep past, both missing him... but perfectly
          snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye each
          other, surprised and impressed.

                         TUFFNUT
          I can't believe that worked.
          The Red Death spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast.
          She and her Nadder get caught in the suction, pulled toward
          the monster's gaping mouth.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings watch with dread. They hear the familiar whir of
          the...

                         GOBBER
          Night Fury! Get down!

          IN THE AIR
          A massive BLAST jolts the Red Death's head sideways. Astrid
          is thrown clear of its mouth... AND her Nadder. She tumbles
          through the air. The ground races toward her, when...
          She's suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          Did you get her?
          Toothless grunts.

          ON THE GROUND
          They fly over the crowd of Vikings and set Astrid down, mid-
          run. They circle back to reengage - a black speck against the
          clouds.

                         ASTRID

                         (BREATHLESS)
          Go.

          IN THE AIR

          Hiccup and Toothless rocket past the Red Death's head and
          climb, higher and higher.

                         HICCUP

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          That thing has wings! Okay, let's
          see if it can use them!
          Hiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining
          tremendous speed. The wind buffets them as they target the
          Red Death as super sonic speed.
          KABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death's
          head. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings shield themselves from the dust of the fallen
          monster... as its wings unfold and extend.

          IN THE AIR
          Hiccup looks back as they put distance between them.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Do you think that did it?
          Suddenly, the enraged behemoth RISES into frame... flapping
          its wings furiously. A daunting sight.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Well, he can fly.
          Hiccup and Toothless DIVE into the tangled sea stacks - they
          weave through the rock like rabbits through a briar. The Red
          Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them. Hiccup and
          Toothless PULL AHEAD.
          The Red Death SMASHES through the canopy of rock and pulls in
          behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH fifty-foot formations
          like they were saplings.

          ON THE GROUND
          Stoick, Gobber, and the Teens watch as Hiccup and Toothless
          streak past, weaving through sea stacks.

                         TEENS
          Woohoo! Yeah!
          A moment later the Red Death SMASHES the sea stacks to dust
          in hot pursuit. The Vikings mood is quenched.

          IN THE AIR

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 97.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't slow the monster down. Hiccup eyes
          the clouds above. An idea hits him. He locks eyes with
          Toothless.

                         HICCUP
          Okay Toothless, time to disappear.
          Toothless PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the
          clouds.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on bud!
          The Red Death follows, closing in fast.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          (hearing the gas)
          Here it comes!
          BLAST! They narrowly dodge a column of flame and smoke. They
          reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce them. The monster
          follows, immediately losing them in the hampered visibility.
          It roars irritably.
          From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at the huge dragon,
          BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless and
          Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at
          them.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings stare up at the sky listening to the resounding
          BOOMS and watching FLASHES light up the clouds.
          Gobber places a hand on Stoick's shoulder.

          IN THE AIR
          HICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and again, using the
          clouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the monster's
          wings.
          It BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing fire
          blindly, in all directions.
          Hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting towards them.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Watch out!
          The random blast CLIPS Toothless' tail. It's heavily damaged.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 98.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, time's up. Let's see if this
          works.
          He pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the
          Red Death's face, taunting it.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Come on! Is that the best you can
          do!?
          Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a
          steep dive. The Red Death pursues.
          Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than he's ever gone
          before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red Death
          -- no longer trying to evade it.
          Hiccup glances back to check the tail - it's disintegrating.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Stay with me buddy. We're good.
          Just a little bit longer.
          The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and holds
          Toothless steady -- allowing the monster to set its sights on
          them. It narrows its eyes.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Hold, Toothless.
          The Red Death OPENS his mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates
          from his throat -- ignition is coming.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

          NOW!
          Hiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless extends one wing.
          They PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red Death's
          mouth.
          Toothless FIRES point blank down the monster's throat. Its
          amassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster,
          erupting in a chain of blasts throughout its body.
          Hiccup and Toothless BURST from the clouds, the Red Death hot
          on their tail, exploding from within. It glances forward and
          sees the ground rushing up. It throws open its wings,
          attempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged
          wings can't stop its momentum.
          As the Red Death chokes on the expanding fireball, he sees
          Toothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up, past
          its head.

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 99.
          The Red Death HITS the ground, head-first. It EXPLODES like
          the Hindenburg.
          Hiccup and Toothless weave through the monster's massive back
          plates, wings, and flailing legs -- a high-speed recall of
          the FREE FALL slalom run. The expanding fireball races toward
          them, about to swallow them.
          They manage to clear the obstacles. Hiccup glances back.
          They're outrunning the fireball.
          He looks forward just in time to see the monster's massive
          club tail careening toward them.
          He tries to shift their direction. The last shreds of
          Toothless' tail tear away. Hiccup's pedals go DEAD.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          No. No.
          Hiccup and Toothless can't maneuver - they're dead in the
          air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING Hiccup from
          the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of
          the fast-approaching fireball.
          Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to reach the
          unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.

          ON THE GROUND
          The Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup and Toothless disappear
          into the boiling inferno.

                         DISSOLVE TO:
          A whiteout of ash. And through it comes...

                         STOICK
          Hiccup? Hiccup!?
          Stoick appears, searching desperately. Everything is
          scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the terrible heat.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Hiccup!? Son!?
          Through the ash, Stoick the motionless silhouette of
          Toothless.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (GRAVE)
          Hiccup.

          He hurries to the dragon's side. Toothless is roughed up, but
          conscious. His scorched saddle, however, is vacant.
          Stoick looks to the sky in despair. He buckles at the knees,
          overwhelmed by the loss.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Oh son...I did this...
          Astrid pushes through the crowd, her eyes welling up.
          Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he kneels, slumped
          over.
          Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a respectful
          distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild
          dragons can also be seen, gathering just behind and between
          the Vikings.
          Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick.
          Their eyes meet.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          I'm so sorry...
          Toothless unfolds his wings, revealing Hiccup, unconscious,
          clutched safely against his chest. Stoick's eyes widen.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          Hiccup.
          He scoops Hiccup into his arms. Listens to his heart. Bursts
          into relieved laughter.

          STOICK (CONT'D)
          He's alive!

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          You brought him back alive!
          The crowd roars. Followed by the dragons. The Vikings look
          around to find themselves surrounded.
          Stoick leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye.

          STOICK (CONT'D)

                         (PRIVATELY)
          Thank you... for saving my son.
          Gobber looks Hiccup up and down.

                         GOBBER
          Well, you know... most of him.
          Stoick glances back at him. Gobber shrugs, redirecting his
          eyes toward...

          INT. STOICK'S HOUSE - DAY


                         CLOSE ON
          HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow. Healing scars on his
          face show that maybe a week or two have passed.
          Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently.
          Hiccup stirs. Opens his eyes.

                         HICCUP

                         (GROGGY)
          Oh, hey Toothless.
          Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges Hiccup.

                         HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay, okay! I'm happy to see you
          too, bud. Now just--
          Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
          UPRIGHT with a YELP.
          He looks around, confounded. He's in his bed, moved beside
          the fire pit on the main floor of his house.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          I'm in my house.
          (re: Toothless, leaning
          over him, excited)
          You're in my house.
          Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far
          too big for the space.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Uh...does my dad know you're in
          here?!
          Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He
          eyes the rafters... and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with
          'happy dog' energy.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)

                         (DISTRESSED)
          Okay, okay -- no Toothless! Aw,
          come on...
          Hiccup shifts to get out of bed... then pauses... sensing
          that something is wrong.
          He peels back the covers slowly. What he sees startles,
          horrifies, and overwhelms him -- all at once.

          ON THE BARE FLOOR
          His booted foot touches down. Followed by a mechanical
          prosthetic in place of his second leg. It's an ingenious
          spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron.
          Toothless lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing
          the new leg. He raises his eyes to meet Hiccup's, seemingly
          aware of what Hiccup is going through.
          Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on
          it. He winces and stifles the pain...

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Okay...okay...
          ... but STUMBLES with the first step. Toothless catches
          Hiccup's fall with his head... and slowly lifts him up,
          stabilizing him.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Thanks bud.
          Hiccup leans on him like a crutch. They take a few steps
          together.
          Their missing parts form a poetic silhouette as they make
          their way toward the door.
          Hiccup pries it open (as he did in the opening scene),
          revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
          Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to
          Toothless, alarmed.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Toothless? Stay here, bud.
          Hiccup pauses... and cracks the door open again. He peeks
          outside, his eyes widening. He allows to door to swing open,
          revealing...
          ... the Monstrous Nightmare, carrying Snotlout on its back.

                         SNOTLOUT
          Come on guys, get ready! Hold on
          tight! Here we go!
          A class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on a
          variety of dragons, pulling back the curtain on an amazing
          vista in which:

                         

                         

                         

                         
          "Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 103.
          Vikings and dragons mill about by the dozen, basking on the
          rooftops, weaving along the plaza. No one seems upset, there
          isn't a sword in sight.
          Under the framework of a MASSIVE BARN, a Nadder BLASTS fire
          onto a metal brace. It steps back to let a Viking hammer it
          into shape. Nearby, a Gronkle lands, carrying a tree trunk in
          his mouth. He shows a Viking what he's found. The Viking pats
          his head. Another Viking backs a Zippleback into a stall to
          check it for size.
          Hiccup takes a step outside, finding Stoick waiting for him
          on the step.

                         HICCUP
          I knew it. I'm dead.
          Stoick laughs.

                         STOICK
          No, but you gave it your best shot.
          He puts his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to
          the transformed village.

                         STOICK (CONT'D)
          So? What do you think?
          Hiccup just shrugs, amazed.
          Below, the plaza, villagers take notice.

                         VIKING #1
          Hey look! It's Hiccup!
          They rush over, surrounding him with a hero's welcome.

                         VIKING #2
          Hiccup, how you doin' mate?

                         VIKING #3
          It's great to see you up and about.

                         STOICK

                         (SWEETLY)
          Turns out all we needed was a

                         (PLAYING ALONG)

          GOBBER (O.S.)
          Well. Most of you.
          Gobber pushes through the crowd, beaming proudly.

          GOBBER (CONT'D)
          (re: the prosthetic leg)
          That bit's my handiwork. With a
          little Hiccup flare thrown in.
          Think it'll do?

          I might make a few tweaks.
          Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in the arm. Hiccup recoils
          with a grumble.

                         ASTRID
          That's for scaring me.

          What, is it always going to be this
          way? Cause I...
          She grabs him aggressively... then kisses him. Hoots and
          hollers follow.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          ... could get used to it.
          Gobber presents Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and
          tail.

                         GOBBER
          Welcome home.
          Suddenly, Toothless pounces on the crowd, crushing several
          unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.

                         VIKING
          Night Fury, get down!
          Toothless eyes the new tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst
          the groans and grumbles, Hiccup and Astrid exchange a
          sheepish grin.

          The two pieces click together, forming a single shape.
          Astride Toothless, he's whole again. He rotates the pedal.
          The new tail opens. Bright red with a skull and Viking horns
          emblazoned on it. Hiccup approves.

          CUT BACK TO REVEAL...
          Hiccup and Toothless, saddled up and ready to fly. Astrid
          backs her Nadder into position.

                         (TO TOOTHLESS)
          You ready?
          Toothless SNORTS an excited 'yes!'
          From his mount, Hiccup looks out over the changed world.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          This... is Berk.

                         (BEAT)
          It snows nine months of the year...
          and hails the other three.
          They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid
          follows, giving chase.

          HICCUP (CONT'D)
          Any food that grows here is tough
          and tasteless. The people that grow
          here are even more so.
          Hiccup and Astrid race their dragons through the village --
          under eaves, over rooftops, down cliff-sides, and between
          ship masts. It's a high energy, romantic dance of sorts.

          HICCUP (V.O.) (CONT'D)
          The only upsides are the pets.
          While other places have...ponies or
          parrots, we have...
          Their fellow recruits join them as they take to the open sky,
          rocketing far above the village. The Northern sky swirls with
          blazing, multicolored dragons.
          Hiccup and Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the
          blinding sun.

               BLACKNESS.

               There is a gunshot. A crow screams. A fluttering of wings.

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Bird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest.

               Through a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse 
               of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera 
               gets closer we see that the form is a human body.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I'm not sorry.

               A bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding 
               flash of light obliterates her face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               A tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another 
               blinding flash of light.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         anymore.

               As Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face 
               from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of 
               light.

               It's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police 
               car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash. 
               Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face 
               from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch 
               her shoulders.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               A ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls.

               Beat-up file cabinets. Dark. A bit of fluorescent light spills 
               in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at 
               the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs 
               in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking 
               cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of 
               the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she 
               brings the cigarette to her mouth.

                                     LILA
                         I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest 
                         of my life in jail. So what? I've 
                         been in jail my whole life anyway. A 
                         jail of blood and tissue and coursing 
                         hormones...

               One of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose.

               It's going to be a long night.

                                     LILA
                         ...a jail called the human body.

               The lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference 
               to "human body."

                                     LILA
                         My soul held prisoner in this reeking, 
                         stench-ridden bag of bones and 
                         entrails. A bag of feces and piss 
                         and fibroid cysts in my tits and 
                         precancerous moles on my sun-damaged 
                         back...

               The lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. Lila drags 
               on her cigarette, calmer now.

                         At least now I'll be able to blame 
                         the state, not God, for my 
                         incarceration.

               Puff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp 
               business suit, testifies before a congressional committee. 
               The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. Puff 
               sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours 
               himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then 
               speaks: stentorian, confident.

                                     PUFF
                         I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all 
                         of us. Your's is a complicated, sad 
                         world.

               This is a revelation to the assembled crowd. People whisper 
               to each other.

                                     PUFF
                         And I never knew that. I was living 
                         a life of simplicity, of purity, 
                         when I was ripped out of my Eden and 
                         immersed in this harshness. Some 
                         would argue that the life I was living 
                         was not a human life at all. And, 
                         gentlemen, I don't have any clever 
                         retort. I am not a philosopher. The 
                         only thing I know is that I am sorry, 
                         sorry for my expulsion from Eden, 
                         sorry for my Lila rotting in her 
                         jail cell, and sorry for Nathan... 
                         rotting in his grave.

               table. Everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound 
               in Nathan's temple.

                         I don't even know what sorry means 
                         anymore. It's odd. When I was alive 
                         I knew -- maybe it was all I knew -- 
                         but here sorry is meaningless. Love 
                         is meaningless. Jealousy is 
                         meaningless. Ambition is meaningless. 
                         Everything that motivated my every 
                         breath while I was alive is 
                         meaningless now.

               Other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing 
               and chatting. Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face.

                         Something terrible happened when I

               Colors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early 
               70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters 
               on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes 
               the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that 
               the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls 
               some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into 
               the space between the bottom of the door and the floor.

                         Drop dead, Eric.

               Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on 
               her closet door. She takes a deep breath and begins to 
               unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror.

                         Something terrible started to happen 
                         to my body when I was twelve. My 
                         mother said because of it I would 
                         never be able to get a man, so I 
                         should get used to the idea of 
                         dedicating my life to the pursuit of 
                         knowledge, or religion... or whatever.

               Lila's shirt is now unbuttoned. She pulls it open. She is 
               wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast 
               buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below 
               it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it 
               cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball 
               and weeps.

               Old fashioned office. Twelve year old Lila sits on the 
               examination table, her shirt off. An elderly male doctor 
               touches the hair, fingers it. Her mother looks on.

                         like an ape.

                         was raised in the wilderness by an 
                         ape. Well, to be fair, by a man who 
                         thought himself an ape, but it amounts 
                         to the same thing gentlemen, does it 
                         not?

               This has a faded, "memory" look also. A naked, bearded, dirty

                         My father escaped from a New Jersey 
                         mental institution in 1963.

               It's raining and deserted. Puff's father, in pajamas, comes 
               tearing around the corner. He runs crazily towards the camera, 
               waving his arms, puffing out his cheeks.

                                     PUFF (V.O.)
                         He had been committed the previous 
                         year after applying one too many 
                         times at our local zoo for the job 
                         of "apprentice ape."

               Puff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops, 
               goes back and examines the headline. It reads: President 
               Kennedy Assassinated. Puff's father looks heavenward and 
               clutches at his temples in despair.

                                     PUFF (V.O.)
                         My father saw what the human race 
                         had come to while he was... in 
                         captivity. He felt something had to 
                         be done to create a better world.

                         He stole little me from my mother, 
                         his ex-wife, and raised me, with 
                         love and tenderness and respect, as 
                         an ape like himself.

               The congressmen are shamed: they look down, they take notes, 
               they mumble instructions to the assistants seated behind 
               them.

                         Until quite recently I believed myself 
                         to be an ape, although I didn't know 
                         specifically what type. Apes don't 
                         think in terms of type.

                         It might be argued, gentlemen, that 
                         apes don't even know that they are 
                         apes. In retrospect, however, I'd 
                         say that I was a pygmy chimp.

                         I have to say I always hated apes. 
                         Of course I don't any longer. I don't 
                         even know what hate means now. But 
                         while alive, I hated apes. I blame 
                         my parents. I mean, I don't blame 
                         them. I don't know what blame is, 
                         really, anymore, but I think they 
                         influenced me in my ape-hating 
                         tendencies.

               They arrive at the ape pen. Nathan is excited. He jumps up 
               and down. The apes jump up and down also.

                         precise.

               There is a commotion off screen. Two uniformed attendants 
               drag Puff's father, straitjacketed and kicking and screaming 
               like an ape, past Nathan and his parents.

               Nathan, his father, and the other zoo patrons look on 
               curiously, a little frightened. Nathan's mother chooses to 
               ignore it.

               Twelve year old Lila walks sadly through an art museum. she 
               looks at various old portraits of men. She studies their 
               facial hair. When she turns a corner, she is shocked to see 
               a large Renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered 
               with fur. She hurries to it. She looks at the placard next 
               to the painting. It is a painting of Mary Magdalene.

                         I remember once coming across a 
                         painting of Mary Magdalene entirely 
                         covered with fur. I guess that's 
                         where I got the idea that maybe the 
                         Catholic Church might be a place 
                         that encouraged excessive hair growth 
                         in its women.

               Lila walks home. She's wrapped in winter clothing, but we 
               can still see a bit of her white beard. It's snowing. The 
               street is deserted. She spots a lighted window, she peers 
               in. It's a warm family scene. Large group of chatting, 
               laughing people. Fire in the fireplace. Big turkey on the 
               table.

               Lila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely-looking 
               people peering forlornly in warmly lit windows. Some on 
               ladders to peer in second-floor windows. Lila sighs.

               The room is lit with candles. Lila finishes shaving herself 
               all over. Then she takes the double-edged blade out of the 
               razor and climbs into the a bathtub filled with warm water.

               She is about to slice her wrists.

                         I decided there was something poetic 
                         about killing myself with a razor 
                         blade.

               On the shelf next to the tub a little gray mouse watches her 
               intently. At first she is startled, but then she and the 
               creature seem to be communing. His little black beady eyes 
               reflect the light. Lila starts to cry. She puts down the 
               blade.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         The way that mouse looked at me. 
                         There was no judgement. It didn't 
                         care if I had hair all over my body. 
                         I was just what I was. I felt so 
                         free. Do you understand what I'm 
                         saying?

               rustling inside the tent. Lila steps out naked. She is covered 
               with fur. She pours a cup of coffee, and stands, comfortable 
               in her skin, watching the world around her.

               Squirrels jump from tree to tree, birds look down at her.

               She smiles.

                         Birds and squirrels and rocks and

                         I felt at peace when there were no 
                         humans around. I figured out a way 
                         to spend as much time as possible 
                         with no people around. I became a 
                         nature writer.

               Lila picks up a pad and pen from a rock, sits on the rock 
               and writes.

               turned into the explosive noise of rain beating down in sheets 
               and wind howling at fifty miles an hour. Branches crack. 
               Lila's tent blows over, revealing her huddled there with a 
               sleeping bag wrapped around her like a blanket.

                         I knew it was coming when in late 
                         afternoon, a thunderhead drifted 
                         over, sneaking in like kids through 
                         the back door of a movie theater, 
                         forced casual. It turned the sky a 
                         queer shade of green. A green that 
                         said "watch out, baby, this is gonna 
                         hurt like hell." I could've 
                         hightailed, but that would be 
                         cheating. Part of the Nature

                         over you, your smallness in the face 
                         of it.

               Lightning hits a tree nearby. It falls with a smack 
               practically on top of Lila. She screams, then defiantly 
               stands, throwing off the sleeping bag. The wind and rain 
               whip her hair around her head. She laughs with amazing gusto 
               and raise her arms like a runner winning a marathon.

               Lila lies shirtless on a table while Rose, her fifty year 
               old electrologist, works on her back.

                                     ROSE
                         Progress!

                         Ouch. Yeah?

                         Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth 
                         smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a

                         I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a 
                         real girl.

                              (beat)
                         Cause there's this guy. My brother 
                         knows him. Might be right up your 
                         alley.

                         Tell me. I could use someone up my

                                     ROSE
                         Somehow it came up that you were a 
                         friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal-
                         loving psychologist said he would 
                         love to meet you.

                                     LILA
                         Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell 
                         him about the nature of our 
                         relationship, did he?

                                     ROSE
                         My brother is discreet.

                              over her jaw)
                         Won't he be able to tell?

                                     ROSE
                         My brother says the guy's a thirty-
                         five year old virgin, so maybe he 
                         won't know how women usually feel. 
                         Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost 
                         legally blind, which is helpful in 
                         this situation. Plus he's got an 
                         extremely small penis, of which he 
                         is "mortifyingly ashamed", so chances 
                         are he'll be so grateful for any non-
                         judgmental attention, that he'll be 
                         yours forever.

                                     LILA
                         God, he must be really close to your 
                         brother to tell him such personal 
                         stuff.

                                     ROSE
                         Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               It's a chi-chi place. Lila sits at a table with Nathan, 
               fastidious in dress and manner. There is an awkward firstdate 
               silence. She sneaks a glance at his crotch. Then:

                         Meditations on a Banana Slug was a 
                         delightful read.

                                     LILA
                         Thank you so much. I love slugs. All 
                         slugs, not just banana slugs.

                                     NATHAN
                         As do I.

                                     LILA
                         They're so even keel. They forge 
                         ahead with slow determination. They 
                         don't get distracted or side-tracked. 
                         They don't care what they look like.
                         They don't care that people look at 
                         them and go, "Ewww. A slug."

                                     NATHAN
                         They don't seem to be especially ego 
                         driven, this is true.

                                     LILA
                         You've got to respect that.

                                     NATHAN
                         I have to say that I'm not there 
                         yet.

                                     LILA
                         Where?

                                     NATHAN
                         Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd 
                         call it. I'm not there yet. I still 
                         have many human characteristics.

                                     LILA
                         That's not necessarily a bad thing.

                                     NATHAN
                         Yes. I suppose not. But still. One 
                         would like to move along. To move 
                         beyond.

                                     LILA
                         I'm not sure we can escape our 
                         natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm 
                         not even so sure anymore that we 
                         should want to.

                                     NATHAN
                         I love that you said that. It makes 
                         me feel a bit lighter. I've been 
                         rather heavy lately. Thinking about 
                         my childhood. Realizing how much a 
                         product I am of my upbringing.
                              (beat, cautiously)
                         I've been seeing someone. A therapist.

                                     LILA
                              (feigning surprise)
                         You are a therapist, right?

                                     NATHAN
                         No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do 
                         research. I'm a behaviorist. I work 
                         with animals. Mice at the moment.

                                     LILA
                         I hope you don't perform any of those 
                         dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                         Heavens no. My work now is... Right 
                         now I'm teaching mice... well, table 
                         manners, to be candid.

                                     LILA
                              (beat. doesn't know 
                              what to say)
                         How's it going?

                                     NATHAN
                         Quite well, really. It's a lot of 
                         work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly 
                         positive. Right now I've gotten two 
                         of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny 
                         napkins of course.

                                     LILA
                         Paper or cloth?

                                     NATHAN
                         I hope you don't think me daft. It's 
                         important work. It's part of a larger 
                         sociological experiment. I'm federally 
                         funded.

                                     LILA
                         What's the larger experiment?

                                     NATHAN
                         It's my thesis that if table manners 
                         can be taught to mice, they can be 
                         taught to humans.

                                     LILA
                         Going out on a limb, aren't you, 
                         Nathan?

                                     NATHAN
                              (speech)
                         The truth is most people don't have 
                         table manners today. And when the 
                         foundations of civilized society 
                         crumble and disappear, civilized 
                         society in its entirely follows 
                         closely at its heels.

                                     LILA
                         I'm not sure.

                                     NATHAN
                              (stridently)
                         Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all 
                         sadly lacking from our daily 
                         intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, 
                         meanness are the norm.

                                     LILA
                         We are animals after all.

                                     NATHAN
                         Ergo if I can teach table manners to 
                         mice, I can teach them to humans. If 
                         I can teach table manners to humans, 
                         I can save the world.

               Nathan blushes. Lila stares at him for a long moment. Her 
               thoughts are unreadable.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Yeah. Says he likes you even more 
                         than he likes his own mother. And 
                         according to my brother Nathan's

                         I began going to a therapist when I 
                         was in my thirties, because I felt 
                         that I wasn't enjoying life the way 
                         my friends were.

               It is another sepia scene. Nathan as a ten year old sits at 
               the table with his parents. There is a bowl of salad in front 
               of each of them. Everyone's head is bowed in prayer.

                                     FATHER
                         Lord, we thank you for this bountiful 
                         gift we are about to receive.

                                     ALL
                         Amen.

               Eyes open, and young Nathan reaches for a fork to eat the 
               salad. He grabs the wrong fork. Mother's eyes widen in horror.

                                     MOTHER
                         My God, no! My God!
                              (disappointed)
                         Oh, Nathan.

               Nathan looks up.

                                     MOTHER
                         That is the wrong fork, young man.
                              (to father)
                         Harold, tell the boy.

                                     FATHER
                         That is the wrong fork, young man.

                                     NATHAN AS A BOY
                              (panicky)
                         I'll use the right one. I'm sorry. I 
                         forgot.

                                     MOTHER
                         Harold, tell the boy more.

                                     FATHER
                         Too late. Go to your room.

                                     NATHAN AS A BOY
                         But...

                                     MOTHER
                         Harold! Tell the boy again.

                                     FATHER
                              (looking at mother)
                         No "buts." Go to your room now.

                                     MOTHER
                              (looking at father)
                         And?

                                     FATHER
                         And think about what you've done.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY

               Adult Nathan sits on the couch, dabbing at his eyes.

               Wendall, his therapist sits across from him and writes 
               something in his notebook.

                                     WENDALL
                         And do you think maybe this early 
                         childhood indoctrination has something 
                         to do with your interest in table 
                         manners in the present.

               Nathan thinks long and hard about this. He seems to be really 
               straining, squinting his eyes. Finally:

                                     NATHAN
                         I don't think so. No.

               Wendall nods and scribbles something on his pad.

                                     NATHAN
                         Why do you ask?

               Wendall looks up.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Everything's white. People in lab coats hustle back and forth. 
               Nathan, also in a lab coat, is hovering over a Lucite 
               encasement. Inside we see two white mice, both attached to 
               electrodes. They sit in little chairs at a little table. In 
               front of each of them is a little plate of salad and three 
               forks of varying size under Lucite domes.

               Nathan nods to his pretty French assistant, Gabrielle, who 
               presses a button. The Lucite domes over the salads lift.

               Tentatively both mice reach for a fork. There is a tiny piece 
               of velcro on each mouse's paw and a tiny piece of velcro on 
               each of the forks. The first mouse picks the correct fork, 
               and stabs it into the salad and eats happily, relieved. The 
               second mouse picks the wrong fork. Nathan presses a button, 
               which sends the mouse flying off his chair with an electric 
               shock. The correct mouse keeps eating, unconcerned. Nathan 
               makes a note in his notebook.

               Gabrielle watches Nathan as he writes, enchanted.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The table is elegantly set, candlelit. Lila sits at it while 
               Nathan fusses in the kitchenette. Something classical wafts 
               over from the stereo in the living room. Nathan places a 
               salad in front of Lila and sits across from her with his own 
               salad.

                                     LILA
                         It looks wonderful.

                                     NATHAN
                         You look wonderful. I'm on top of 
                         the world tonight, Lila. Work is 
                         going splendidly and my personal 
                         life is ...

               Lila picks up a fork from the inside of her setting, not the 
               outside. Nathan blinks. Lila tastes the salad.

                                     LILA
                         Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is 
                         delish...

                                     NATHAN
                              (clenched teeth)
                         My God! The fork! The fork!

                                     LILA
                         I'm sorry?

                                     NATHAN
                              (strangely)
                         Tell her, Harold...
                              (stops himself)
                         It's just that... It's nothing. It's 
                         just that the outside fork is the 
                         salad fork. One goes from the outside 
                         in as the dinner progresses.

                                     LILA
                         Oh, I'm sorry.
                              (picks up correct 
                              fork)
                         I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really 
                         learned those things.

                                     NATHAN
                              (forced casual)
                         No biggie.

               There is a long silence as they both eat the salad.

                                     LILA
                         Boy, this is good!

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm sorry that I became so upset.

                                     LILA
                         No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward 
                         in certain areas.

                                     NATHAN
                              (beat, blurting)
                         It's only that I really enjoy your 
                         company and...

                                     LILA
                         You do?

                                     NATHAN
                         Yes, and...

                                     LILA
                         You really enjoy my company?

                                     NATHAN
                         Yes.
                              (beat, blurting)
                         Please don't talk with food in your 
                         mouth, Lila. Please. You're so pretty 
                         and it only mars your... I'm sorry. 
                         I'm being critical.

               Nathan pounds his forehead with his fist. Lila waves her 
               hand to indicate that it's fine. She doesn't say anything 
               because she's chewing.

                                     NATHAN
                         It's just that I have some 
                         peculiarities, and...

                                     LILA
                         I like you, too, Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                         You do?

                                     LILA
                         Yeah
                              (beat)
                         But I have some peculiarities also.

                                     NATHAN
                              (happily)
                         I don't care. I don't care!
                              (then, concerned)
                         Like what, for example?

               Lila takes a deep breath, about to go into it, thinks better 
               of it.

                                     LILA
                         Like nothing.

               Nathan smiles, relieved. Lila smiles back. Nathan recoils 
               slightly, skittishly half-points to his bared teeth.

               Apparently there's a piece of food stuck in Lila's teeth.

               She closes her mouth, runs her tongue over her teeth, smiles 
               again, mouth closed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ELECTROLOGIST'S OFFICE -DAY

               Rose is doing Lila's feet.

                                     ROSE
                         My brother says things are going 
                         really well between you and Nathan.

                                     LILA
                         I cannot believe how in love I am 
                         with this man.

                                     ROSE
                         Yeah?

                                     LILA
                         He's so cute. I even like his cute 
                         little penis. It's like a little 
                         pig's penis or something.
                              (beat)
                         Rose, we connect on every level. 
                         I've finally found someone I can 
                         feel completely safe with.

                                     ROSE
                         Don't throw that away. I had that 
                         once with a guy. But I threw it away 
                         for a cheap thrill.

                                     LILA
                         One night stand?

                                     ROSE
                         No. I married a midget.

                                     LILA
                         Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?

                                     ROSE
                         Well he wasn't really a midget. He 
                         was on the cusp of midgethood. That's 
                         what made it cheap. Had he been an 
                         actual midget, there would've been 
                         nothing cheap about it, my dear.

                                     LILA
                         I didn't know you were into that 
                         sort of thing.

                                     ROSE
                         Let me tell you, honey, midgets are 
                         the best kept secret in male 
                         companionship. They're portable. 
                         They're controllable. They're eager. 
                         And they're exactly the right height 
                         for a little covert oral fun on the 
                         dance floor.

                         I have a friend you might like to 
                         meet.

                         Oh?

                         Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's 
                         asked me to move in with him.

                                     ROSE
                         Yeah. My brother told me.

                                     LILA
                         And I think I'm going to.

               INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY

               Nathan talks.

                                     NATHAN
                         Lila moved in with me. Did I love 
                         her? I thought so. But from my new 
                         vantage point I realize that love is 
                         nothing more than a messy 
                         conglomeration of need, desperation, 
                         fear of death, insecurity about penis 
                         size, and the self-involved, ego 
                         driven need to collect other people's 
                         hearts. Not that I judge it.
                              (puts head in hands. 
                              beat. looks up)
                         Listen, I don't want to be dead yet. 
                         Is there any way to...

               Nathan looks around for some sign of another person. There 
               is nobody.

                                     NATHAN
                         No I suppose not.
                              (beat)
                         No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in. We 
                         had our problems, but we both wanted 
                         love so badly, we turned a blind 
                         eye.

               INT. NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Nathan, Lila, and Nathan's parents (looking very, very old) 
               sit at the dining room table. Salad is about to be eaten, 
               and everyone glances sideways over at Lila, waiting for her 
               to make her move. She reaches for the wrong fork, corrects 
               herself and picks the salad fork. Nathan breathes a sigh of 
               relief. His mother looks disappointed, clucks. They eat in 
               silence. Finally:

                                     LILA
                         It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr. 
                         and Mrs. Bronfman. I've heard so 
                         much about you and I've seen you in 
                         photographs from Nathan's childhood, 
                         but it's nice to meet you in the 
                         flesh. I must say, you look exactly 
                         the same as in the photographs.

                                     MOTHER
                         Thank you, dear.

                                     NATHAN
                         Actually, Mother and Father, you 
                         look very, very old. You look 
                         terrible.

                                     LILA
                         Nathan!

               His mother and father touch their faces reflexively, then 
               look at each other and laugh.

                                     MOTHER
                         Tell him, Harold.

                                     FATHER
                         Son, your mother and I are doing a 
                         production of The Gin Game at the 
                         local community theater. We forgot 
                         to take off our make-up.

               The mother and father laugh again. Then they pull at their 
               latex faces. The wrinkles come off. And they look exactly as 
               they did in the flashback scene, albeit a bit pink-faced.

               There is another pause.

                                     LILA
                              (awkward)
                         Goodness, you two look exactly as 
                         you did in those old photos.

                                     MOTHER
                              (cold)
                         Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear.

                                     NATHAN
                              (changing the subject)
                         Lila's a nature writer, mother.

                                     MOTHER
                         I love nature. As long as it stays 
                         in the zoo where it belongs.

               The father and Nathan laugh at mother's joke. Lila joins in 
               weakly, against her better judgment.

                                     MOTHER
                              (to Lila)
                         Don't you agree, dear?

               Lila hesitates.

                                     NATHAN
                         Of course she does, mother.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATHAN AND LILA'S BEDROOM - LATER

               Nathan is in bed, in starched pajamas. He lies on his back 
               under perfect covers and stares straight up at the ceiling.

                                     NATHAN
                         What are you doing in there?

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                              (pissy)
                         I'll be out in a minute.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm sorry about my parents.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         You didn't seem sorry when you were 
                         laughing at all your mother's stupid, 
                         tasteless, cruel animal jokes.

                                     NATHAN
                         I was simply attempting to keep the 
                         evening light. You know that I feel 
                         similarly to you about nature.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Do you?

                                     NATHAN
                         Of course.
                              (beat)
                         I simply love the... naturalness of 
                         it all.

               Lila emerges from the bathroom, radiant, hopeful.

                                     LILA
                         Do you? Oh do you, darling?

                                     NATHAN
                         Why certainly!

               Lila happily leaps into bed. She smothers Nathan with kisses.

                                     LILA
                         Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's 
                         celebrate with a long hike in the 
                         woods tomorrow!

                                     NATHAN
                              (oh shit)
                         That's a great idea.

               Nathan kisses her.

                                     LILA
                         It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my 
                         old stomping grounds!

                                     NATHAN
                         Terrific. Can't wait!

               Nathan kisses her ear. He looks confused, sticks his finger 
               behind her ear, and pulls it out with a dab of shaving cream 
               on it.

                                     NATHAN
                         Shaving cream?

                                     LILA
                         I don't think so.
                              (beat)
                         Why?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - MORNING

               Nathan drives. He's dressed in spanking new, freshly starched 
               safari clothes, big shiny new hiking boots. Lila sits in the 
               front passenger seat. She is dressed in a costume identical 
               to Nathan's, but, as opposed to Nathan, she seems awkward in 
               it. She fidgets in it, straightens it, sighs, comes to terms 
               with it, and looks dreamily out the window at the passing 
               trees. She is home. That's all that matters.

                                     NATHAN
                         Darling, did you bring the insect 
                         repellent lotion?

                                     LILA
                         Yes, darling.

                                     NATHAN
                              (beat)
                         Oh, and the sun block?

                                     LILA
                         Of course.

                                     NATHAN
                         What SPF, sweetie?

                                     LILA
                         Fifteen.

                                     NATHAN
                         Perfectomundo! We are ready!
                              (beat)
                         Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to 
                         have an insect repellent lotion that 
                         also worked as a sun block? Think of 
                         all the time one would save.

                                     LILA
                         Yes, darling.

                                     NATHAN
                         I think I'll get Johannsen in 
                         chemistry on that.
                              (beat)
                         Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit?

                                     LILA
                         Yes.

                                     NATHAN
                         Flares?

                         Absolutely.

                         We could call it "Quit Bugging Me, 
                         Sunny."
                              (laughs a lot)
                         Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y.

                                     LILA
                              (laughs appreciatively)
                         That's very funny.

                                     NATHAN
                         I love you so much.

                         Then, gentlemen, one day I saw 
                         something I hadn't seen since my 
                         father died in a freak accident 
                         involving a rotted log and four 
                         thousand bees stinging his head... I 
                         saw other human beings. They chattered 
                         away at each other in what appeared 
                         to be gibberish. Later I learned it 
                         was English. Now I wonder if perhaps 
                         my initial assessment hadn't been 
                         correct.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Puff's POV: Through some brush we watch Nathan and Lila

               distance, the relentless gibberish chatter of Nathan and 
               Lila. Puff moves. Lila glances over.

                         deer immediately. Too... upright.

                              (nervously)
                         It might behoove us to turn back at 
                         this point.

               Lila walks in the direction of the sighting.

                                     LILA
                         Come on.

                                     NATHAN
                              (not budging)
                         If it's a person, why should we go 
                         see it? It's not like it's nature or 
                         anything. It's just a person.
                              (beat)
                         Sometimes people who live in the 
                         woods don't want to be seen. They 
                         live in the woods because they're 
                         anti-social, Lila. We have to respect 
                         that.

               Lila trudges through the brush. Nathan follows. Better than 
               being left behind.

                                     NATHAN
                         This is the way to get ticks, Lila. 
                         This is it. Bingo! Lyme Disease! 
                         You've hit the nail on the head here.

               Lila is in her element. Her whole demeanor has changed.

               She is tracking. She sniffs the breeze, cocks her head, moves 
               stealthily. Then she sheds her clothes, almost shaking them 
               off, like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had 
               dressed him in.

                                     NATHAN
                         Oh for God's sa...

               Lila turns her head and glares at Nathan. There is an animal 
               fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly.

               She turns back to pursue her prey.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

               Puff testifies.

                                     PUFF
                         I had never seen anything like it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Puff's POV: We see a naked Lila looking in our general 
               direction, but not seeing us. The sun dapples her body.

               She moves closer and closer.

                                     PUFF (V.O.)
                         It was an ape as I had never seen 
                         before. Like me, yet different in 
                         certain essential details. And all 
                         at once I felt a heat pass through 
                         me. My heart raced. Gentlemen, I 
                         wanted to touch her, to caress her, 
                         to be one with her. I had urges and 
                         desires I could not explain. I felt 
                         overwhelmed by the power this strange 
                         creature had over me, and so I did 
                         what any animal would do when it 
                         comes across an animal of superior 
                         strength...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               The cops are transfixed.

                                     LILA
                         He bolted.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FOREST - DAY

               We are with Lila. She creeps along, when suddenly a tan, 
               muscular figure tears out from behind a tree and runs, 
               practically on all fours, through the dense underbrush.

               Lila follows, almost as agile as the forest creature.

               Nathan just stands there. The chase continues. There is a 
               great deal of heaving and panting. Puff shimmies up a large 
               tree. Lila follows. Puff leaps from branch to branch.

               Lila follows easily. Puff swings from a vine. So does Lila. 
               Finally they come to the end of the trees, a clearing. There 
               is no nowhere for Puff to leap. Lila is with him in the tree. 
               They are crouched, bloody, heaving, on separate branches, 
               staring at each other. After a long moment, Lila speaks.

                                     LILA
                         Who are you?

               Puff cocks his head. The high timbre of her voice surprises 
               him, pleases him, but he doesn't understand the words.

                                     LILA
                         You don't understand my language, do 
                         you?

               Puff looks at his crotch. Apparently there is some activity 
               down there. Lila, following his eyes, glances down there 
               also.

                                     LILA
                              (laughing)
                         I take it back, you do understand my 
                         language.

               Puff grabs for his crotch and begins to play with himself 
               distractedly, looking at her all the while. He falls out of 
               the tree. Lila gasps. Branches crack and snap as he passes 
               through them and then there is an unpleasant thud when he 
               hits the forest floor. Lila shimmies down the tree, and kneels 
               by Puff. He is unconscious.

                                     LILA
                         Oh God.

               Nathan comes limping through the brush. Somehow his safari 
               suit and boots are as clean and pressed as they were in the 
               car. He is carrying Lila's clothes. Somehow he has had time 
               to neatly fold them.

                                     NATHAN
                         Oh my God! Is he dead? Please put 
                         something on.

               Lila looks up at icily at Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                         You'll catch cold. It's cold.
                              (beat)
                         What do you suppose he is, a 
                         survivalist?

                                     LILA
                         I think he's feral.

                                     NATHAN
                              (jumping back)
                         Feral? Don't touch him! He might be 
                         diseased! He might... My God, rabies!

                                     LILA
                         He looks perfectly fine.

                                     NATHAN
                         I think we should go. Please. Before 
                         he wakes up and, I don't know, eats 
                         us, or whatever feral things do.

                                     LILA
                         I don't understand you. This is 
                         fascinating and you just want to run 
                         away. I mean, here we have a human 
                         being totally uncontaminated by 
                         civilization, totally free, and all 
                         you want to do is run back to your...

                                     NATHAN
                              (thinking)
                         Actually, I just had an amusing 
                         thought.

                                     LILA
                         What?

                                     NATHAN
                              (musing)
                         Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated?

                                     LILA
                         Look at him. He doesn't understand 
                         English. He moves like an animal.

                                     NATHAN
                         It's perfect!

                                     LILA
                         Nathan, what the hell are you talking 
                         about?

                                     NATHAN
                              (doing a little dance)
                         Forget mice! Actually forget guinea 
                         pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. 
                         I'm on to stage five: The human 
                         subject.

                                     LILA
                         Oh no. You can't take him from his 
                         home, Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                              (ranting)
                         Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, 
                         my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to 
                         the top of the Behaviorist food chain. 
                         He's going to make me famous.

                                     LILA
                         I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's 
                         happy here.

                                     NATHAN
                         Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy 
                         and naked alone in this tick infested 
                         wilderness? Never to know the love 
                         of a good woman, never to revel in 
                         the pitter-patter of little feet, 
                         never to read Moby Dick, or marvel 
                         at a Monet, or just sit back after a 
                         day of hard but rewarding work, smoke 
                         a pipe, and wonder about the nature 
                         of reality.

                                     LILA
                              (weakening resolve)
                         You'd be taking away his freedom, 
                         Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                         Freedom's just another word for 
                         nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote 
                         Janet Jackson.

               Lila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with 
               tears. As Nathan continues his speech, we move closer and 
               closer into Lila's eyes. Nathan's voice fades into nothing 
               by the time we dissolve.

                                     NATHAN
                         Belonging to something, a person or 
                         a society, is a basic human craving. 
                         We are communal creatures. This poor 
                         soul has no one, nothing...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CLIFF - SUNSET

               A naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and 
               watches the sunset. There's a chill in the air and she shivers 
               and hugs herself.

                                     LILA
                         Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You 
                         give me this beautiful gift, this 
                         glorious sunset. But with no one to 
                         say "isn't that a beautiful sunset" 
                         to, it becomes meaningless, just 
                         another stupid sunset. They happen 
                         everyday. So what?

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Lila is hovering over the unconscious Puff. Nathan's voice 
               comes back into focus. He is still speechifying.

                                     NATHAN
                         ...what is it that makes us human, 
                         if not the knowledge that we are 
                         indeed human? Think of this poor 
                         soul's education as the greatest 
                         gift we could bestow upon...

                                     LILA
                         All right.

                                     NATHAN
                         Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw 
                         him in the trunk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Nathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table 
               in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door 
               opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a 
               chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and 
               the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the 
               other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The 
               Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both 
               mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan 
               scribbles in his notebook.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Doctor...

               Nathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction 
               of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a 
               diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. 
               Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over.

                                     NATHAN
                         Good morning.

               Puff groggily takes in his surroundings. This is quite a lot 
               to take in. The white room, the strange apes in strange suits, 
               his own clothing, the wires. After surveying the scene for a 
               moment, Puff becomes frightened and agitated.

               He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes 
               into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan 
               gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel.

               An electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor 
               confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again 
               crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle 
               and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and 
               crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up 
               again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks 
               better of it, and squats in place, immobilized.

                                     NATHAN
                              (to Gabrielle)
                         Only three shocks. A chimp takes 
                         fifteen. This is going to be tres 
                         simple, no, Gabrielle?

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (in love with Nathan)
                         Oui, doctor, oui.

                                     NATHAN
                              (to Puff)
                         Good morning...
                              (to Gabrielle)
                         We need a name for him, don't we?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Oui.

                                     NATHAN
                         You decide. Today is your day.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet 
                         little mongrel puppie named Puff 
                         when I was a girl. This one reminds 
                         me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute!
                              (giggles girlishly)
                         I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.

                                     NATHAN
                              (charmed)
                         Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is 
                         that okay?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Oui. Perfect!

                                     NATHAN
                              (to Puff)
                         Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. 
                         Bronfman and this is my assistant 
                         Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy 
                         while you are here.

               Gabrielle likes this concept a great deal. She smiles and 
               moves closer to Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                              (to Puff)
                         How about some salad, son?

               Gabrielle poises her finger above the button. She winks at 
               Nathan. He blushes.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - EVENING

               Nathan, carrying a brief case, is walking to his car.

               Gabrielle hurries to catch up to him. Her high heels click 
               on the pavement.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman!

               Nathan turns.

                                     NATHAN
                         Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (out of breath)
                         Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I 
                         very much enjoy working with you.
                              (blushes)
                         Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.

               They walk along.

                                     NATHAN
                         No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing 
                         that. You're a terrific assistant.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Merci. I... Do you... would you like 
                         to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?

                                     NATHAN
                         Well, I don't know. I'm actually on 
                         my way to...

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive 
                         me. I should not have asked such a 
                         stupid question. I know you are a 
                         very important man and...

                                     NATHAN
                         No. Don't be silly. It's just...

                                     GABRIELLE
                         I am a foolish little thing. I am 
                         pink in my face, no? It is only that 
                         I have been so lonely lately and... 
                         I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, 
                         okay? Unless... Am I fired now?

               Gabrielle pouts. Nathan is charmed.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING

               Nathan and Gabrielle sit at a romantic little table in a 
               trendy coffee shop.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Thank you so much for accompanying 
                         me.

                                     NATHAN
                         Not at all.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         I have had such a difficult time in 
                         my personal life and you seem to be 
                         such a nice man... but I'm talking 
                         too much again, no?

                                     NATHAN
                         Of course not.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You're so sweet. Oh, why are there 
                         not more men out there like you?

               Gabrielle starts to cry softly. Nathan doesn't know what to 
               do. His eyes dart around, then:

                                     NATHAN
                         There there.

               Gabrielle looks up at him appreciatively. She sniffs.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You know just the right thing to 
                         say.

               She reaches across the table and touches his hand lightly 
               for a moment.

                                     NATHAN
                         Listen, you're the best assistant 
                         I've ever had... Gabrielle.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (smiles)
                         I like it when you say my name. Is 
                         that stupid?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Nathan, in his pajamas, lies in bed reading. He looks up.

                                     NATHAN
                         What are you doing in there?

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Nothing. Be right out.

               The phone rings. Nathan picks it up.

                                     NATHAN
                         Hello?
                              (beat, happily)
                         Oh, hi... Gabrielle!

               Nathan sits up in bed.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Who is it?

                                     NATHAN
                         Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.

               Nathan laughs.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Who is it?

                                     NATHAN
                              (into phone)
                         Absolutely, Gabrielle.
                              (covering phone, 
                              testily)
                         Someone from work!
                              (into phone)
                         Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. 
                         Exactly.

               Nathan laughs.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Who from work?

                                     NATHAN
                              (into phone)
                         Excuse me one second, would you, 
                         Gabrielle?

               Nathan puts down the phone and heads to the bathroom.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Who is it, Nathan?

               Nathan opens the bathroom door.

                                     NATHAN
                         Look, Lila, when I'm on a work...

               Lila turns with a gasp. She has shaving cream all over her 
               chest. Nathan looks stunned. He backs away.

                                     LILA
                         Nathan, I...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               The lights are low. The room is peppered with lit candles.

               Gabrielle, in a slip, lies on her bed, eating cherries from 
               a bowl, and listening to Nathan and Lila's conversation on 
               speaker.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help 
                         it. I'm sorry.

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         Your entire body?

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         I'm getting electrolysis. It's 
                         working, but it takes time. So 
                         meanwhile I have to...

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         You have to shave? Like an ape?

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                              (crying)
                         Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         Don't quibble. You know what I mean.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me 
                         for this.

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         Mad? I'm I'm... disgusted!

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         I'm the same person I was before you 
                         knew, damn it! Oh God!

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         I have to think! I have to think!

               Footsteps and a door slam. Lila is near the phone now and 
               crying in desperate heaves.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Oh God, why... do... I... have... 
                         to... be... like... Oh, no! Oh, shit!
                              (rustling sound, then 
                              into phone)
                         Hello? Hello? Is anyone there? Who's 
                         there?

               Gabrielle calmly pops another cherry in her mouth and hangs 
               up the phone.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Nathan, in his pajamas, drives. His face is set in a furious 
               scowl and he drives fast.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANOTHER CAR - NIGHT

               Gabrielle drives leisurely. She is calm, a slight smile on 
               her face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - NIGHT

               Nathan paces in front of Puff's Lucite case. Puff watches 
               suspiciously from the corner where he is huddled. The lights 
               are off. But there is a green glow from a couple of exit 
               signs.

                                     NATHAN
                         I don't get it. I don't get it. I 
                         don't get it. How could I find myself 
                         in this mess? This is a mess. This 
                         is not a situation I understand. 
                         This is a mess. How do I extricate 
                         myself from this mess? Is my 
                         girlfriend a man? I don't understand. 
                         This is not part of any plan. She 
                         deceived me. She has hair.
                              (beat)
                         But am I being fair? So what if she 
                         has hair? Who am I to judge? I have 
                         hair.
                              (beat)
                         But I'm supposed to have hair. I am 
                         a man. Men are supposed to have hair.
                              (beat)
                         But poor Lila. Think of what she's 
                         had to go through. The courage she's 
                         had to have in the face of this 
                         abomination of nature. I should love 
                         her all the more. I should love every 
                         hair on her body. I mean, she doesn't 
                         mind that I have a mortifyingly 
                         small...

               The lights flick on. Nathan turns with a start. It's 
               Gabrielle. She's in an overcoat. She gasps.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry 
                         to disturb you. I just came for some 
                         papers I left.

                                     NATHAN
                         Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled 
                         you. I came to think.
                              (beat, remembering)
                         God, Did I hang up on you?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. 
                         I am sorry.

                                     NATHAN
                         No. I just got distracted. I'm so 
                         sorry.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Is everything fine?

                                     NATHAN
                         Oui.
                              (laughs)
                         Now you've got me talking French.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (laughs)
                         I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered 
                         I left some papers I need to go over.
                              (opens overcoat to 
                              reveal lingerie)
                         See? I rushed right out of the house.
                         I must look a mess. I'm so 
                         embarrassed.

                                     NATHAN
                              (taken)
                         I'm in my p.j.'s, too. Funny, huh?

               Puff is taken also. His eyes are wide.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Coincidence, yes?
                              (beat)
                         And how is our son?

                                     NATHAN
                         Our...? Oh!
                              (laughs, out of control)
                         He seems fine. I guess we woke him. 
                         The lights and all.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         I should turn them off.
                              (she does)
                         Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama 
                         sang to me when I was a little girl.

                                     NATHAN
                              (a little giddy)
                         When you were a little French girl?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Oui.

                                     NATHAN
                              (back in control)
                         That would be good.

               Gabrielle kneels by Puff's case. Puff crawls over, tries to 
               touch her through the Lucite. Gabrielle sings a French 
               lullaby. It's very sweet. Nathan watches her, looks at her 
               thigh, her hair, the delicate way the tip of her nose moves 
               when she sings. Puff gets drowsy. He curls up on the floor 
               and sleeps.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (quietly to Nathan)
                         There.

               Nathan stares at her, transfixed. She pretends not to notice.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Shall we close up, then?

                                     NATHAN
                         Maybe we should just sit for a while. 
                         It's very peaceful.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into 
                         you, both in our silly pajamas. It 
                         is two happy coincidences, no?

                                     NATHAN
                         Yes. Happy happy.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Yet you look so sad. A great man 
                         like you should not be sad.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all.

               Gabrielle stands. She stretches languorously, revealing a 
               lot of leg.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         I am sleepy.

                                     NATHAN
                         I shouldn't say this, but you're 
                         pretty, Gabrielle. It's 
                         unprofessional, I know.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Really? I always think myself so 
                         ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A 
                         wallflower.

                                     NATHAN
                              (buying her line)
                         Really? No. Not at all. You're a 
                         very pretty girl. You should know 
                         that. You should be confident.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Thank you so much. Merci. It's very 
                         wonderful to hear a man say such a 
                         nice compliment.

                                     NATHAN
                         It's true. I wouldn't lie.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You are sweet.

               Gabrielle walks slowly by Nathan. He inhales deeply, breathing 
               her in. She smiles to herself. He reaches out touches her 
               leg.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (vaguely protesting)
                         Doctor.

               She moves into Nathan. She presses her thigh against his 
               shoulder. Nathan leans forward, kisses her exposed thigh.

                                     NATHAN
                         So soft. So smooth.
                              (back to reality)
                         I'm sorry. It's just...

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (soothing)
                         Shh.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Lila is shaving herself all over. Shaving and weeping.

               There are nicks all over her body. She has no eyebrows any 
               more. The hair on her head is hacked off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - NIGHT

               Nathan and Gabrielle are lying naked on the floor.

               Gabrielle rests her head on Nathan's chest.

                                     NATHAN
                         Was that okay? I mean, was I able 
                         to... satisfy you?

                                     LILA
                         You are an animal.

                                     NATHAN
                         Really? Wow! That's that's terrific 
                         to hear from someone so... feminine, 
                         so female.

                                     LILA
                         I love being female because it, how 
                         do you say, allows me to be close to 
                         men.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm glad you're female.
                              (beat)
                         Do you think our boy witnessed the 
                         primal scene?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Anyway it's time he grew up. N'est-
                         ce pa?
                              (sighing, running her 
                              fingers along his 
                              chest)
                         I love chest hair on a man. I know 
                         it isn't fashionable now, hairy men. 
                         But to me it is the very sign of 
                         masculinity.

               Nathan tenses. Gabrielle looks up innocently at him.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         What is wrong, my darling?

                                     NATHAN
                         Nothing, my darling. All is right 
                         with the world.

               Puff watches from his case. Gabrielle smiles to herself.

               INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

               Puff testifies.

                                     PUFF
                         I saw it, gentlemen. I saw the whole 
                         sweaty, passionate, ugly, beautiful 
                         act, and to use the vernacular, I 
                         wanted me some of that.

               The congressmen laugh appreciatively. The laughter is a little 
               too enthusiastic and goes on a little too long. It stops 
               abruptly.

                                     PUFF
                         And I think I understood from that 
                         moment, that in order to get some, I 
                         would have to do what they said. In 
                         order to experience this primal, 
                         basic, animal thing, I would first 
                         have to become a civilized, prissy, 
                         uptight human. I would have to become 
                         Nathan.

               The congressmen nod sadly, in recognition of this reality.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Puff, in his Lucite case, sits behind a set dinner table.

               He seems attentive, calm, interested as Nathan teaches him 
               table manners. Gabrielle stands very close, almost 
               possessively close, to Nathan. She wears a lab coat, but it 
               is unbuttoned, and underneath she is wearing a skin-tight 
               black minidress. She strokes the back of Nathan's head as he 
               works with Puff.

                                     NATHAN
                              (slow. talking to an 
                              idiot)
                         Excellent, Puff. Now, the lady you're 
                         with excuses herself to go powder 
                         her nose.

               The wheels turn in Puff's head. He thinks hard. Then he 
               stands. Gabrielle shrieks and claps happily.

                                     NATHAN
                         Perfect. Perfect, Puff!

               Nathan leans over and kisses Gabrielle. Puff watches. He 
               makes an exaggerated kissy-face, pursing his lips, trying to 
               imitate Nathan. The phone rings. Gabrielle pulls herself 
               away, giggles as Nathan tries to keep her from going, and 
               picks up the phone.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (still giggling)
                         Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment 
                         please.
                              (puts it on hold)
                         Lila.

                                     NATHAN
                         Shit.
                              (takes phone)
                         Hi, honey.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILA AND NATHAN'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Lila sits on the couch. Eyebrows are attractively drawn onto 
               her face. She wears a very femme blonde wing. Lots of make-
               up.

                                     LILA
                         So, how's it going today?

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         Good. Making progress.

                                     LILA
                         Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, 
                         about stuff? Things have been so 
                         strained for the past three weeks, 
                         since you know, and I just want to 
                         talk.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - CONTINUOUS

               Nathan, phone cradled between shoulder and ear, puts his 
               face in his hand. Gabrielle rests a hand on his shoulder.

                                     NATHAN
                         Everything's fine, honey. We don't 
                         need to talk. Besides I have to work 
                         late.

                                     LILA (O.S.)
                         Please, Nathan. I really need this. 
                         You've been working late a lot.

               Nathan looks up helplessly at Gabrielle.

                                     NATHAN
                         Okay, we'll have dinner tonight.

               Gabrielle gets mad, exhales sharply, pulls her hand away.

               Nathan gives her a pleading look, grabs for her. She moves 
               away.

                                     NATHAN
                         Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. 
                         Bye.
                              (hangs up)
                         What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed 
                         to do?

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (disgusted)
                         I don't know, Nathan. What are you 
                         supposed to do?

                                     NATHAN
                         You don't abandon somebody because 
                         they have a physical problem.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Funny. I thought that's exactly what 
                         you did. You just don't have the 
                         courage to admit it to yourself.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY

               Nathan talks. A tear runs down his face, mingles with the 
               blood.

                                     NATHAN
                         Funny. I still feel guilt. Even dead. 
                         One would've hoped... But alas. You 
                         know, I really did love Lila. But 
                         with her... problem... and then when 
                         Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And 
                         Gabrielle was so... conventionally 
                         female. And she had an accent. I was 
                         lost from that moment on. But 
                         Gabrielle was right. I couldn't admit 
                         it to myself, this shallowness of 
                         character, let alone to Lila.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Lila and Nathan eat. Lila is in her new, very feminine make-
               up, wig, and dress. Her table manners are impeccable, almost 
               robotic. There is an awkward silence

                                     LILA
                         Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? 
                         I just have to know.

                                     NATHAN
                         Of course not.

                                     LILA
                         It would just be helpful to know.

                                     NATHAN
                         No.

                                     LILA
                         Because, you know, you seem so 
                         distant. And you work late every 
                         night. And we hardly ever have sex, 
                         and when we do, it's... I don't know. 
                         It feels different.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm just preoccupied.

                                     LILA
                         Do you like my new look?

                                     NATHAN
                         Yeah. It's nice. It's really good.

                                     LILA
                         I'm trying, you know.
                              (starting to cry)
                         I'm trying to be what you want. I 
                         want to be what you want, Nathan. 
                         All I want is to be what you want.

                                     NATHAN
                              (embarrassed)
                         Shh. It's okay.
                              (takes her hand)
                         It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. 
                         You know that. You're exactly what I 
                         want.

                              (hopefully, sniffing)
                         Really?

                                     NATHAN
                         Sure. Of course.

                                     LILA
                         Because I'm really trying, you know. 
                         Rosie says maybe only another two 
                         years of the elctrolysis.

                                     NATHAN
                              (hard to stomach)
                         That's great.

                         I've signed up for a ballet class. 
                         And look at my nails! A real girl!

               Lila holds out her hands. Her finger nails are polished fire 
               engine red.

                                     NATHAN
                         That's great. It's a great color for 
                         you.

               Lila holds and rocks a swaddled baby. She passes it to Nathan, 
               who looks at it and sees that it's a baby monkey.

               Nathan shudders. Lila looks on lovingly, oblivious.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               Nathan sits with his head in his hands. Wendall listens 
               attentively.

                                     NATHAN
                         So anyway, that's the nightmare I've 
                         been having lately.

                                     WENDALL
                         Do you suppose it has anything to do 
                         with Lila's unusually hairy body?

                                     NATHAN
                              (beat)
                         No, why?

                                     WENDALL
                         Well, it seems that since Lila 
                         broached the subject of children, 
                         you've been on edge and I know you 
                         have an issue with the, uh, body 
                         hair.

                                     NATHAN
                              (revelation)
                         Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to 
                         think about. That's very good. That's 
                         what you get the big bucks, right? 
                         Ha ha.

                                     WENDALL
                         I just think it might be important 
                         to explore your feelings for Lila.

                                     NATHAN
                         I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful 
                         person. And... she loves me! That's 
                         no small potatoes. I mean she really 
                         loves me. She's sacrificed so much 
                         to be in this relationship with me. 
                         And she's a good person. A truly 
                         good person. How rare is that in 
                         this world, eh? And how could I stop 
                         loving somebody because of a little 
                         physical imperfection, if it can 
                         even be called that. I mean, God 
                         knows I'm not perfect! What about my 
                         eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! 
                         Lila's not going to leave me because 
                         of my eyesight. What about my penis?

                                     WENDALL
                         And how do you feel about Gabrielle?

               Nathan puts his head in his hands and sighs.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Nathan is holding flash cards up to Puff. Puff tentatively 
               reads aloud from the cards. Gabrielle sits nearby on a stool, 
               fish-netted legs crossed, arms crossed, and an angry 
               expression on her face.

                                     PUFF

                                     NATHAN
                         Bravo, Puff! Bravo!

               Puff smiles happily. Nathan and Puff both look over at 
               Gabrielle for her approval. None is forthcoming.

                                     NATHAN
                         Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Hmmmph.

                                     NATHAN
                         Gabby, what is it?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Hmmph. Hmmph.
                              (beat)
                         Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.

                                     NATHAN
                         Fine.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Not in front of the boy.

                                     NATHAN
                         Very well.

               Gabrielle stands, turns, and stomps across the room. Nathan 
               follows her angry, switching hips with his eyes, as does 
               Puff. She exits into the hall. Nathan looks at Puff and 
               shrugs. Puff returns the shrug. Nathan follows Gabrielle 
               into the hall.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

               Gabrielle stands there waiting, a troubled look on her face, 
               her eyes brimming. Nathan emerges, tries to embrace her.

                                     NATHAN
                         My little French.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (pushing him away)
                         Stop. Get away.

                                     NATHAN
                         What is it?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You have to choose Nathan. It's like 
                         Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's 
                         choice. Did you ever see that movie, 
                         Sophie's Choice? It is like that. 
                         Only it is this.

                                     NATHAN
                         Gabby, you know I'm trying to sort 
                         things out.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (hard)
                         No! It is now that you must decide.
                              (soft)
                         I love you, Doctor Nathan...
                              (hard)
                         ...but I will not wait. I will not 
                         be your chippy. I will not be your 
                         little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side 
                         dish.
                              (soft)
                         My love. I want to have a sweet tiny 
                         baby inside my belly... from you.

               Nathan gets a faraway look in his eyes.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. BEACH - DAY

               Nathan and Gabrielle sit on a blanket on this otherwise empty 
               beach. There is a light breeze. Gabrielle has one of her 
               breasts exposed and is nursing an infant. Nathan looks at 
               the baby's face. It is angelic. He looks up and smiles at 
               Gabrielle. She smiles back. They kiss.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. HALL - DAY

               Nathan snaps out of his reverie, looks pleadingly at the 
               waiting Gabrielle.

                                     NATHAN
                         I love you so much, Gabrielle.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.

                                     NATHAN
                         But I don't know how to leave Lila.

               Gabrielle tears off her lab coat. Underneath she is wearing 
               practically nothing, a skimpy black dress. She throws the 
               lab coat at Nathan, turns and storms down the hall. Nathan 
               watches until she disappears around the corner.

                                     NATHAN
                              (quietly)
                         Now there's a butt, Nathan.

               He brings the lab coat up to his face and breathes in her 
               fragrance.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILA AND NATHAN'S - NIGHT

               Lila, all prettied up and civilized and manicured, is setting 
               the table for dinner. She is humming. Nathan walks in the 
               door. Lila doesn't hear him. He stands in the doorway for a 
               moment, watching Lila from behind. His face is blank. Lila 
               catches sight of him. She's startled.

                                     LILA
                         Oh!
                              (laughs)
                         I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!
                              (runs over and kisses 
                              him)
                         You're like a boy sneaking in...

                                     NATHAN
                              (so bored)
                         ...the back door of a movie theater. 
                         Yes, indeed.

                                     LILA
                         You remember that from my book? I'm 
                         touched!
                              (kisses him again)
                         What's wrong?

                                     NATHAN
                         Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink.

                                     LILA
                         I'll make it.
                              (beats him to the 
                              portable bar)
                         I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's 
                         going to be so great! Scotch on the 
                         rocks, right?
                              (giggles)
                         Just kidding. I know what you drink, 
                         mister. I know what you drink.
                              (pours and blends and 
                              shakes, etc.)
                         Voila!

               Lila hands Nathan a frothy pink concoction with a pineapple 
               wedge sticking out of it.

                                     NATHAN
                         Thanks.

               Nathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his 
               drink. Lila watches him, comes up behind him, puts her arms 
               around him. Nathan cringes, but tries to cover it. Lila feels 
               the cringe, but pretends not to have. She keeps her arms 
               around him for a moment longer, then casually removes them.

                                     LILA
                              (fishing)
                         How's work?

                                     NATHAN
                         Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?

                                     LILA
                              (pouty)
                         No. I don't want your work to be 
                         cruddy.

                                     NATHAN
                         My assistant quit today. Okay? He 
                         was highly valuable to the project.

                                     LILA
                         Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire 
                         somebody else?

                                     NATHAN
                         I guess.

               Lila screws up her face in concentration, trying to come 
               with a viable solution to Nathan's problem.

                                     LILA
                         Hey! I could come work for you! I 
                         know I haven't been all that 
                         supportive of this project, but I've 
                         come around.

                                     NATHAN
                         Have you?

                                     LILA
                         Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a 
                         wonderful project you're doing, taking 
                         this poor unfortunate, uncivilized 
                         creature and turning him into a human 
                         being! What a wonderful wonderful 
                         compassionate man you are!

                                     NATHAN
                         Really?

                                     LILA
                         Yes! And I want to help. You won't 
                         have to pay me, and I was thinking 
                         of giving up that crazy nature writing 
                         anyway.

                                     NATHAN
                         How come?

                                     LILA
                         Who needs it? I have you and I have 
                         being a woman and I have thinking 
                         about womanly things! I love being a 
                         woman because...

                                     NATHAN
                         Such as what womanly things?

                                     LILA
                         Such as my man and how to please 
                         him!
                              (kisses him)
                         Such as making wonderful dinners for 
                         my man!
                              (kisses him again, 
                              leads him to the 
                              table, sits him down)
                         Such as looking pretty for my man!
                              (kisses him again)
                         And I'm writing an article on quilting 
                         for the Ladies Home Journal!

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I had sold my fucking soul.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         I let her sell her soul. I stood by 
                         as she did it. It's inexcusable.
                              (beat)
                         At the time though I thought it might 
                         help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

                                     PUFF
                         When she came to work with Nathan, 
                         she seemed different, gentlemen, I 
                         don't know, somehow soulless.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Puff is in his case in formal evening wear in a makeshift 
               opera box. There is a mannequin woman sitting next to him 
               and a boom box pumping out Beethoven's Fidelio. Puff seems 
               attentive, refined, occasionally bringing a pair of opera 
               glasses up to his eyes, pinky extended. Outside the case, 
               Nathan and Lila look on. The opera is over. Puff stands, 
               applauds, yells "Bravo", and tosses a rose in the direction 
               of the imaginary stage. The rose hits the Lucite wall and 
               falls to the floor. Nathan and Lila stand and applaud Puff.

                                     NATHAN
                         Bravo to you, Puff!

                                     LILA
                         That was wonderful!

               Puff smiles and performs a foppish bow, almost a curtsy. He 
               picks up the rose, sniffs it, dramatically savoring its scent.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILA AND NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Nathan and Gabrielle are having sex. They are focused and 
               intent, although Gabrielle keeps chatting.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You were wonderful today, darling. 
                         Such authority with the ape-man boy. 
                         It made me so hot for you.

                                     NATHAN
                         Unnhh.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         The way you are taming him, it sends 
                         chills down my girlish spine and... 
                         everywhere else, too.

                                     NATHAN
                         Urgh.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Take me, darling! Tame your little 
                         monkey of love!

               There is a mutual climax. A moment of silence, then a spent 
               Nathan rolls off onto his side of the bed. We see that it is 
               really Lila in bed with him, not Gabrielle.

                                     LILA
                              (sighing)
                         Well, I'm tamed, Dr. Bronfman.

               Nathan stares up at the ceiling.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm glad... my assistant.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               We see a montage of interactions between Nathan, Puff, and 
               Lila.

               1) Nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine: sniffing 
               the cork, swishing the wine around in the glass, sipping, 
               nodding in the affirmative to the waiter. Puff, inside his 
               case, imitates it perfectly.

               2) Nathan shows Puff a flashcard which reads: "I'll start 
               tonight with the foie gras."

               3) Puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose 
               hairs. Lila applauds.

               4) Puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle.

               5) Puff, dressed as Peter Pan, stands with legs spread and 
               hands on hips. He is singing "I Gotta Crow."

               6) Puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a 
               salad. There are two types of vinegar to choose from. He 
               hesitates, then chooses the balsamic. Nathan and Lila applaud.

               7) Puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting 
               in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping 
               dog, and reading a book of poems by Yeats. Lila and Nathan, 
               outside the case, applaud and embrace.

                                     NATHAN
                         I think he's ready.

                                     LILA
                         Oh boy!

                                     PUFF
                              (jumping up)
                         Oh boy!

                                     NATHAN
                         Now, Puff, we're leaving on the 
                         electronic collar. I don't think 
                         we'll need to shock you, but just in 
                         case.

                                     PUFF
                         Okay. That's fair.

               Nathan unlocks the case. Puff tentatively steps out into the 
               world. He hugs Nathan. It's a grateful, obsequious, slightly 
               pathetic hug. Nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at 
               a distance. Puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still 
               rests his hands on Nathan's shoulders and looks him in the 
               eye, almost like a lover. Then he parts with Nathan and goes 
               over to embrace Lila. She graciously receives him. After a 
               moment in the embrace, Puff starts dry-humping Lila. Lila 
               can't get out of his clutches.

                                     NATHAN
                         No, Puff! Bad!

               Nathan presses a button, which shocks Puff and sends him 
               flying. Puff appears disoriented, then gets up off the floor, 
               brushes himself off, and turns to Lila with a bow of his 
               head.

                                     PUFF
                         My apologies, madam.

                                     LILA
                         It's okay, Puff.

                                     PUFF
                         Shan't happen again.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

               Lila, Nathan, and Puff walk along. Puff is astounded by 
               everything he sees. He looks with wonderment at the tall 
               buildings, the cars, the many different types of people. He 
               looks like an idiot.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

               Puff, Lila, and Nathan are eating lunch. Everything is very 
               proper. Puff is doing wonderfully.

                                     NATHAN
                         This is great, Puff. You're doing 
                         fine.

                                     PUFF
                         I'm loving this. It's such a treat 
                         to be out and about. What a wonderful 
                         invention a city is. The immense 
                         buildings of glass and steel glinting 
                         in the afternoon sun, the smartly 
                         dressed women in their best summer 
                         frocks, the colorful street vendors.

               The waitress comes by.

                                     WAITRESS
                         How is everything?

                                     PUFF
                         Just spectacular. Great salmon. 
                         Fantastico! You've got to give me 
                         the recipe! My compliments to the 
                         chef!

                                     WAITRESS
                         I'm glad you...

               Puff stands and grabs her and starts humping her.

                                     NATHAN
                         Puff, no!

               Nathan presses a button on a small black box. Puff falls to 
               the floor. The waitress looks on, sort of confused.

                                     WAITRESS
                         And will that be all today?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TAXI - DAY

               Lila, Nathan, and Puff are in the back seat of the moving 
               taxi.

                                     PUFF
                         It shan't happen again. I swear it. 
                         I'm just getting my sea legs, you 
                         know.

                                     LILA
                              (patting Puff on the 
                              back)
                         It's an animal urge, Puff. It's 
                         nothing to be ashamed of.

                                     NATHAN
                         Lila! Tell him.

               Lila looks at Nathan, amends her statement.

                                     LILA
                              (to Puff)
                         You just have to control it. We're 
                         not apes.

                                     NATHAN
                         Thank you very much for that.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Puff is sitting in a chair and facing a screen. The collar 
               is around his neck. Nathan and Lila stand behind him at a 
               slide projector.

                                     PUFF
                         I don't think this aversion therapy 
                         is really necessary, doctor. I 
                         understand the problem.

                                     NATHAN
                         Humor me, Puff. It's essential that 
                         I am able to trust you to function 
                         independently in the world.

                                     PUFF
                         I bow to your expertise in these 
                         matters.

                                     NATHAN
                         Lila?

               Lila dims the lights and switches on the projector. An image 
               of a pretty, fully clothed woman appears on the screen. Puff's 
               eyes widen, but he remains seated.

                                     NATHAN
                         Good. You're doing fine.

               The slide changes to a naked woman standing in a neutral 
               position, no expression on her face. Puff twitches, but stays 
               seated.

                                     NATHAN
                         Excellent.

               The slide changes to another photo of the same woman in the 
               same position, but with a seductive smile on her face. Puff 
               clutches the arms of the chairs.

                                     NATHAN
                         You're doing very nicely, Puff. I'm 
                         pleased.

               The slide changes to another picture of the same woman, this 
               time she is naked, has her back to the camera, is sticking 
               her butt out, and looking over her shoulder at the viewer 
               with shiny, heavily lipsticked, pursed lips. Puff is shaking.

                                     NATHAN
                         Great...

               Puff leaps out of his chair screaming and lunges for the 
               screen. Nathan grabs the black box and jolts him. Puff goes 
               flying in the air and lands with a crack. He heaves for a 
               while, then leaps up and runs for the screen again.

               Again Nathan shocks him. Again he lands on the floor. He 
               heaves, stands, lunges for the screen again. Nathan shocks 
               him. This happens seven more times. Smoke is pouring out 
               from the collar. Puff struggles to his feet. Looks at the 
               screen. He shrugs.

                                     PUFF
                              (unimpressed)
                         Eh.

               Puff sits down in his chair, and studies his finger nails.

               Nathan switches off the projector.

                                     NATHAN
                         Excellent work, Puff. Extra desert 
                         tonight.

                                     PUFF

                         Tomorrow, the acid test.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RESTAURANT - DAY

               This is a Hooters-type establishment called "Chester's."

               The waitresses are very busty and in Tight t-shirts which 
               are emblazoned with the name of the restaurant. Lila, Nathan, 
               and Puff sit at a table. Puff studies his menu intently, not 
               daring to look up. Lila looks around uncomfortably. A waitress 
               approaches.

                                     CHESTER'S WAITRESS
                         How you all doin' today?

                                     NATHAN
                              (cheerily)
                         Very well.

                              (awkwardly)
                         Very well.

                                     PUFF
                              (looking down)
                         Very well.

                                     CHESTER'S WAITRESS
                         Good enough! What can I get for you?

                                     NATHAN
                         Puff, why don't you order first?

                                     PUFF
                              (looking at menu)
                         Uh, what's a Reuben, please?

               The waitress leans over to study the menu. Her breasts are 
               in Puff's face.

                                     CHESTER'S WAITRESS
                         The what, honey? Oh, the Reuben? 
                         That's a sandwich with corned beef 
                         and sauer...

                                     PUFF
                         That's fine. That's what I'll have. 
                         Corned beef is a good food.

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         Puff, I'm proud of you! You did 
                         remarkably well under difficult 
                         circumstances.

                                     LILA
                         Absolutely!

               Puff jumps up and down excitedly.

                                     PUFF
                         Did I? I tried so hard! I really 
                         concentrated! Oh, I'm so happy!

                         And because you did so well, we have 
                         a little surprise for you.

                                     PUFF
                              (happily)

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Lila, Nathan, and Puff enter. Puff sees his Lucite case.

               It has been transformed into a bachelor pad. Inside is a 
               king-size bed, a TV, a couch, coffee table, shelves lined 
               with books, a small kitchenette. There is a curtain which 
               can be drawn for privacy. Puff is taken aback.

                                     NATHAN AND LILA
                         Surprise!

               Puff gasps and runs into the room. He is thrilled. Nathan 
               holds up a key.

                                     NATHAN
                         Free to come and go as you please. 
                         There's some "mad money" in the night 
                         table drawer.

                                     PUFF
                              (taking the key, 
                              hugging Nathan)
                         It's wonderful! Do you think I'm 
                         ready? Do you really?

                                     NATHAN
                         I trust that you'll make good, mature 
                         decisions. I trust that you'll do 
                         the proper thing.

                                     PUFF
                         Oh, I will!
                              (gravely)
                         Your very trust has instilled an 
                         enormous sense of responsibility in 
                         me. I don't want to disappoint you.

                                     NATHAN
                         Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't 
                         ever do what you really want to do.

                                     PUFF
                              (taking it in)
                         Got it.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILA AND NATHAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Lila and Nathan sit as far as possible from each other and 
               read books. Nathan looks at his watch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. PUFF'S CASE - NIGHT

               Puff, dressed identically to Nathan, reads Moby Dick and 
               smokes a pipe. He distractedly taps his foot, stands and 
               studies a Monet print on the wall. His foot is still nervously 
               tapping. He checks his watch.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILA AND NATHAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

               Nathan stands.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm going to go down and check on 
                         Puff. See how he's holding up.

                                     LILA
                              (stretching)
                         Should I come with?

                                     NATHAN
                         Nah. You just relax. How's the book?

                                     LILA
                              (lazily, happily)
                         Ummm. It's good.

               Nathan kisses Lila on the forehead.

                                     NATHAN
                         I won't be long.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - NIGHT

               Nathan drives with a determined look on his face.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               The apartment is a mess. Every single light is on.

               Gabrielle is lounging in a stained nightshirt with a dopey 
               cartoon bear on the front. She's got some sort of pimple 
               medication dabbed on her face. She unconsciously but 
               ferociously bites her nails as she watches TV and talks on 
               the phone. There is no trace of a French accent.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (into phone)
                         You're kidding! Holy shit.
                              (beat)
                         Yeah, no duh! I had a wild hair up 
                         my ass over that for a month.

               There's a knock at the door.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Yeah? What?

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         Hi. It's Nathan.

               Gabrielle's eyes widen. She jumps up from the couch and starts 
               straightening.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (into phone)
                         Call you back.
                              (hangs up, assumes 
                              French accent)
                         You bastard! What do you want?

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         I just want to talk.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (ripping off her 
                              nightshirt)
                         We have nothing to say! You are a 
                         rotten bastard, that's what!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               Nathan stands there leaning against the door.

                                     NATHAN
                         Please. Just one minute of your time.

                                     GABRIELLE (O.S.)
                         Why? You've made your decision, Mister 
                         Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, 
                         I don't hate you; I don't even think 
                         about you!

                                     NATHAN
                         I've got some things to tell you.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               Gabrielle is standing in front of a mirror, holding different 
               sexy outfits up to herself, trying to decide.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Like what?

                                     NATHAN (O.S.)
                         Well, I think it would be easier if 
                         I could talk to you in person.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         What for?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

               We hear banging and rustling and arranging coming from inside 
               the apartment.

                                     NATHAN
                         Well, I think...

                                     GABRIELLE (O.S.)
                         You think too much. I need a man who 
                         doesn't think so much but acts more 
                         than he thinks... is what I need!

                                     NATHAN
                         What?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You heard me! You make me sick when 
                         you pretend to not understand what I 
                         am saying to you! Go away from here!

                                     NATHAN
                              (turning away)
                         Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered 
                         you.

               He starts to head down the hall.

                                     GABRIELLE (O.S.)
                              (beat, then screaming)
                         All right, already! Come in if you 
                         must! The door's open, you son of a 
                         bitch!

               Nathan heads back to the apartment, tries the knob. The door's 
               open. He enters.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

               The lights are low. The place is neat. Cool jazz plays quietly 
               in the background. Candles are lit. Gabrielle is nowhere to 
               be found. Nathan takes it all in. It's quite seductive.

                                     GABRIELLE (O.S.)
                         In here, you lousy piece of merde.

               Nathan follows her voice. He exits into the bedroom.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIELLE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

               Candles in here also. Gabrielle, now made up and in a satin 
               teddy, lounges in bed, eating cherries from a bowl. Nathan 
               just stares. She is slightly out of breath, but trying to 
               conceal it. A film of perspiration glistens on her brow.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (testy)
                         Well?

                                     NATHAN
                         God, you're beautiful.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Please. I look a mess.

                                     NATHAN
                         No. You look so beautiful.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Anyway. Come already to the point.

                                     NATHAN
                         I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I 
                         can't stop thinking about you.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         I've moved on.

                                     NATHAN
                         No!

                                     GABRIELLE
                         I've been seeing Johannsen in 
                         chemistry.

                                     NATHAN
                              (raging)
                         That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the 
                         one who gave him the idea for the 
                         combination bug spray-sun screen! 
                         Did you know that?!

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (calm, dismissive)
                         That's not how he tells it.

                                     NATHAN
                         Of course not, that Swedish thief! 
                         He's a thief of hearts!
                              (beat)
                         I love you, Gabrielle.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (dismissive)
                         Hunh.

                                     NATHAN
                         Just give me some time to let Lila 
                         down easily. She's a really nice 
                         girl and I don't want to hurt her 
                         more than is necessary.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (beat)
                         You hurt me, you know, when you made 
                         Nathan's Choice. Does that not even 
                         matter to you, you pig?

               Gabrielle cries quietly. Nathan moves closer to her. He 
               strokes her hair.

                                     NATHAN
                         Can you ever forgive me?

               Gabrielle looks up at him. Her expression is noncommittal 
               and pouty, but she grabs his arm and pulls him down on top 
               of her.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT

               Puff, dressed a bit like he's a Victorian dandy, sits in the 
               front row and watches a naked woman on stage dancing. A 
               topless cocktail waitress comes by with a fresh drink for 
               him. She takes away his empty glass. He is horribly drunk 
               and holding himself with exaggerated rigidity -- an amateur 
               drinker's attempt to look sober.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LILA AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Nathan enters. Lila sits on the couch still reading. She 
               looks up.

                                     NATHAN
                         Hey.

               Nathan kisses her on the forehead.

                                     LILA
                         You were gone a long time.

                                     NATHAN
                              (sits down next to 
                              her)
                         Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, 
                         philosophical discussion. He's really 
                         quite well read, considering he's 
                         only been literate for a month now. 
                         He's going to make us famous, Lila.

                                     LILA
                         So he's doing okay?

                                     NATHAN
                         Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying 
                         his new digs.

                                     LILA
                         That's funny because, you know, I 
                         just went and picked him up at some 
                         flophouse on the lower eastside. He 
                         called here when he ran out of his 
                         "mad" money after spending an entire 
                         evening drinking, watching strippers, 
                         and fucking a whore!
                              (then casually)
                         Oh, and what did you do tonight, 
                         honey?

                                     NATHAN
                         Shit.

                                     LILA
                         And what did you do tonight, honey?

                                     NATHAN
                         I've fallen in love with somebody 
                         else, Lila.

                                     LILA
                              (pointedly)
                         And what did you do tonight, honey?

                                     NATHAN
                         I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. 
                         I'm sorry. But that's what the hell 
                         I did.

                                     LILA
                              (standing)
                         Do you know what I gave up to be 
                         with you?

                                     NATHAN
                         Yes.

                                     LILA
                         I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I 
                         gave up my body hair!

                                     NATHAN
                         Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human 
                         heart is a strange thing.

                                     LILA
                         How the hell would you know anything 
                         about the human heart?

                                     NATHAN
                              (moving to her)
                         Lila...

               Lila turns around and slugs him, square on the jaw, hard, 
               knocking him to the floor.

                                     LILA
                         How's that for ladylike, Nathan.

               Lila opens up the hall closet and pulls out a suitcase.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               Lila looks pale and shaken. She smokes.

                                     LILA
                         For two weeks I holed myself up in a 
                         motel room. I didn't even know who I 
                         was. My world had crumbled. There is 
                         nothing that makes you feel dirtier 
                         than finally deciding to sell your 
                         soul and finding no buyers.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

               Lila lies in bed watching TV. She is a mess. The room is a 
               mess. The wig is off. There's hair sprouting on her face.

               The curtains are drawn. There is a knock at the door.

                                     LILA
                         No maid service! For God's sake, 
                         can't you read the fucking "do not 
                         disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?

                                     ROSE (O.S.)
                         Lila, it's Rosie.

                                     LILA
                              (beat)
                         Go the fuck away, Rosie.

                                     ROSE (O.S.)
                         Please, honey, let me in.

                                     LILA
                         Rose, please go away.

                                     ROSE (O.S.)
                         Lila, I want to help you.

               Lila gets up, drags herself to the door, and opens it. Rose 
               stands there trying not to let it show how lousy Lila looks.

                                     LILA
                         How'd you know where I was?

                                     ROSE
                         Nathan told my brother.

                                     LILA
                         Your brother should have his license 
                         revoked.

                                     ROSE
                         Yeah, although I'm not going to turn 
                         him in. I like hearing the dirt.

                                     LILA
                              (suddenly crying)
                         Why didn't your brother tell you 
                         that Nathan was having an affair?

               Rose holds Lila, who hangs on her as she weeps.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't know, honey. I don't know. 
                         Maybe he just didn't want to get 
                         involved.

                                     LILA
                         Oh, Rosie.

                                     ROSE
                         Let's get you out of here. Come stay 
                         with me until you get your strength 
                         back.
                              (cheerily)
                         Free electrolysis, if you want it! 
                         We'll get that face of yours cleared 
                         up in no time.

               Lila mulls it over. She looks back at the hotel room. It's 
               depressing. She sniffs in her snot.

                                     LILA
                         Yeah. I gotta get myself together. I 
                         want to look good. If I'm gonna fuck 
                         with Nathan, and I am, I want him to 
                         want to fuck me when I do it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MONTAGE SEQUENCE

               This sequence is Lila getting her strength back, both 
               emotional and physical. It is intercut with scenes of Nathan 
               and Gabrielle taking Puff on the lecture circuit.

               1) Lila eating a good breakfast.

               2) Lila struggling to do push-ups.

               3) Lila getting electrolysis on her face.

               4) Lila reading Nietzsche.

               5) Lila jogging.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               A bearded psychologist addresses a crowd of bearded 
               psychologists.

                                     BEARDED PSYCHOLOGIST
                         ...and so without further ado, I 
                         give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and 
                         Puff.

               The room bursts into applause as Nathan and Puff walk out 
               onstage, both in tuxes. Nathan stands behind a podium, Puff 
               sits casually, legs crossed, in a chair.

                                     NATHAN
                         Thank you. Let's get right to it. 
                         Here we have Puff the day of his 
                         capture.

               A video of Puff naked in his Lucite case, clawing at it, 
               shrieking like a banshee, and neurotically hopping up and 
               down, is projected onto a screen behind Nathan. There is a 
               collective gasp from the audience. Puff watches the video 
               with amused detachment. The video stops.

                                     NATHAN
                         And here he is today, a scant three 
                         months later.

               Puff stands, bows slightly to the audience. They burst into 
               vigorous applause.

                                     NATHAN
                         Puff, why don't you say a few words 
                         to the assemblage.

                                     PUFF
                         It would be my pleasure, doctor.
                              (behind podium)
                         Distinguished gentlemen and ladies 
                         of the psychological community, I 
                         stand before you today, a living 
                         testament to the amazing skill of 
                         Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he 
                         took me from crayons to perfume would 
                         be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman 
                         took me from playing with my own 
                         feces, then to crayons, and then to 
                         an appreciation of the complex works 
                         of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and 
                         Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive 
                         masturbation to...

               INT. BACKSTAGE - A BIT LATER

               Gabrielle waits in the wings.

                                     PUFF (O.S.)
                         And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we 
                         meet again, au revoir.

               The audience bursts into thunderous applause. Gabrielle joins 
               in. Nathan and Puff hurry off stage. Gabrielle embraces 
               Nathan.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         You were wonderful!

                                     NATHAN
                         Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Don't be silly!
                              (hugs Puff)
                         And you were wonderful, too! I loved 
                         the way you said " au revoir."

               Puff and Gabrielle exchange a look. She discreetly pinches 
               Puff's butt, smiles, winks. Nathan doesn't see this. He puts 
               his arm around Gabrielle.

                                     NATHAN
                         Come on, you two. Let's go celebrate!

               Nathan and Gabrielle walk on ahead. Puff tags behind, watching 
               Gabrielle's delightful walk.

               INT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER

               Puff sits up on his bed, looking dejected. He listens to the 
               sounds of Nathan and Gabrielle having sex in the adjoining 
               room. He looks at his watch, gets up, gets dressed.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. X RATED BOOKSTORE - LATER

               A sweaty, sick-looking Puff watches a porno film in a little 
               booth. It ends. He steps out into the fluorescent glare of 
               the store. He walks out past several skulking degenerates.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS

               Puff exits the bookstore, walks down the street checking out 
               the tawdry hookers. He chooses one. She leads him into a 
               dark alley.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               Puff is on stage demonstrating his ballroom dancing technique. 
               He is waltzing with Gabrielle. Nathan stops the music, and 
               picks up a microphone.

                                     NATHAN
                         Now the tango.

               Nathan puts a tango record on. Gabrielle and Puff perform 
               expertly. The audience applauds.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

               Gabrielle, Nathan, and Puff are eating dinner.

                                     NATHAN
                         I think it went swimmingly today. 
                         You two make an excellent team.

               Gabrielle and Puff look at each other. She touches Puff's 
               knee under the table. Nathan is busy eating.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ANOTHER HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

               Puff paces as he listens to sex noises from the next room.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

               Puff walks along checking out the prostitutes. He signals to 
               one with a nonchalant jerk of his head.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               15) Lila, in boxing gloves, punching a bag.

               16) Lila reading the Kama Sutra.

               17) Lila getting electrolysis.

               INT. LECTURE HALL - DAY

               Puff addresses the crowd. Lila and Nathan look on adoringly 
               from the wings.

                                     PUFF
                         To be taken from the depths of 
                         ignorance and depravity and raised 
                         to heights of culture and refinement! 
                         This is the priceless gift bestowed 
                         upon me by Dr. Nathan Bronfman.

               Thunderous applause.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. ALLEY - NIGHT

               Puff leans against the wall drinking whiskey from a bottle, 
               as a prostitute, down on her knees in front of him, does her 
               business. The look on his face is not one of pleasure or 
               even release. It is a look of decay.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MONTAGE

               18) Lila does chin ups. Her sweaty, muscular arms glisten in 
               the sun.

               19) Lila wind sprinting.

               20) Lila getting electrolysis. Rose moves away from her.

                         Done!

                              (standing triumphantly)
                         Ready!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Nathan and Gabrielle, in lab coats, sit chatting with Puff.

               Puff sneaks glances at Gabrielle's legs and cleavage. She 
               makes his viewing possible.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (off clipboard)
                         So we've got seventeen new bookings 
                         for speaking engagements, my wonderful 
                         men.

                                     NATHAN
                         Terrific. We're all going to be rich 
                         and famous.

               Nathan kisses Gabrielle.

                                     PUFF
                         Thanks to you, Nate.

                                     NATHAN
                         Thanks to you, Buddy. And your 
                         diligence and intelligence and 
                         perseverance.

               Puff blushes.

                                     NATHAN
                              (to Gabrielle)
                         And of course to you, my sweet, for 
                         your... moral support.

                                     PUFF
                              (applauding)
                         here, here.

               Gabrielle kisses Nathan while glancing at Puff. A midget in 
               a business suit enters. It's the sour-looking guy from the 
               freak show.

                                     MIDGET
                         Excuse me, are you Dr. Bronfman?

                                     PUFF
                         Is that a little boy?

                                     NATHAN
                              (teaching)
                         No, Puff. This man is a midget. In 
                         actuality, they prefer to be called 
                         "Little People." Isn't that correct, 
                         my good man?

                                     MIDGET
                         Yes sir. Little People.

                                     NATHAN
                         This Little Person is actually a 
                         fully grown adult man, Puff, believe 
                         it or not, who, due to a genetic 
                         anomaly, is miniature but perfectly 
                         proportioned.
                              (to midget)
                         Turn, please.

               The midget turns.

                                     PUFF
                              (jotting in notebook)
                         Interesting.

                                     NATHAN
                         Now, my diminutive friend, what can 
                         I do for you?

               The midget pulls out a gun.

                                     MIDGET
                         You can get into that goddamn Lucite 
                         bachelor pad for starters, Goliath.

               Nathan, Gabrielle, and Puff look frightened. They stand and 
               back into the case.

                                     MIDGET
                              (to Puff)
                         Not you, Joyboy.

               Puff stops in his tracks. Nathan and Gabrielle continue to 
               back into the case.

                                     NATHAN
                         What is this about? We have no money 
                         on these premises. Please if you are 
                         from some little person terrorist 
                         fringe group...

                                     MIDGET
                              (loud and scary)
                         Shut up!

               Nathan and Gabrielle hurry into the case. The midget closes 
               and locks the door behind them. Puff is frozen with fear.

               Lila enters. She looks different now. Savage. Strong.

               Kind of sexy. She wears guerilla-like black clothing and a 
               beret over her closely hacked-off hair. She also carries a 
               gun.

                                     NATHAN
                         Lila?

                                     GABRIELLE
                         That's Lila?

                                     LILA
                         Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. 
                         And don't let the hirsutism fool 
                         you. I know more about being a woman, 
                         and more about the black hearts of 
                         men than you, in your pretty little 
                         powdered, bullshit fantasy world, 
                         can ever imagine. I know the darkness 
                         and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.

                                     NATHAN
                         Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, 
                         do you?

                                     LILA
                         Eat shit, thumbtack dick!
                              (to Midget)
                         Thank you, Frank. You're the best.

               Lila kisses the midget on the top of the head.

                                     MIDGET
                         Anything for you, Lila.

                                     LILA
                         See, Frank and I are kindred spirits. 
                         We both know what it's like to be 
                         shunned because of our appearance. 
                         We both know how easily that turns 
                         into self-hatred.

                                     MIDGET
                         Amen. Praise the Lord and pass the 
                         ammunition!

               Rose enters hurriedly, carrying rope. She bends over and 
               kisses Frank hard on the mouth for a long moment, then:

                                     ROSE
                              (to Lila)
                         Sorry I'm late, parking is a bitch 
                         at this place.

               Lila looks over and sees the two trained mice in the Lucite 
               case sitting at a tiny table and very politely eating their 
               lunch. One of the mice makes eye contact with Lila.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

               Lila is naked in the bathroom and about to kill herself when 
               she makes eye contact with the mouse on the shelf next to 
               the tub.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. LAB - DAY

               Lila brings her focus back to the room. Everyone is watching 
               her, waiting for some direction.

                                     LILA
                         Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.

                                     ROSE
                         With pleasure.

               Frank keeps the gun on Gabrielle and Nathan. Rose enters the 
               case and begins to tie them up and gag them.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

               Puff is sitting in the car. The electronic collar is back 
               around his neck. Lila holds the black control box, and the 
               Lucite case with the two mice in it. She stands outside the 
               car with Frank and Rose.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm going to miss you.

                                     LILA
                         Oh, Rosie.

                                     ROSE
                         And I'm going to miss the lifestyle 
                         having you as a client has afforded 
                         me.

                                     LILA
                         Shut up, you.

               Lila laughs and hugs her.

                                     ROSE
                         I like you so much, with or without 
                         hair.
                              (confidentially)
                         But don't spread that around. Bad 
                         for business.

                                     LILA
                         I'm really glad you two found each 
                         other.

               Frank and Rose put their arms around each other. Frank is 
               exactly crotch-high to Rose.

                                     MIDGET
                         We're soul mates.

                                     ROSE
                         Souls have nothing to do with it, 
                         babe.

                                     LILA
                         I'll be in touch.

                                     ROSE
                         No you won't. But it's okay. You 
                         have stuff you gotta do.

               Lila tears up. So does Rose. They just stand there for a 
               moment, then:

                                     LILA
                              (choked)
                         Gotta go.

               Lila hurries around the car, gets in, and drives off. Rose 
               and Frank embrace. Frank nestles. Rose sighs contentedly.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON

               Lila's car drives along. Puff looks nervously out the window.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - EVENING

               Lila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through 
               the woods. Lila pulls off the road, drives to a place where 
               the car will be camouflaged, and parks.

                                     LILA
                         Stay.

               Puff stays in the car. Lila gets out, pulls the Lucite mouse 
               case from the back seat.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               Lila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it. The mice 
               looks confused at first. Then the male mouse pushes the door 
               open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male 
               mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns 
               to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to 
               hold on to. She does, and they walk off together on their 
               hind legs into the woods. Lila sighs, and turns to Puff.

                                     LILA
                         Out.

               Puff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road.

               Lila calmly presses the button on her black box. Puff spasms 
               and falls to the ground.

                                     LILA
                         Bad.

               Puff stays on the ground, breathing hard.

                                     LILA
                         Get up.

               Puff does.

                                     LILA
                         Take off your clothes.

               Puff does. So does Lila. She is covered with hair, except 
               for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, 
               Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the 
               way both of them were when they first met.

               Puff seems taken with her body.

                                     LILA
                         We're going back to nature, you and 
                         I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm 
                         going to make you free again if I 
                         have to kill you doing it.

                                     PUFF
                         But I like being human now.

               Lila shocks Puff. He falls to the ground.

                                     LILA
                         You what?

                                     PUFF
                         I want to be the way I was before.

                                     LILA
                              (sweet)
                         Good. I'll show you how, apey.

               EXT. WOODS - A BIT LATER

               Puff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and 
               twigs. They are sitting around a campfire, naked and dirty, 
               roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks. The black 
               box rests in Lila's lap. Puff looks at the roasting squirrel, 
               is repulsed.

                                     PUFF
                         Nice night.

                                     LILA
                         Talking is to be kept to a minimum. 
                         Eventually, when we are ready, there 
                         will be none. Language was invented 
                         so that people could lie to each 
                         other and to themselves. There is no 
                         other reason.

               Puff begins to disagree. Lila's hand hovers over the button. 
               He stops himself.

                                     PUFF
                              (confused)
                         I agree?

               Lila shocks Puff.

                                     LILA
                         You lose. Any answer is the wrong 
                         answer.

               INT. MAKESHIFT SHELTER - NIGHT

               Puff and Lila lie seperately under blankets of moss. The 
               breathing is heavy. Both seem to be sleeping. Puff opens his 
               eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without 
               making any noise. Lila presses the button and Puff falls in 
               a quivering mess.

                                     LILA
                              (whisper)
                         You'll thank me eventually, Puff. 
                         Well, you won't thank me, because we 
                         won't be speaking, but you'll sort 
                         of thank me with a special look, the 
                         look a dog gives you to let you know 
                         he loves you.

                                     PUFF
                         What an enchanting picture you paint 
                         of our future together.

               Lila shocks Puff once again. As he spasms, we:

                         And so commenced my reeducation, 
                         gentlemen. Lila taught me so much. 
                         She was a stern but fair teacher. 
                         And over time, I began to remember 
                         the carefree joy of living in a pure 
                         state of being. But something else 
                         happened as well, something perhaps 
                         distinctly human... I began to fall 
                         in love with Lila.

               EXT. WOODS - DAY

               Lila and Puff are naked and collecting mushrooms and berries. 
               Time has passed. Both Lila and Puff are dirtier and hairier. 
               Puff still wears his collar. Lila bends over to pick a 
               mushroom. Puff looks at her from behind.

                                     PUFF
                         Boy, you look so good from this ang...

               Lila turns, puts her finger to her lips in a gentle "no 
               talking" reminder, then shocks the hell out of Puff. He spasms 
               and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground.

               He regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila.

               They look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a 
               violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now. 
               In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the 
               shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in 
               this context.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

               Nathan and Gabrielle are in bed, making love. It is gentle, 
               romantic, in good taste -- in direct contrast to the animal, 
               violent sex Puff and Lila are having. They finish. Nathan 
               pulls himself off of Gabrielle and falls onto his back, 
               staring up at the ceiling.

                                     GABRIELLE

               Nathan's parents are in clown make-up. There is a long 
               silence. Nathan is still sad. Gabrielle steals glances at 
               Nathan's parents. Finally Nathan speaks.

                         I know. And that's great. But it 
                         would be great in a better way, not 
                         a better way but a different way, if

                         I have some thoughts. I think that 
                         hairy bitch is somewhere trying to 
                         turn him back into an ape.

                         That is horrible. Apes are dirty. 
                         No?

                                     NATHAN
                         You better believe they're dirty! 
                         And smelly! And messy! And they don't 
                         know their forks from their assholes!

               Nathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine, 
               scrunches his face and holds his ears. He relaxes a bit, and 
               gets out of bed. He walks across the room, pulls on some 
               pants, and picks up a container called "Stop Buggin' Me, 
               Sunny."

                         I'm going alone. This could be 
                         dangerous.

                              (yelling)
                         Aha!

               He looks around there is no one there. He sighs and walks 
               back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a 
               red X.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MOTEL - NIGHT

               Nathan is in his underwear. He is ironing his safari suit as 
               he talks on the phone.

                                     NATHAN
                         No luck yet, my sweet.

               We see an unfolded map on the bed. There are red X's in almost 
               all the state parks along the east coast.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FOREST - EVENING

               Lila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now 
               Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed 
               shocks. They giggle and kiss after they finish. Puff sits 
               up. He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily. Lila grunts 
               back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries.

               Puff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces.

               Lila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face. 
               She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then 
               grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty 
               soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple 
               stains. They hug each other, out of breath and laughing.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               Lila smiles.

                                     LILA
                         It was paradise.
                              (beat, sadly)
                         At least for a tiny little while.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Lila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the 
               midday sun. There is a rustling in the bushes. They both 
               look up, alert but calm. Nathan, immaculate in his safari 
               suit, appears in the clearing. He holds a gun.

                                     NATHAN
                         Aha! Finally. I've covered almost 
                         the entire seaboard and parts of 
                         eastern Ohio.

                                     LILA
                         Ugnh.

                                     PUFF
                         Ugnh.

                                     NATHAN
                         Oh please, is that as articulate as 
                         you can be after all the time I spent 
                         teaching you? We've discussed 
                         Wittgenstein, for Christ's sake. Not 
                         that you ever had anything very 
                         original or challenging to say on 
                         the subject.

                                     PUFF
                         Unn.

                                     NATHAN
                         Down from the tree. Both of you. 
                         Keep your hands where I can see them. 
                         Don't want you pulling any weapons 
                         out of your fur.

               Nathan laughs heartily, haughtily, at his joke as Lila and 
               Puff climb down from the tree.

                                     NATHAN
                         Look at you two. You both disgust 
                         me.

                                     LILA
                         Oook. Oook.

                                     NATHAN
                         Shut up!
                              (to Puff)
                         I gave you... life. I created you in 
                         my image, Puff. I took you from this 
                         primordial ooze and brought you into 
                         the world of culture and art and 
                         manners. And this is how you repay 
                         me? By heading back to the ooze first 
                         chance you get? I should leave you 
                         here with Lila the ape woman. It 
                         would serve you right, you ungrateful 
                         piece of crap. But I'm not going to. 
                         You're too valuable to me. Totally 
                         selfish of me. You serve my purpose. 
                         But if you had any smarts you would 
                         realize that I serve your purpose as 
                         well. Life is so much more delightful 
                         when lived in a silk suit.

                                     LILA
                         Ooka.

                                     NATHAN
                         Don't worry, Lila. You can stay. I 
                         don't have any interest in you 
                         anymore.
                              (to Puff)
                         C'mon, monkey boy.

               Puff looks at Lila. Lila shrugs helplessly. Puff reaches out 
               to touch her hand.

                                     NATHAN
                         Now!

               Puff looks at Lila again. She jerks her head in the direction 
               of Nathan. Puff sighs and moves to Nathan.

               Nathan prods Puff, and they head off through the trees.

               Suddenly Puff elbows Nathan. Nathan grunts, doubles over.

               Puff turns, lunges, and the two wrestle on the ground.

               Puff pries the gun from Nathan's hand, and jumps up. Nathan 
               stands also, backing away. Puff has the gun trained on Nathan. 
               Lila runs to Puff, stands behind him.

                                     NATHAN
                         Puff, put the gun down.

                                     PUFF
                         Ounpoo. Ungh.

                                     NATHAN
                         Let's be reasonable human beings 
                         here. We're all reasonable human 
                         beings, aren't we?

                                     PUFF
                              (jumping up and down 
                              like a chimp)
                         Unka unka unka unka unka.

                                     NATHAN
                         Look, why don't you and Lila stay 
                         here and have your natural life. 
                         I'll just go on my way. You'll never 
                         see me again.

                                     PUFF
                              (to Lila, guiltily)
                         I have to talk. Is that okay?

               Lila nods.

                                     PUFF
                              (to Nathan)
                         You did create me in your image, 
                         Nathan. Before you I was a simple, 
                         happy, complete being, in harmony 
                         with the world around me. After you 
                         I became duplicitous, cynical, angry, 
                         anal, totally out of touch with my 
                         surroundings. In a word, Nathan, I 
                         became you. Lila has reintroduced me 
                         to myself. And, incidentally, what 
                         I'm about to do, kill you, is 
                         something that would never have 
                         occurred to me to do as a creature 
                         of the Earth. Before when I killed, 
                         it was for food or in self-defense. 
                         Now I will kill for revenge. Revenge 
                         is an abstract concept, Nathan. And 
                         I learned abstract thinking from 
                         you.

                                     NATHAN
                         No.

                                     LILA
                         Puff, don't.

               Puff shoots. A crow screams. The fluttering of wings. The 
               bullet hits Nathan in the head. He falls.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

               Lila sobs.

                                     LILA
                         Then I shot Nathan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY

               Puff dabs his eye.

                                     PUFF
                         Then Lila shot Nathan.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY

               Nathan talks.

                                     NATHAN
                         Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's 
                         all I know. That's the end of my 
                         story. Do I get to go to heaven now?
                              (beat)
                         Or is it... hell?
                              (beat)
                         Or... what?
                              (beat)
                         I just stay here, is it? I just stay 
                         here and tell it again? And after 
                         that? Again? And after...
                              (sighs)
                         Yes. Yes, of course.
                              (sighs, clears his 
                              throat)

               We move into an extreme close-up.

                                     NATHAN
                              (beginning again)
                         I don't even know what sorry means 
                         anymore. It's odd. When I was alive 
                         I knew -- maybe it was all I knew...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. FOREST - DAY

               Lila runs to Nathan. She kneels beside him.

                                     LILA
                         He's dead.

                                     PUFF
                              (calmly)
                         We bury the body. We disappear into 
                         the woods. Nobody knows.

                                     LILA
                              (beat, then quietly)
                         No. This is the end of the road. 
                         There's a dead human being here. For 
                         all of his faults, he was a human 
                         being, and certainly a victim of his 
                         culture as much as anybody.

                                     PUFF
                         Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. 
                         We'll never talk about it again. 
                         We'll never talk again period. I 
                         love you.

                                     LILA
                         Puff, what happened to you is as 
                         much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe 
                         more so, because I knew it was wrong 
                         and I went along with it anyway. I'm 
                         taking responsibility for the murder. 
                         I want you to go back to your old 
                         life.

                                     PUFF
                         I won't let you do that. I shot the 
                         bastard. And I'm glad.

                                     LILA
                         No. Go back to the woods. This is a 
                         sacrifice I need to make. In my world 
                         we have something called penance. 
                         It's another abstraction, but I had 
                         the concept drummed into my head 
                         during my years in the convent. It 
                         doesn't exist for you, and it 
                         shouldn't. See, I could never be 
                         free again anyway, so I might as 
                         well be in jail.

                         Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. 
                         I'll be the most free, truest animal 
                         in the whole forest. For both of us.

                                     LILA
                              (tearing up)
                         That's what I'm counting on.

                              (an idea)
                         But first I'll live among them, just 
                         long enough to testify before congress 
                         about the waywardness of humankind.

                                     LILA
                              (shrugs)
                         Okay. If you think it will help.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. JAIL - DAY

               Lila, now in prison coveralls, sits in a dayroom with other 
               women convicts. She is watching a TV mounted on the wall.

               Puff is testifying.

                                     PUFF
                         And so, gentlemen, that is my story. 
                         I agreed to testify before this 
                         committee because I hoped to convey 
                         to the American public that there is 
                         indeed a paradise lost. Human beings 
                         have become so enamored of their 
                         technologies and their intellectual 
                         prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, 
                         that they've forgotten to look to 
                         the Earth as a teacher. This is 
                         hubris, my friends. And my story of 
                         destruction and betrayal is proof of 
                         that. I will keep my promise to Lila. 
                         I will shed this suit and go back 
                         into the wilderness. I will live out 
                         my days naked and free.

                                     CONGRESSMAN
                         Thank you, sir. Your story has touched 
                         us all deeply. We will pass some 
                         legislation addressing this problem.

                                     PUFF
                         Thank you. That is all I ask.
                              (to camera)
                         Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me 
                         in my untamed heart.

               Puff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash.

               In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye.

               She seems genuinely happy. She looks out a small barred window 
               and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY

               Puff walks along, a man on a mission. As he walks he sheds 
               articles of clothing. He is followed by reporters and 
               cameramen and celebrity hounds. Soon he is naked.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY

               Puff walks along, naked. People cheer from porches.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK

               Puff walks along. He is still followed by reporters. Cows 
               watch the parade.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. FOREST - EVENING

               Puff walks along a dirt road. He is about to disappear into 
               the forest. An older woman rushes out from the crowd.

                                     OLDER WOMAN
                         Wait!

                                     PUFF
                              (turning)
                         Yes?

                                     OLDER WOMAN
                         I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking 
                         for you for thirty years. Then there 
                         you were, such a beautiful, beautiful 
                         grown man.

               The older woman starts to cry.

                                     PUFF
                         Mother?

                                     OLDER WOMAN
                         Yes... Derek.

               Puff holds out his hand for her to shake. Flashbulbs flash.

                                     PUFF
                              (formally)
                         It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. 
                         But I'm an ape like dad was...
                              (checks watch)
                         And I have to go back into the woods 
                         now... forever.

                                     OLDER WOMAN
                              (resigned)
                         Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew 
                         that was going to be what you would 
                         say. It's good to see you again 
                         though.

                                     PUFF
                         Yes.

                                     OLDER WOMAN
                         I'm in the book, if you ever want to 
                         drop me a line or something.

                                     PUFF
                         I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And 
                         apes don't drop lines.

               His mother weeps. Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder 
               for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters. The 
               crowd bursts into applause. Flashbulbs flash. Puff jogs into 
               the woods. There is a collective sigh, and then everyone 
               turns and heads back in the direction from which they came. 
               We hold on the woods for a moment. A car pulls up. Puff 
               hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of 
               the car.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS

               Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle, who is driving the 
               car.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Hello, my little boy.

                                     PUFF
                         Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? 
                         I'm freezing my ass off.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like 
                         you asked.

                                     PUFF
                         Great.
                              (putting on suit)
                         God, I've wanted you forever.

               Gabrielle giggles. Puff kisses her.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         Say my name.

                                     PUFF
                         Gabrielle.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (eyes glistening)
                         You remind me so much of Nathan.

                                     PUFF
                         Like father, like son.

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (stroking his face)
                         You remind me so much of Nathan plus 
                         so much of my little mongrel doggie.

                                     PUFF
                         Woof.

               This turns Gabrielle on. She kisses him passionately. When 
               the kiss runs its course, Puff speaks.

                                     PUFF
                         Arf.

               Gabrielle kisses him again, even more passionately this time

                                     PUFF
                         As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not 
                         sorry she killed him, if it means I 
                         can have you. Is that a terrible 
                         thing to say, my sweet?

                                     GABRIELLE
                              (putting her finger 
                              to his lips)
                         Hush. No, it is never terrible to be 
                         in love. Nathan's memory lives on in 
                         our sacred union.
                              (beat)
                         I'm not sorry she killed him either. 
                         Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite 
                         and sophisticated and charming. You 
                         are all that, too. But you have 
                         something more. You have a bit of 
                         the animal in you.

               They smile flirtatiously at each other. Puff leans over and 
               kisses Gabrielle's neck.

                                     PUFF
                         Let's go eat, I'm starved.

                                     GABRIELLE
                         French?

                                     PUFF
                         Oui.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

               The car makes a screeching u-turn. It disappears in the 
               direction of the city. When the dust clears, we see the two 
               white mice standing there on the side of the road, shivering 
               and emaciated. The male holds out his the thumb and the female 
               holds a tiny little sign which reads: New York.

               There is a look of hopelessness in their beady black eyes.

               FADE OUT.

                                         THE END

2   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY    2

    Startled, STEVEN RUSSELL (40) opens his eyes. Gaunt and
    pale, he seems to be on death's door. The whine we once
    heard is now the high-pitched ALARM of medical equipment.

    The door BURSTS open. NURSES enter, rushing toward him.

    The nurses pass him and attend to the PATIENT in the next
    bed over, frantically administering CPR.

    SUPER: "TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY INFIRMARY - 1998"

    A DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside.

                           DOCTOR
              Where's the crash cart!?

    He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
    the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.

    Steven returns his gaze to the ceiling. A CHEERY VOICE
    counterpoints the bleakness of this scene.

                           STEVEN (V.O.)
                     (upbeat and happy)
              Love sure is a funny thing...
              It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes
              you do all sorts of things you never
              thought you'd do before. Love's the
              reason I'm here actually.

3   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              3

    A group of FOUR NINE YEAR OLDS lie in the grass atop a
    hill. They stare up at the clouds, playfully arguing.

                           RED HAIRED BOY
              I still don't see it.

                           LITTLE GIRL
              It's right there.

    A young STEVEN RUSSELL (9) is among them.

                           YOUNG STEVEN
              It's really big.

                           STEVEN'S MOM (O.S.)

    Steven looks down the hill to see his mother calling.

4   INT. LIVING ROOM CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              4

    Young Steven sits in the middle of the couch. His PARENTS
    and 11 year old BROTHER stand before him. He stares at
    them- innocent and doe-eyed with a big smile on his face.

                           STEVEN'S MOM
              Are you a happy little boy Steven?

    Steven smiles and nods.

                            STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
              You've always been such a happy little
              boy.
                     (then)
              Now Steven, we want to tell you something
              very important, but I want you to
              understand that it doesn't change a
              thing.

    Steven awaits, smiling.

                           STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
              We're still gonna love you, you're still
              gonna be our happy little boy and you're
              still gonna--

                           STEVEN'S BROTHER
              You're adopted.

                       YOUNG STEVEN
          Shut up!

He glares at his brother, then turns back to his mother.
Her face says it all.

                       STEVEN'S MOM
          It's true.

WHACK! She SWATS his brother in the head. Steven starts
putting things together.

                        STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D)
          Your brother overheard your Dad and I
          talking and well, we didn't want you to
          hear it from anybody but us.
                 (then)
          It's true. You're a special little boy.
          You know why? Because we chose you. Not
          like your brother here who's natural.

                       STEVEN'S DAD
          Your Mother's right. It's cause we love
          you. So we put some money in a brown
          paper bag and gave it to your real mom in
          the hospital parking lot so you could
          come home with us. Okay?

                       STEVEN'S MOM
          It doesn't change a thing honey. We love
          you just as much as we love your brother
          here...
                 (best of intentions)
          ...and he's natural.

                       STEVEN'S DAD
          So son, are you okay?

Steven smiles wide.

                       YOUNG STEVEN
          Yes Daddy.

As his parents prattle on, Steven's VO comes full.

                       STEVEN (V.O.)
          It hurt a bit, but I decided I wasn't
          gonna let it get me down. No way. I was
          gonna be the best son- No, the best
          person I could be.

5    I/E. VIRGINIA BEACH CHURCH OF GOD - 1984 - DAY                  5

     A joyous Sunday. OPEN ON the LETTER BOARD of THE VIRGINIA
     BEACH CHURCH OF GOD. The date reads, MARCH 1984.

     A congregation packs the church to the rafters as a
     Lawrence Welk-ish CHOIR praises Jesus to the tune of
     Hallelujah! We Shall Rise.

     Amidst this white-man's paradise sits a smiling and
     healthy STEVEN- playing the organ with a happy-stick
     planted firmly up his ass.

     As the joyous flock whoops it up, Steven winks to his
     wife (DEBBIE) and their 4 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER (STEPHANIE)
     who sit in the first row.

     Steven, oblivious, hits a sour note or two-- but keeps on
     playing with happy abandon. The crowd continues to enjoy
     the inspiring hymn.


6    I/E. VIRGINIA BEACH POLICE STATION FRONT DESK, 1984 - DAY 6

     A police receptionist (MANDI) at a switchboard in a small-
     town police station answers the phone.

                            MANDI
               Virginia Beach Police Department, how may
               I direct your call?

     Steven enters in UNIFORM, smiling wide. Mandi waves
     happily. She covers the receiver and whispers.

                            MANDI (CONT'D)
               Something came for you.

     As he nods and moves on he's greeted by a VARIOUS
     POLICEMEN. We can tell he's well liked.

                             STEVEN
               Hey fellas.

                            VARIOUS POLICEMAN
               Hey Steve, Steve, mornin', etc...

     Steven arrives at his desk to find a large FILE BOX. He
     turns it around to reveal writing on the side. It reads,
     "BASHAM, BRENDA"

7   INT. STEPHANIE'S BEDROOM (VIRGINIA, 1984) - NIGHT             7

    Steven switches off the small lamp beside Stephanie's
    bed. He kisses her forehead.

                           STEVEN
              Have lots of dreams...

                            STEPHANIE
                      (smiling)
              Okay.


8   INT. STEVEN AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM (VIRGINIA, 1984) - NIGHT 8

    Steven and Debbie kneel at the edge of the bed, praying.

                           DEBBIE
              ...and if it wasn't for you Jesus, I
              would have never found that last coffee
              filter and Prayer-Girls would have been
              ruined. So thank you for that.

                            STEVEN
              Amen.

    Steven moves to get up but settles back in when she
    continues.

                           DEBBIE
              And thank you for Steffie's allergy
              screen coming back all negative. I always
              knew it was in your plan for her to enjoy
              nuts. And finally I want to thank you
              for this man Jesus. This man who works
              so hard to make us happy without even a
              thought for himself.

    Steven smiles at that sentiment. Again he moves to get up
    when--

                           DEBBIE (CONT'D)
              This man who pursued me to the ends of
              the Earth and promised me a life of
              eternal happiness. A promise he has kept
              oh Lord. Every day. Amen.

                            STEVEN
              Amen.

    Steven tries to get up again. Then-
    "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   6.


                           DEBBIE
              Sometimes when I think of how happy I am,
              I just want to cry. Like the time when
              you--

                           STEVEN
                     (politely)
              Okay let's wrap it up...

                           DEBBIE
              And in your gracious name, I find thee
              and praise thee. Amen.

                           STEVEN
              Amen.

                                                       CUT TO:


9   INT. STEVEN AND DEBBIE'S BEDROOM 1984 - NIGHT - LATER        9

    CLICK. In bed with Debbie, Steven switches off the light
    and lets out a hearty YAWN.

                           STEVEN
              I'm absolutely bushed.

                           DEBBIE
              Me too.

    They turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. After
    a few moments of SILENCE, Steven rolls over and puts his
    arm around her, gently feeling her breasts.

    Debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as Steven
    quietly gets on top. In moments, they are rocking with
    the gentle rhythm of everyday sex.

    Just as things are peaking, Steven suddenly STOPS and
    strikes a conversational tone.

                           STEVEN
              Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots
              of access? You know- records and things?

                           DEBBIE
                     (surprised)
              Steven-

                           STEVEN
                     (oblivious)
              Now do you think it's, you know,
              unethical, to use that to find my mother?
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages    5-23-08   7.


     Debbie quickly realizes where his head is at.

                             DEBBIE
               Oh... that.   Yeah, um, well I don't know-

                            STEVEN
               I swear honey- getting around the system's
               so easy. No one would even know I did it.

                            DEBBIE
               I know you want to find her Steven, but
               you need to think about this.

                            STEVEN
               You're right, I shouldn't have done it.

                            DEBBIE
               You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what'd
               you find?

     Steven shrugs.

                            STEVEN
               I haven't looked. It's downstairs.

                            DEBBIE
               Really? Well let's go!

     She moves to get up. Steven takes umbrage.

                            STEVEN
               Well hold on- let me finish.

                             DEBBIE
               Oh, right.

     Steven thrusts and tenses.

                            STEVEN
               There- that's got it.


10   INT. STEVEN AND DEBBIE'S HOUSE 1984 - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 10

     Steven flips through the file box, reading through
     various pages. Debbie watches with compassion as he
     reads. Eventually he cracks an incredulous SMILE.

                             DEBBIE
               What?

                            STEVEN
               She's right here. She's been right here
               all this time.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08     8.


                            DEBBIE
               It's really her?

                            STEVEN
               Yeah. No question.

                            DEBBIE
               My goodness Steven, that's wonderful.

     He reads on, his smile ever widening until-

     He comes across something that concerns him and his voice
     trails off. His smile fades, replaced by a look of dread.

     Debbie grows concerned.

                            DEBBIE (CONT'D)
               What? What is it? Steven?

     He cannot believe his eyes.


11   EXT. BASCOMBE HOME, VIRGINIA, 1984 - DAY                    11

     Steven walks up to a middle class home and raps on the
     screen door. A kindly woman (MRS. BASCOMBE) arrives
     behind the mesh wearing a birthday PARTY HAT.

                            MRS. BASCOMBE
                      (alarmed)
               Is something wrong officer?

                            STEVEN
               Are you Barbra Bascombe?

                            MRS. BASCOMBE
               Yes. Is something wrong? Is someone hurt?

                            STEVEN
                      (lip quivering)
               In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave
               up a baby for adoption, correct?

     An ashen look overcomes Mrs. Basham's face. She removes
     her hat.

                            MRS. BASCOMBE
               I don't think I know what you're talking
               about.

     Steven can see that behind her is a small FAMILY
     GATHERING at the table, grouped around a BIRTHDAY CAKE.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   9.


                       STEVEN
          Elizabeth City? St Jude's Hospital?
          Remember?

                       MRS. BASCOMBE
          I don't know what you're talking about.

                       STEVEN
          You were young. I know that you made a
          mistake giving me away, but-

                        MRS. BASCOMBE
          Listen-

                        STEVEN
          Shhhhhh.   Mommy please- let me finish.

What color that remains in her face drains away.

                         STEVEN (CONT'D)
          We   all make mistakes. What I came here
          to   say is, I forgive you because none of
          us   is perfect but now with a fresh start
          we   can build --

She SLAMS the door in his face.   From behind the door-

                       MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)
          I have no idea what you're talking about,
          Steven.

                       STEVEN
          No, it's okay, I know everything.    But
          it's fine. Just tell me why--

                        MRS. BASCOMBE (O.S.)
          Go away!

                       STEVEN
          Okay, okay. I understand. It's a lot at
          once. But I can come back. How's that?
          I can come back later, I'll bring us some
          coffee and we can talk about...
                 (suddenly furious)
          WHY YOU ABANDONED ME AND KEPT YOUR OTHER
          TWO CHILDREN! I WAS THE MIDDLE CHILD!
          WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?! WHAT WAS WRONG
          WITH ME!?

Tears stream down Steven's face. He gets in his car and
slams the door. And as he sits there trying to make sense
of things...
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08    10.


                            STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               I quit the force that day. I packed up
               the family and moved to Texas. I got a
               great job and got to living the American
               Dream.


12   I/E RUSSELL HOUSE - HOUSTON - 1986 - DAY                    12

     The ideal suburban American barbecue is in full swing at
     the new Russell household.

     In a series of brief vignettes, Steven shows off the
     house, his family and his new corvette.

                                                          CUT TO:

     A happy Steven moves through the backyard with a plate of
     meat fresh off the grill.

     Continuing past the buffet he enters the dining room to
     find SIX YEAR OLD STEPHANIE (same actress) happen past.
     Steven lovingly scoops her up without a thought.

                            STEPHANIE
               I can't find my blue fish.

                            DEBBIE (O.S.)
               Steven?

     He turns to see Debbie across the room talking to a YOUNG
     COUPLE. She waves him over.

                            STEVEN
                      (to Stephanie)
               In the laundry room.

     He puts her down and heads over to Debbie and the couple.

                            DEBBIE
               Steven you haven't met our new neighbors
               down two and across the street- Neil and
               Sara.

                            STEVEN
               No I haven't. I hope you're planning on
               changing the paint. What do you call that
               color?

                            NEIL
               Oh we're changing it.

     They all burst into loud breaking-the-ice laughter.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages    5-23-08   11.


                       STEVEN
          Good, good, good... good.

                       NEIL
          So Debbie tells me you used to be in the
          police force back in Georgia.

                       STEVEN
          Virginia Beach.

                       NEIL
          Right. Sorry...

                       SARA
                 (embarrassed)
          Neil...

                       STEVEN
          Yeah, kinda lost interest.     Got back into
          the family business.

                        NEIL
          Which is?

                       STEVEN
          Produce. I work for Sysco.

                       NEIL
          That's a big outfit. They give you that
          Corvette out there?

                        STEVEN
          Yes sir-ee.

                       DEBBIE
          Great benefits, too.

                       STEVEN
          And the hours don't crush me either.    I
          get plenty of home time.

                       DEBBIE
          It's good to have him where I can keep an
          eye on him.

                       STEVEN

          Among other things...

Debbie gives an embarrassed GUFFAW as he smooches on her.

13   INT. HOUSTON APT. BEDROOM (TYLER) - 1986 - NIGHT           13

     Amidst the moonlit shadows, the THUMPING of VIGOROUS
     LOVEMAKING is heard. It continues, getting louder and
     louder until we make out two forms doing it doggie-style
     in the bed.

     Building to the climax, Steven moans with pleasure.

                            STEVEN
               I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come...

     Suddenly we see the face of the MOUSTACHED MAN he's
     fucking.

                            MOUSTACHED MAN
               DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS!

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:


14   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 14

     We are back with Steven in his hospital bed at the
     Penitentiary.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Oh did I forget to mention I was gay?
               Yeah, sorry about that. I'm gay. Gay,
               gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as
               I can remember...

                                                   SMASH CUT TO:


15   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY           15

     WE'RE BACK on the hilltop from the beginning of the
     movie.

     Nine year old Steven and his three young FRIENDS crest
     the verdant hill- running and laughing through the
     backlit dandelion fluff of an idyllic summer day.

     They all collapse into the long grass like the splayed
     arms of a starfish. Catching their breath, they stare up
     at the sky- searching for shapes in the clouds.

                            LITTLE GIRL
               I see a pony! What do you see!?
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages   5-23-08     13.


                            LITTLE BOY
               I see a diesel train!

                            RED HAIRED BOY
               I see a whirlybird!

                            YOUNG STEVEN
               I see a wiener.

     They look at him with incredulity.

                            RED HAIRED BOY
               What?! What kind of wiener?

                            YOUNG STEVEN
               A man's wiener.

                            LITTLE BOY
               Shut up! There's no wiener!

                              YOUNG STEVEN
               Uh huh!

                            RED HAIRED BOY
               No there's not!

     There is a long silence.   Then-

                            LITTLE GIRL
               Oh I see it. There it is!

                              YOUNG STEVEN
               Told ya...

     And as the other boys squint closely...

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Anyway where was I? Oh yeah--

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:


16   INT. HOUSTON BEDROOM - 1986 - NIGHT                        16

     Once again, the MOUSTACHED MAN throws his head back in
     the throes of lust.

                            MOUSTACHED MAN
               DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS!

     Steven drives it home.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   14.


                            STEVEN (V.O.)
                      (matter of fact)
               And I did.


17   EXT. HOUSTON APARTMENT DOORWAY, 1986 - LATER THAT NIGHT     17

     The Moustached Man and Steven say goodbye at the door.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               I had been living a lie for a long, long
               time. I tend to do that... hide things.

                            MOUSTACHED MAN
               You be careful out there, you're a little
               drunk.


18   EXT. HOUSTON STREET - 1986 - NIGHT                          18

     Steven drives his red Corvette, hard top removed, with a
     contented look on his face. He glows as the Pet Shop
     Boys' "West End Girls" plays on the radio.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
               Now just because I was screwing around
               doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did.
               I loved her with all my heart...
               Stephanie too. My family was all I had
               and they needed me. So I told myself it
               was just a little lie and it was better
               for everybody if it stayed that way.
                      (beat)
               That's what I told myself. But life has a
               way of forcing these things into the
               light.

     CRASH! A CROSSING PICKUP TRUCK smashes into the driver
     side door-- violently propelling steven and his corvette
     out of frame.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               You might even call it an epiphany.

20   EXT. DITCH - HOUSTON, 1986 - LATER THAT NIGHT               20

     Badly mangled and triaged, Steven stares intently at the
     night sky with his one good eye as Paramedics remove him
     from the ditch on a back-board. The remains of the
     corvette are all around.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   15.


                            STEVEN
                      (low murmur)
               I haven't lived my life.

                            PARAMEDIC
               Try not to talk sir.

                            STEVEN
                      (bleary)
               Fuck you... No one is going to tell me
               what to do anymore. No more lies. I'm
               going to live my life. My way. Be the
               real me. Time for some good living. Buy
               what I want, do what I want, fuck who I
               want. My way.

                            PARAMEDIC
               Okay sir whatever you say.

                            STEVEN
               I'm gonna be a fag.

                              PARAMEDIC
               Okay.

                              STEVEN
               A big fag...

                            PARAMEDIC
               Alright.
                      (to other paramedic)
               Let's move.


21   INT. HOUSTON HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - 1986 - NIGHT               21

     Debbie walks alongside a DOCTOR, deeply concerned and
     listening to his assessment.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Yep, just like that I decided to start my
               life over and live it like the real me.
               No more lies. I was born again.


22   INT. HOUSTON HOSPITAL - 1986 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS           22

     Debbie enters the room to find Steven, bandaged and
     bristling with tubes.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               It would be hard to break it to Debbie,
               but I knew I'd find a way...
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages      5-23-08   16.


     He turns his head to her and smiles wide.

                            STEVEN
               Honey, I'm gay!

     Debbie freezes, she can't believe her ears.   And as she
     stares at his smiling face in shock...

                             STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               To my surprise, we stayed friends.
                      (then)
               And I was finally free.

                                                          FADE IN:


23   EXT. STREET - SOUTH BEACH FLORIDA - 1992 - DAY               23

     VINTAGE MAMBO MUSIC. Palm trees line an upscale Palm
     Beach shopping district. Well-heeled nabobs cruise the
     boulevard, shopping and being seen.

     Two MINIATURE DOBERMAN PINSCHERS on a tandem leash appear
     from around a corner soon followed by the NEW STEVEN with
     a handsome young man on his arm (JIMMY KEMPLE).

     Steven's pajama-like clothes, perfect tan and loose
     demeanor make him the very essence of a man with new
     found freedoms.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Life was good. Everything was falling
               right into place. I moved to Florida, got
               a new job, had two adorable pups, I was
               dating a cute guy named Jimmy. I could
               do anything I wanted...


24   INT. GAY CLUB - MIAMI, 1992 - NIGHT                          24

     DANCE MUSIC THUMPS as Steven passes around a tray of
     drinks to friends.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               But it didn't take me long to realize
               something that never occurred to me
               before. Actually no one ever talks about
               this but...

     When everyone is served, he raises his glass and let's
     loose a PARTY HOOT. They concur and drink.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages   5-23-08   17.


                             STEVEN (V.O.)
               ...being gay is really expensive.
                      (beat)
               It is.

     Steven leans over and makes out with Kemple.


25   QUICK MONTAGE                                               25

     QUICK CUTS of Steven enjoying his gay life with Kemple at
     BOUTIQUES, SALONS, RESORTS, GYMS, HAUTE CUISINE
     RESTAURANTS, etc...

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               I mean it's not just sucking cock. It's
               wardrobe, it's hair, personal trainers,
               big labels, resorts, fine dining... it
               goes on and on and on. So I needed money.
               And for a guy without a college
               education, my options were limited.


26   INT. GROCERY STORE - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY                      26

     Steven inexplicably pours cooking oil out onto a grocery
     store aisle with a basket slung over his arm.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               So I had no choice--
                      (beat, giddy)
               I became a con man!

     SLIP-WHAM! Steven throws himself in the air and falls
     flat on his back with a scream.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Of course that was easy for me, every
               closet case is a con anyways.

     And as people gather around, he grasps his neck and moans
     litigiously--


27   INT. LAW OFFICE - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY                         27

     OPEN CLOSE on A PARALEGAL. She opens a briefcase and
     removes an envelope.

     CUT TO REVEAL Steven holding crutches at his side, across
     from a few LAWYERS. The paralegal hands him the envelope.

                             LAWYER
               Your check.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    18.


                            STEVEN
               Thank you.

     With great difficulty, Steven gets on his crutches and
     makes his exit.

                            STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Now it didn't happen all at once. It was
               sort of a gradual thing...


28   EXT. GROCERY RECEIVING DOCK - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY             28

     An OLD WAREHOUSE MANAGER emerges from a darkened AMITY
     FOODSERVICE trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand. As
     he steps out onto the dock, he passes Steven, who is
     talking with a 500 pound PRODUCE MANAGER.

     Tomato crates are all around.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to
               buy low grade tomatoes in the field and
               sell them to clueless chain stores as
               higher grade.

                            PRODUCE MANAGER
               These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right?

                            STEVEN
                      (big smile)
               Finest in the land...

     And as they talk-

                            STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               It's called `field buying'. I could clear
               three thousand dollars in a good week
               doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough.


29   INT. MIAMI JEWELRY STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                 29

     Steven stands before a SALESPERSON at a counter.

                            SALESWOMAN
               Cash or charge?

                            STEVEN
               Charge...

     Steven flips through a handful of identical CREDIT CARDS.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   19.


                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
                      (sotto)
               Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell,
               Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven M
               Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell...
                      (seeing one he likes)
               Ah!

     He gives a card to a smiling SALESWOMAN.

                            SALESWOMAN
               Thank you...
                      (reading card)
               ...Mister Evans. Can I see some ID?

                            STEVEN
               Of course.

     And as Steven riffles through an equally large stack of
     DRIVER'S LICENSES...


30   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                      30

     Steven stands atop a escalator, looking around.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               But when money got really tight, the slip
               and fall always came in handy.

     He throws himself down the escalator, out of frame to the
     floor below. Painful tumbling is heard.

     At the BOTTOM of the escalator a hard THUD is heard.      A
     beat later, Steven's feet slide into frame.


31   INT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1992 - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 31

     CHRISTMAS MUSIC.

     Dressed in pajamas, Steven and Kemple sit cross-legged at
     the base of their Christmas Tree, surrounded by torn
     paper and strewn gifts. Steven's arm is in a cast.

     Kemple opens a hinged case to reveal a GOLD Rolex watch.

                            KEMPLE
               Oh wow...

                            STEVEN
               What do you think? Yes?
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages       5-23-08   20.


                            KEMPLE
               Well Steven it's beautiful.     It really
               is.

                            STEVEN
               You don't like it.

                             KEMPLE
               No, no, no.   I do.

                            STEVEN
               You don't like it.

                            KEMPLE
               I'm menstruating. Don't listen to me.

                            STEVEN
               Tell me what's wrong with it.        Is it the
               gold?

                             KEMPLE
               Well...

                            STEVEN
               That's why I got you the stainless!

     He takes out another box and hands it to Kemple.

                             KEMPLE
               Steven!

     As he opens it, Steven grabs the gold Rolex.

                            STEVEN
               The gold one is for me, dipshit.

     Kemple smiles broadly as he admires his new watch.

     The PHONE RINGS. Steven rushes to answer it.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
               Merry Christmas!


32   INT. DEBBIE'S HOUSTON HOME, 1992 - MORNING - CONTINUOUS        32

     Debbie, on the phone, is INTERCUT. Stephanie is in the
     background, opening gifts at the base of their tree.

                            DEBBIE
               Merry Christmas.

                             STEVEN
               Hi Debbie!
"I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages     5-23-08   21.


                         DEBBIE
          How's Jimmy?

                        STEVEN
          Good.   Did you get the gifts?

                       DEBBIE
          Well that's why I'm calling...

CUT WIDE to reveal a GIFT BOX FILLED WITH STACKS OF CASH.

                       STEVEN
          You're welcome!

                       DEBBIE
          I can't keep this.

                         STEVEN
          Why not?

                       DEBBIE
          Well... it's not Christian.

                       STEVEN
          Not Christian? Why's that?

                       DEBBIE
          This is not what the Lord wants.

                       STEVEN
          So you're saying you know what the Lord
          wants?

                       DEBBIE
          No. I would never say that. Why? Do you
          think this is what he wants?

                       STEVEN
          It's the leap of faith Deb.       It's the not
          knowing that's the answer.

This gets traction with Debbie.

                       DEBBIE
          Well I never thought about it that way...

                         STEPHANIE (O.S.)
          Mommy look!

CUT TO REVEAL Stephanie has her own BOX OF CASH.

                         DEBBIE
          Steven!
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages    5-23-08   22.


     And as Steven listens to Debbie's rant--

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Of course, Jimmy and Debbie had no idea
               what I was up to. For the time being, at
               least...


33   INT. AMITY FOOD SERVICE - MIAMI, 1992 - MORNING             33

     Steven exits an elevator and saunters into work, happy as
     ever. He passes the AMITY FOODSERVICE Logo and a CHERUBIC
     SECRETARY.

                            STEVEN
               Morning Sandy!

                            CHERUBIC SECRETARY
               Morning Steven. You have visitors.

                             STEVEN
               Okey-dokey!

     Steven quickly gets a deeply concerned look on his face
     as he approaches his office.

     The door is slightly ajar. He secretly peeks in to see...

     TWO FEDERAL MARSHALLS wait in Steven's office. He
     instantly knows what's going on.

                            STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
               Federal Marshalls...

                                                          CUT TO:


34   INT. AMITY FOOD SERVICE - MIAMI, 1992 - MORNING             34

     Steven paces nervously outside the elevator, growing more
     and more anxious as he waits.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               They wanted me for all sorts of stuff-
               Insurance fraud, identity theft, passport
               fraud. They were probably gonna
               extradite me all the way back to Texas. I
               had to decide what to do next.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08    23.


34A   EXT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1992 - DAY                     34A

      Steven's Ford Bronco cruises past the apartment building
      to find a few POLICE CARS parked outside. He drives on.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:


35    EXT. ABANDONED LOT - FLORIDA, 1992 - DAY                    35

      Steven BLUBBERS TO HIMSELF inside his Bronco which is
      parked in a bleak lot near a looming billboard.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                But one thing was for sure-- I was not
                gonna let them put me away. I was a cop
                and I knew what jail was like. And there
                was no way I was going there. I had a
                plan.

      He continues to CRY uncontrollably as he raises a
      PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and dumps all the pills into his
      mouth. He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a
      bottle of Galliano to wash it down.

      He starts up the car.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine.


36    EXT. ROAD - FLORIDA 1992 - DAY                              36

      CARS PASS through frame, quickly heading wherever it is
      they are going. Moments later, a car horn is heard,
      incessantly blaring and building in volume until--

      STEVEN'S CAR IDLES INTO FRAME AT 1 MPH. The Heights',
      "How Do You Talk To An Angel" is barely audible over the
      car horn and STEVEN is slumped over the steering wheel.

      Moments later, it veers off down into the grassy shoulder
      and out of frame.

                                                      FADE OUT.


37    INT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL - 1992 - MORNING                   37

      Steven awakes in a hospital bed. He looks around and
      eventually looks through the observation glass into the
      hallway. He sees Debbie talking to a COP.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   24.


                              KEMPLE (O.S.)
               Hey...

     He readjusts to see Jimmy sitting nearby.

                              STEVEN
                        (bleary)
               Sorry.

                            KEMPLE
               Why didn't you tell me?

                            STEVEN
               I can't go to prison, Jimmy. I can't. I
               can't go to prison. I can't. I can't...

                            KEMPLE
               Okay-okay calm down. It's okay. I just
               want to tell them you're awake and we can
               take it from there.

     Confident that Steven is calm, Jimmy steps into the hall.


38   INT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - 1992 - CONTINUOUS         38

     Jimmy joins Debbie and the Cop in the hallway.    Steven is
     visible in bed through the glass.

                            DEBBIE
               Did you know Steven was wanted?

                            KEMPLE
               Not until just now.

                            DEBBIE
               He likes to keep little secrets
               sometimes.

                            KEMPLE
               Like the fact that he was a big queer?

                            DEBBIE
               Yeah, like that.

                            KEMPLE
               But suicide, my god.

                            DEBBIE
               Well he does tend to overreact.

                            KEMPLE
               I feel like I don't even know him.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   25.


                       DEBBIE
          Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not
          really sure he knows who he is. He's
          searching, at least that's how I figure
          it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is
          he's looking for.

                       KEMPLE
                 (to cop)
          Can you tell me exactly what he did?

As they CONTINUE TO TALK, they fail to notice Steven
getting out of bed and looking around blearily.

He picks up a bedpan, reaches into his gown and absent-
mindedly PISSES-- missing the pan completely.

                       COP
          He has several warrants out in Texas.
          Fraud, forgery, embezzlement...

                       DEBBIE
          What?

                       KEMPLE
          I should have known... I should have said
          something.

                       DEBBIE
          Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the
          same thing. There were always signs. I
          should have known he was gay when he
          started shaving his chest.

                       KEMPLE
          That would be a warning sign...

                       DEBBIE
          And all that Peter Allen music on his
          Walkman.

                       KEMPLE
          Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel
          so bad now.

                       DEBBIE
          I just never thought. But now stealing?

                       KEMPLE
          He's probably been doing it for years.    I
          say to myself he did it just to buy me
          things but I don't think that's true.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    26.


                            DEBBIE
               It's bigger than that. I'm sure.

                            KEMPLE
               But why then?

                            DEBBIE
               And why suicide? I mean- just like that?

     After that, he dresses and walks out the door behind
     them.

                            KEMPLE
               I know- he seemed so happy and--

     Just then Debbie notices Steven is not in bed and looks
     up in time to see him disappearing around the corner.

                            DEBBIE
               Steven!!!


39   EXT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL PARKING STRUCTURE - 1992 - DAY     39

     Debbie, Kemple and the Cop exit the hospital and look
     around frantically. They spot him running across the open
     air lot and give chase.

     Steven comes to a stairwell door. It's locked. He runs
     some more and finds himself cornered at the guard rail.

                            KEMPLE
               Steven!!! Stop!

     Kemple, Debbie and the cop slowly approach. Steven
     glances over the guard rail. ONE FLOOR DOWN is an OPENED
     DUMPSTER.

                            KEMPLE (CONT'D)
               Steven!

     Steven looks down again. Kemple knows what he's thinking.

                            KEMPLE (CONT'D)
               Wait Steven. Don't!

     Steven looks down. The soft bags of trash below beckon
     him to freedom.

                            KEMPLE (CONT'D)
               Steven I'm serious! You stop or you'll
               never see me again!
                      (no response)
               I mean it!
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages       5-23-08   27.


      Steven looks to Kemple and then to the Cop right behind
      him. HE JUMPS and--

                                KEMPLE (CONT'D)
                 STEVEN!

      They run to the guard rail and look over to see--

      Steven lies MOANING and delirious on his back NEXT TO THE
      DUMPSTER.

                                                             FADE OUT.


40    EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY BREEZEWAY, 1995 - DAY                40

      As inmates CHANT and STOMP, a new inmate walks the line
      to his new cell clutching his prison issue belongings.

      Although we can only see him from behind, we can only
      assume this is Steven. He continues his walk amidst a
      shower of stares and JEERS and THREATS raining upon him.

                               INMATES
                         (yelling)


40A   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY CELL BLOCK, 1995 - DAY              40A

      The unseen inmate continues past the open cells of his
      new home and eventually the unseen inmate enters a cell
      to find--


41    INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY PRISON CELL, 1995 - CONTINUOUS 41

      STEVEN is reclined on his bunk, relaxed and ready to
      greet the inmate (his new cellmate ARNIE) with a smile.

                              STEVEN
                 Hi. Welcome to prison.     I'm Steven.

      Arnie is scared.     Terrified.   Speechless.

                              STEVEN (CONT'D)
                 Oh don't worry, I'm not gonna hurt you.
                 First time?

      He nods.

                              STEVEN (CONT'D)
                 Shit, I was so scared when I first got
                 here. But you get used to it.

     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08     28.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
               Only took me a year. You just need to
               know a few ins and outs and you'll be
               fine.


42   EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY BREEZEWAY, 1995 - DAY           42

     Steven escorts Arnie through the prison, waving to
     various inmates and guards along the way.

                             STEVEN
                      (upbeat)
               You're gonna catch a beating any day now,
               that's just the way it is. I lost three
               teeth and cracked a vertebrae. Anyway,
               all you need to do is fight back. Win or
               lose, just fight back.
                      (then)
               Or you could try to suck the guys' dick.
               Your choice.

     He moves on.


43   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY LAW LIBRARY - 1995 - DAY        43

     Steven and Arnie stand at the door of the prison's law
     library.

                            STEVEN
               Law Library. I pretty much live here. I
               don't really have anyone on the outside
               except my ex-wife- so I just hunker down
               here learning everything there is to know
               about the law. Ask me anything.

     Arnie has no response. Steven points across the library
     where a menacing OLDER INMATE studies a law book.

                             STEVEN (CONT'D)
               See him. Over there? Him? Anything you
               want from outside, he's the guy. Candy,
               cigarettes, drugs, whatever. He's the
               guy.
                      (then)
               Just keep in mind- it's gonna cost you a
               lot of money. Or you could suck his
               dick. Your choice.


44   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY CAFETERIA - 1995 - DAY          44

     Steven and Arnie stand outside the empty cafeteria.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   29.


                            STEVEN
               Three meals a day. Not so bad. Just make
               sure if you make enemies with someone, he
               doesn't work here. Otherwise you'll wake
               up one morning shitting blood and find
               out you've been eating ground glass in
               your cornbread for six weeks.

     Arnie notices one of the INMATES working in the kitchen
     SPITTING a loogey into the mashed potatoes. He mixes it
     in and CACKLES with glee.

     Steven pays no mind.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
               Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His
               name's Gary.


45   EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY BREEZEWAY, 1995 - DAY            45

     A mean-looking con named GARY mans a mail-cart while he
     talks with Steven and Arnie.

                            GARY
                      (mid-sentence)
               ...letters, magazines, shit like that- it
               all goes through unmolested. But if
               Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or
               brownies or whatever-- you're gonna have
               to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five
               bucks per item or you can suck my dick.

     Steven turns to Arnie.

                              STEVEN
               Your choice.


46   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY CELL BLOCK - 1995 - DAY          46

     Steven and Arnie arrive at the doorway of their cell.

                            STEVEN
               Well that's about it. You're gonna be
               fine. Don't worry. And if you need
               anything you just let me know. Alright?

     Arnie thinks a moment.

                            ARNIE
               So, uh, do I need to suck your dick?
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   30.


                            STEVEN
               That'd be great.

     Steven gently shoves his new cellmate into the cell.


47   INT. TX STATE PEN - PHONE BANK/COMMON AREA - 1995 - DAY     47

     Steven is on one of the many pay phones.

                            DEBBIE (O.S.)
               Hi this is Debbie and Steffie. Sorry we
               missed you. Leave a message. God Bless!

     BEEP.

                            STEVEN
               Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed
               you. I thought one o'clock was our time
               but maybe not. I sure miss you guys.
               Thanks for the picture and the article.
               Sometimes it's just nice to know there's
               someone out there who still cares about
               me since Jimmy left and all. So... uh...

     Steven is holding the stainless steel ROLEX he gave
     Kemple as a gift. He regards it wistfully.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
                      (thinking, drifting)
               Do you think I broke his heart?
                      (snapping out of it)
               Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the
               machine... I'll try you again next time.
               One O'clock. Don't forget.

     He hangs up. Bored and lonely, he has a moment of repose.
     Just then, a loud RUCKUS across the COMMON AREA gets his
     attention.

     Steven watches as a group of ROWDY PRISONERS throw
     whatever they can find at a small BIRD as it flies
     around, trapped in the cavernous hall.

     The men LAUGH and HOOT as the bird is struck down and
     lies motionless on the ground.

     As the prisoners resume their activities, Steven notices
     a GENTLE LOOKING INMATE approaching the bird.

     Rapt, Steven watches as the inmate sympathetically scoops
     up the bird and walks off. Steven is quite taken.

48   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - LAW LIBRARY - 1995 - DAY       48

     The gentle inmate, PHILLIP MORRIS, is a slightly built,
     handsome blonde boy-man. He struggles to reach a book on
     a high shelf. Helpless and irresistible, he is surprised
     when Steven reaches in to help retrieve the book.

     Their eyes lock and they stare in a short silence, until-

                            PHILLIP
                      (slightly Blanche DuBois)
               Thanks. Guess I need a few extra inches.

                            STEVEN
               Glad to help. How's the bird?

                            PHILLIP
               Huh?
                      (realizing)
               Oh. Him, yeah... he's at peace.

                            STEVEN
               Oh, I'm sorry.

                            PHILLIP
               It was for the best. He was suffering.

     Steven acknowledges his kindness with a smile.

                            STEVEN
                      (referring to law book)
               Civil law? You know, I'm an attorney.

                            PHILLIP
               Really?

                            STEVEN
               You suing someone?

                            PHILLIP
               I don't know what I'm doing. There's a
               guy I know- he's in the infirmary now.
               He's sick- he's real sick... AIDS. I
               thought maybe I could find a way to get
               him some help- I mean real help. Not
               here. I don't know- maybe I could-- I
               don't even know what I'm looking for...

     Steven is intrigued.

                            STEVEN
               Does he have a lawyer?
"I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   32.


                         PHILLIP
          Yeah.

                       STEVEN
          Have him get in touch with the Prisoner
          Rights Committee. They deal with this all
          the time- pro bono. I've got the number.

                       PHILLIP
          Well thank you, I--

                       STEVEN
          My name's Steven Russell.

                       PHILLIP
          Pleased to meet you Steven Russell, my
          name's Phillip Morris.

                       STEVEN
          I haven't seen you around Phillip. I'm
          always in the yard...

                       PHILLIP
          I don't go to the yard. You know what
          happens to blonde haired, blue eyed
          queers in the yard...

                        STEVEN
          It is kind of rough out there.
                 (then)
          You don't look like you belong here
          Phillip.

                         PHILLIP
          I don't.

                       STEVEN
          Why are you here?

                       PHILLIP
          I rented a car... and kept it too long.

                         STEVEN
          Grand theft?

                       PHILLIP
          Theft of service.

                       STEVEN
          Insurance fraud.

                       PHILLIP
          No. Just theft of service.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   33.


                               STEVEN
               No.     Me. Insurance fraud.

                            PHILLIP
               Damn, we're both in a mess aren't we?

                            STEVEN
               Don't seem fair, does it?

                            PHILLIP
               No, it don't.

                            STEVEN
               You know, I keep finding that life's a
               little shittier than I thought it was
               gonna be.

                            PHILLIP
               Oh, listen to you, Gloomy Gus. I think
               you're gonna be just fine, Steven
               Russell.

     Steven takes this to heart.

                            STEVEN
                      (playful)
               I guess I'm inclined to believe you.

                              PHILLIP
               Why's that?

                            STEVEN
               I met you today, didn't I?

     Phillip smiles.


49   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - LAW LIBRARY - 1995 - LATER     49

     Steven sits close to Phillip at a table. A large open law
     text lies between them.

                            STEVEN
                      (mid-sentence)
               ...I made the mistake of writing her and
               saying I was lonely in here. And next
               thing you know, my ex-wife catches her
               putting the neighbor's puppy in a box to
               mail to me.

                            PHILLIP
               Ohhhhh, she sounds so sweet...
"I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   34.


                        STEVEN
          Oh she's an angel.
                 (then)
          I think I'll be sure to write her back
          and tell her I'm not lonely anymore...
          that I made a good friend.

Phillip smirks for a moment, but soon Steven notices the
smirk turn to a reticent frown.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          What?

                       PHILLIP
          Why'd I have to meet you today?

                       STEVEN
          Something wrong?

                       PHILLIP
          It's just- I'm being transferred to
          Michael Unit today.

                       STEVEN
          What?

                       PHILLIP
          I'm sorry.

                       STEVEN
          Don't be sorry. It's just across the
          yard.

                        PHILLIP
          Well I don't go into that yard so it
          might as well be Oklahoma.
                 (then)
          Just figures with my luck. I was born
          Friday the 13th...

                       STEVEN
          It's not gonna change a thing, Phillip.
          In fact, Friday the 13th's my lucky day.
          Don't worry, this right here. This is
          destiny.

                       PHILLIP
          But we only just met.

                       STEVEN
          Listen, I've loved a lot. And I've been
          around, so I recognize the feeling.

     "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages    5-23-08   35.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
               That one you and me are having right now-
               the one you're trying to forget exists
               because you're going away. But there's
               about 6000 volts shooting across this
               table here and you know you can't deny
               it.

                            PHILLIP
               Don't you think you're coming on a little
               strong?

                            STEVEN
               I know you're trying to protect yourself,
               I get that. It's fine. Give me a chance
               to prove you wrong.

     Phillip is melting but tries to hide it.

                            PHILLIP
               I'm sure I don't know what you're talking
               about.

     Steven smiles wide as if to throw down the gauntlet.

                              STEVEN
               Good...

     Phillip turns to walk away and hides his giddyness.


50   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - MICHAEL UNIT, 1995 - DAY           50

     Phillip passes the cells of Michael Unit, clutching his
     belongings and soon enters his cell. He looks around
     sheepishly until he is interrupted-

                              CLEAVON (O.S.)
               You Phillip?

     Phillip turns to see CLEAVON- a huge black inmate mopping
     the hall outside his cell

                              PHILLIP
               Yes.

     He tosses Phillip a folded note.      He catches it and looks
     at it with a smile.

                              PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               Already?

     Phillip opens it up. As he reads, his face brightens
     considerably.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    36.


                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               Phillip, hope your new place is nice.
               Nice enough anyway. I hope the chocolate
               made it to you okay. Check the T.P.

     Phillip looks at the spare roll of toilet paper and turns
     it over. A small chocolate bar is stuck in the tube.

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               I hope you try to make some new friends
               and not be too shy. I guess I should tell
               you a little bit about myself...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


51   INT. TX STATE PEN - MICHAEL UNIT - PHILLIP'S CELL - DAY     51

     OPEN CLOSE ON a note as Phillip scrawls it.

                            PHILLIP (V.O.)
               Dear Steven. I keep thinking about you
               saying I'm shy. I guess you're right,
               but I don't feel shy around you. I think
               that means something...

     As his VO continues, Phillip folds up the paper and
     passes it through the bars back to Cleavon.


52   INT./EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 (MONTAGE)             52

     VARIOUS SHOTS as we follow the note being passed by
     different hands and means throughout the prison on its
     way to Steven.

                            PHILLIP (V.O.)
               Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I
               should tell you I'm diabetic so I
               probably shouldn't... but I did anyway.
               It's been so long since anyone's shown me
               any kindness and well, it means a lot. I
               just wish you were here...


53   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1995 - STEVEN'S CELL - CONTINUOUS        53

     Steven reads the letter on his bunk.

                            PHILLIP (V.O.)
               ...Write me back soon. Phillip.

     Steven finishes the letter and folds it up, looking
     strangely expressionless.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   37.


54   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - DAY           54

     Phillip peers out of his cell to see Cleavon working his
     way nearer with his mop. He's giddy.

     Moments later, Cleavon passes him by. Phillip is bummed.


55   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NEXT DAY      55

     Again Phillip watches as Cleavon passes his cell without
     leaving a note.


56   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NEXT DAY      56

     Phillip lays in bed, impatiently. He seems upset. He
     anxiously peers out the bars and catches a glimpse of the
     mopping Cleavon working his way closer to his cell.

                            PHILLIP
               Hurry up would you?

                            CLEAVON
               I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot.
               Besides I ain't got nothing for you
               anyway...

                            PHILLIP
               But it's been three days.

                            CLEAVON
               You got a tracking number, motherfucker?

                            PHILLIP
               No.

                            CLEAVON
               Then shut your faggot ass.

     Phillip slumps back onto his bed, depressed.

                            PHILLIP
               Congratulations Phillip, scared off
               another one.

     A few moments later, he's startled by the CLANG of his
     cell door sliding open.

     He looks up - a CORRECTIONS OFFICER stands over him.

                            CORRECTIONS OFFICER
               Morris - you got a new roommate.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08   38.


     This is no consolation to Phillip. He heaves a heavy sigh
     until he sees STEVEN enter his cell, clutching a pile of
     belongings.

     Phillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind
     Steven.

                            PHILLIP
               Oh my God. How the hell did you do this?

     Steven slowly moves closer.

                            STEVEN
               I know a guy. I took care of it.   I'm
               gonna take care of everything...

     Steven gently caresses Phillip's face. Phillip is
     melting. Then suddenly, Phillip grabs Steven's ass.

                            PHILLIP
               Enough romance, let's fuck.

     They launch themselves onto the bunk and as they get to
     business...


                                                        FADE OUT.


57   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - THAT NIGHT 57

     Phillip and Steven spoon in a glowing post-coital cuddle.

                            PHILLIP
               And for a while I was Executive Assistant
               to a Broadway Producer...

                           STEVEN
               Really? What's a Broadway producer doing
               in Atlanta?

                            PHILLIP
               I didn't ask.

                            STEVEN
               What'd you do for him?

                            PHILLIP
               I mainly just rode around town in his
               limo, drinking and sucking him off.

     There's a moment of silence, then a realization...
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08    39.


                            PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               Now that I hear myself say it, I think he
               was just some rich chicken hawk.

     They get a GIGGLE out of this.

                            PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               Oh well, he was a nice guy. I only dated
               him for a little while anyway. Then I
               dated this full-blooded Apache who made
               me dress up like a baseball player.

                            STEVEN
               Apache? What was his name?

                            PHILLIP
               Melvin.

                            STEVEN
               Phillip- you amaze me.

                            PHILLIP
               What? He was a nice guy too.

                            STEVEN
               That's what I'm saying- you only see the
               good.

     Phillip shrugs, but before he can reply- a piercing human
     SCREECH interrupts him.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
               What the hell was that?

                                                          CUT TO:


58   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - SCREECHER'S CELL - NIGHT       58

     The inmate who spit a loogey into the mashed potatoes in
     the cafeteria is sitting up on his bed, SCREECHING at the
     top of his lungs. This is "THE SCREECHER"

                                                         BACK TO:

     Phillip continues to talk.

                            PHILLIP
               That's the Screecher next door. He does
               it all night. I never get any sleep. He
               drives me crazy.

                            STEVEN
               You poor thing. How awful...
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   40.


     The Screecher continues his routine.

                                                        FADE OUT.

60   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN CANTEEN, 1995 - - DAY                 60

     Phillip emerges from the line munching on a candy bar
     when he notices a ruckus on the other side of the fence.

     He wanders over to see a LARGE PRISONER beating the crap
     out of the Screecher.

                            LARGE PRISONER
               I'm gonna cut out your motherfucking
               tongue with your screeching all night.

     As guards descend on the two, the Large Prisoner
     continues to beat on the screeching SCREECHER.

     Phillip sidles up next to a BALD PRISONER.

                            PHILLIP
               What does he care- he ain't in our
               block...

                            BALD PRISONER
               Someone probably paid him.


61   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - LATER        61

     Reclined on his bunk, Steven does a crossword puzzle.
     Phillip enters, standing by the door.

                            PHILLIP
               Get up...

     Steven sits up.

                            PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               Did you pay to have the Screecher beat
               up?

                            STEVEN
               Me?

                            PHILLIP
               Don't bullshit me. Did you pay to have
               him beat up?
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   41.


                            STEVEN
               Well you said he bothered you.

                            PHILLIP
               Just answer me.

                            STEVEN
               Yeah. Yeah, I did.

                            PHILLIP
               Steven...

     A tear comes to Phillip's eye.

                            PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               This is the most romantic thing anyone's
               ever done for me.

     He clamps onto Steven and hugs with all his life.

                            STEVEN
               I just want you to be happy, baby.

                            PHILLIP
               You are so amazing!!!

     And as they roll on the bed playfully...


62   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - CLEAVON'S CELL - NIGHT        62

     CLEAVON lays on his cot staring at the ceiling.
     Eventually a hand enters through the bars holding a
     cassette tape.

                            PHILLIP (O.S.)
               Cleavon- put this in.

                            CLEAVON
               No man- not now.

                            PHILLIP (O.S.)
               It's important.

                            CLEAVON
               How important?

     Phillip's hand disappears for a moment and comes back
     with a FIVE DOLLAR BILL.

                            CLEAVON (CONT'D)
               Ten.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   42.


                            PHILLIP (O.S.)
               Fine. But you gotta play the whole thing.

                            CLEAVON
               Yeah, alright.

                              PHILLIP (O.S.)
               Promise?

                            CLEAVON
               Fuck you- my word's my bond motherfucker.

     Cleavon takes the cash and puts the tape in a BOOM BOX.

     A familiar romantic TUNE begins to play...

                            CLEAVON (CONT'D)
               Fuck man- Johnny Mathis? Fucking white-
               ass nigger...

     He buries his head in the pillow as "Chances Are" plays.


63   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NIGHT         63

     As the MUSIC seeps into their dark cell, Steven reads a
     LAW BOOK by pen light. Phillip grabs Steven's hand and
     tries to pull him off the bed.

                              PHILLIP
               C'mon...

                              STEVEN
               What?

                            PHILLIP
               C'mon. Dance.

                            STEVEN
               No. No... I can't dance.

                              PHILLIP
               Yes you can.

                            STEVEN
               No I can't. I'm serious...

                            PHILLIP
               Honey, you're queer- it comes with the
               package.

                              STEVEN
               Well not me.

                            PHILLIP
               C'mon, I'll show you...

     He drags him up and begins his lesson.

                            PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               Hold me here... and here. Okay watch...

     Steven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a
     while, but with Phillip's help he begins to settle in.

     Soon they are nestled into each other, swaying sweetly to
     the music.


64   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - COMMON AREA - NIGHT            64

     The MUSIC CONTINUES as a group of prisoners watch a VHS
     copy of GHOST on a TV.

     Phillip wipes away a tear and Steven holds him closer
     while, in the front row, a ONE-EYED LATINO jerks off to
     the sight of Demi Moore.

                            LATINO MAN
               Yeah you fucking bitch...


65   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - CAFETERIA - DAY                65

     MUSIC CONTINUES as tray after tray is filled with gray
     slop. This persists until suddenly two of the trays
     receive a beautiful STEAK and some SHRIMP.

     Steven nods at the Slopmaster and offers a wink to a very
     impressed Phillip.


66   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - SHOWERS - MORNING              66

     MUSIC CONTINUES as Phillip and Steven shave side by side,
     smiling at one another.


67   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 -PHILLIP'S CELL - NIGHT          67

     MUSIC plays on as Steven and Phillip continue their
     romantic dance.

     They are unfazed as the lights in the cellblock go out
     with the loud sound of circuits tripping. They dance on.

                             GUARD (O.S.)
               LIGHTS OUT!
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   44.


     Eventually, the hollow sound of Johnny Mathis
     reverberating through the block is the only thing we
     hear. They dance on.

                             GUARD (O.S.) (CONT'D)
               LIGHTS OUT!

     They continue to dance. Footsteps approaching are heard.

                            GUARD (CONT'D)
               I said lights out. Turn it off.

                            CLEAVON (O.S.)
               Fuck you pig.

                            GUARD (O.S.)
               Turn it off or we're coming in.

                            CLEAVON (O.S.)
               Well come on in. I got a dick that needs
               sucking.

     CLANK! OFFSCREEN we hear the cell door open and the sound
     of a scuffle is heard.

                            VOICES (O.S.)
               ON THE GROUND! FUCK YOU! MY WORD IS MY
               FUCKING BOND! MY WORD IS MY FUCKING BOND!

     And as the sounds of a horrendous beating echo through
     the cellblock, Phillip and Steven dance their dance-
     oblivious to all but each other.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.


68   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - MORNING       68

     Phillip and Steven sleep soundly together in the bunk. A
     CLAXON blares and their cell door OPENS- accompanied by
     the sound of a dozen others.

                            GUARD (O.S.)
               Rise and shine!

     They barely stir until-- CLANG-CLANG-CLANG! A GUARD hits
     the bars with his club.

                             GUARD (CONT'D)
               Russell!   Get up!

     Steven and Phillip are rudely awakened.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   45.


                             GUARD (CONT'D)
                Grab your shit! Let's go!

      The GUARDS enter to roust Steven.

                             PHILLIP
                What's happening?

                             GUARD
                You're transferred. Nonney snitched you
                out about the Screecher. You're going to
                Ramsey Two.

                             STEVEN
                Ah shit...

      They grab Steven and yank him out of the cell.

                             PHILLIP
                Wait!

      Phillip tries to follow but a guard knocks him back down
      onto the bunk.

                             STEVEN
                Don't you touch him!

                             PHILLIP
                Steven-

                             STEVEN
                Don't worry Phillip- I'll-

                             GUARD
                Shut up and move.

      They drag him off. Phillip watches with deep worry as
      another guard keeps him there. He grows more and more
      upset, pacing and working himself up.

      Finally, the guard leaves and Phillip exits his cell and
      bolts down the tier after Steven.


68A   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN BREEZEWAY, 1995 - MORNING             68A

      Phillip runs after Steven, quickly arriving at a LOCKED
      GATE. Steven is on the other side, still being escorted
      away. Phillip is forced to find an alternative route.


69    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - COMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS      69

      Phillip marches through the common area, fighting tears.

70   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - M BLOCK - CONTINUOUS           70

     Phillip runs through another cell block until he comes to
     a window. He looks outside.

                            PHILLIP
               Steven!


71   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS        71

     PHILLIP'S POV: Steven is waiting in line with some other
     prisoners to board a bus.

     Phillip can be seen through the small window, but he
     fails to get Steven's attention.

     He bangs silently on the glass.


72   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - M BLOCK - CONTINUOUS           72

     Phillip continues in vain to get Steven's attention.

                            PHILLIP
               STEVEN!! STEVEN!

     He sees the line at the sally port start to move and
     stops to think. He knows what he has to do.


73   EXT. TX STATE PEN BREEZEWAY, 1995 - YARD GATE - DAY         73

     Phillip runs down a breezeway. Eventually he reaches a
     heavily populated gate, manned by a YARD GUARD.

                            PHILLIP
               I wanna go in the yard.

                            YARD GUARD
               You do?

                            PHILLIP
               I WANNA GO IN THE YARD!

                            YARD GUARD
               Hold your horses Dorothy.

     The Yard Guard pushes a button that opens the gate and
     Phillip bursts through.

74   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - YARD - DAY                     74

     Phillip runs through the yard, passing GIANT WOLF-
     WHISTLING INMATES as they put down their weights and stop
     their basketball games.

     Phillip maintains his focus on the sally port on the
     other side of the far fence.

                             PHILLIP
               STEVEN!!!!

     Boarding the bus, Steven hears him and turns. Delighted,
     he's forced on board by a Guard before he can respond.

                             PHILLIP (CONT'D)
               STEVEN!

     Steven gets in his seat and yells out the window.

                            STEVEN
               What the hell are you doing!?

                             PHILLIP
               I love you!

                            STEVEN
               I love you too!

     VROOM! The bus starts up and begins to move.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
               We'll be together soon! I promise!

     The bus drives off. Phillip runs along with it for a
     while as they share a long goodbye. And eventually, the
     bus disappears from view.

     Phillip clings to the fence a moment, hanging on to hope.
     He slumps and turns-

     -only to find himself confronted by several HULKING
     MEMBERS OF THE ARYAN BROTHERHOOD with one thing on their
     minds.

     Phillip marches right toward them and as he draws close-

                            PHILLIP
               GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY!!!

     Startled, they split to let Phillip pass unmolested.

75   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 75

     Back in the present, Steven remains in his hospital bed
     at the Penitentiary Infirmary.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                Those were the longest three months of my
                life. I wrote to Phillip every day until
                I got released.


76   EXT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 - SALLY PORT - DAY       76

     CLANG!   The gate of the prison closes behind Steven as he
     exits.   He approaches a waiting TAXI.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                And once I did, I was determined to get
                us back together as soon as possible.


77   INT. TAXI, 1995 - CONTINUOUS                                 77

     Steven gets in.

                             STEVEN
                Hi, how are you?

                            TAXI DRIVER
                I'm well. Where you headed? The
                Greyhound?

                             STEVEN
                Nearest thrift store please.

                             TAXI DRIVER
                       (harelip)
                Sure. You mind if I tell you the word of
                our Lord, Jesus Christ?

     The car pulls out, the prison receding behind them.


78   EXT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 - SALLY PORT - LATER 78

     The same taxi pulls up in front of the prison and Steven
     emerges with a BRIEFCASE, wearing a THREE-PIECE SUIT.

     He rings the buzzer at the front gate.


79   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - GUARD BOOTH - DAY               79

     Steven approaches the DUTY OFFICER.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   49.


                            STEVEN
               Hi there, my name's Steven Rousseau. I'm
               an attorney. My client is Phillip
               Morris. I called earlier.

     The guard checks his roster.

                            DUTY OFFICER
               Mmm hmmm. There you are. Rousseau...
               Phillip Morris. Like the cigarette huh?

                            STEVEN
               I beg your pardon?


80   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - VISITING AREA - DAY            80

     Phillip enters to see Steven waiting for him on the other
     side of the glass. Thrilled, he rushes to the phone.

                            PHILLIP
               You said you'd come right away, but
               Jesus!

                            STEVEN
               I got work to do honey, I'm getting you
               out of here early. I got a hearing
               tomorrow morning, I got motions to file.
               The law don't sleep baby.

                            PHILLIP
               I love you so much.

                            STEVEN
               Phillip, you are the sweetest, most
               gentle man I have ever met. And I know
               people have taken advantage of that. But
               I don't ever want you ever to lose that
               innocence. I want to build a life with
               you Phillip. I want to protect you.

     They share a smile.

                            PHILLIP
               Get me out of here.


81   INT. DELI OFFICE - DAY                                      81

     Steven stands over a desk, talking sternly into a
     telephone.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   50.


                            STEVEN
               The motion was filed, I presented to the
               DA and got a letter from the judge- I do
               not understand what the hold up is. I'm
               not some paralegal- I am Steven fucking
               Rousseau and I expect proper
               adjudication!

     PULLOUT to reveal he's actually standing behind a
     KROEGER'S SUPERMARKET DELI COUNTER in uniform as a
     HOUSEWIFE waits impatiently. He hangs up.

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)
                      (big smile)
               My boyfriend's getting out of prison next
               week!

     She smiles back.

                             HOUSEWIFE
               How nice...

                            STEVEN
               You want mayo with that?


82   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PRISON RECEIVING AREA - DAY 82

     Steven slides paperwork through a slot in plexiglass
     window toward a RELEASE OFFICER.

                            STEVEN
               I have an early release order for Phillip
               Morris.

     The Officer glances at the paperwork.

                            RELEASE OFFICER
               Yep- Morris- we got him right here
               waiting.

     CLANK-CLANG. The door begins to open as the Officer
     stamps some of the paperwork.

                            RELEASE OFFICER (CONT'D)
               And you are--?

                            STEVEN
               I'm his lawyer.

     Phillip runs into his arms. As they kiss, the officer
     offers a surprised look.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   51.


                            PHILLIP
               You're incredible.

                              STEVEN
               I know.


83   INT. PASSABLE APARTMENT, 1995 - HOUSTON - NIGHT             83

     A PARTY to celebrate Phillip's release. Steven and
     Phillip stand at the door as FRIENDS file in and greet
     him boisterously.

                               BAYLOR
               Phillllip!     It's so good to see you...

     Another friend enters.

                            BLAKE
               Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed
               with you. How do I get on that diet?

                            PHILLIP
               Oh you couldn't handle it- not unless we
               smuggled an espresso machine in a cake.

                            BLAKE
               Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I'm
               there!

                            PHILLIP
               This is Steven. Steven- Blake and Baylor.

                            BLAKE
               (Gasp) This is him?! This is your gay
               lawyer prison boyfriend?! Pleased to
               meet you.

                            BAYLOR
               Much better than the guy who had you
               kidnapped. What was his name?

     Steven looks to Phillip, perplexed.

                              PHILLIP
               Long story.

                            STEVEN
                      (regroups, to others)
               Can I get you all a drink?
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    52.


84   INT. PASSABLE APARTMENT KITCHEN, 1995 - LATER THAT NIGHT 84

     Steven works his way through the crowded apartment
     struggling to hold a few cocktail glasses for guests.

     He eventually arrives next to Phillip, who is having a
     great time with another friend- and older woman named
     EUDORA MIXON.

                            STEVEN
               We gotta get a bigger place.

                            PHILLIP
               Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor-
               Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest.

                            EUDORA
               Pleasure Steven.

                            STEVEN
               Eudora...

                            PHILLIP
               Eudora owns a little building in Montrose
               and she's having a hell of time with the
               builder. He sounds like a real asshole.

                            EUDORA
               His plans were useless and he's trying to
               sue me to pay him! I need your expertise
               Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help.

                            STEVEN
               I could certainly try.

                            EUDORA
               Can you still practice law, having been
               to prison?

                            STEVEN
               Sure- why not?

                            EUDORA
               I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd
               just be glad to have someone I could
               trust. I'll pay your normal fee.

     Steven doesn't miss a beat. He smiles wide.

                            STEVEN
               It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my
               speciality.

     Phillip beams with pride over Steven's decision.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   53.


85   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, 1995 - DAY               85

     Eudora waits on a bench in the corridor, nervously
     glancing at her watch. Steven stands behind a column
     down the hall hiding and watching. He looks at his
     watch, then approaches her.

                            STEVEN
               Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in
               court all day. Let's go in.


86   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM, 1995 - DAY                         86

     STEVEN'S POV: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT
     FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling.

     ON STEVEN, staring up at it with admiration.

                            JUDGE (O.S.)
               Mister Russell?

     Steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting JUDGE.

                            STEVEN
               It's a beautiful fixture.

                             JUDGE
               I know.   It's your turn.

                            STEVEN
               Oh...
                      (then)
               Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage
               service in good faith and was given an
               inferior product. She is entitled to deem
               that work to be unacceptable according to
               the contract that Mr. Evans signed.

                            LAWYER
               The terms of that contract were ambiguous
               at best. The truth is, defendant engaged
               my client for three years without full
               payment.

                            STEVEN
               Your honor I have, in my briefcase,
               fourteen other contracts, all on public
               record, in which Mr. Evans entered into
               litigation with past clients of his!

     Eudora glances into Steven's opened BRIEFCASE. It
     contains only a SANDWICH and a PHOTO OF PHILLIP.
     "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   54.


     The shocked LAWYER turns to his client (EVANS).

                            LAWYER
                      (whispers)
               Is this true?

                            EVANS
               No.

                            LAWYER
               You're making me look like an idiot.

     He regroups and addresses the judge.

                            LAWYER (CONT'D)
               Your honor, I don't have to tell you that
               none of this is admissable or applicable
               to the case at hand. Mr. Russell's
               histrionics do not erase the fact that
               his client is in breech of contract.

                            JUDGE
               He is right Mr. Russell- what do you have
               to say?

     Steven is stonewalled. He looks to Eudora as if to say,
     "What do I do now?" and it terrifies her.

     Desperate, Steven bangs his fist on the table and looks
     resolutely to the judge.

                            STEVEN
               I demand to be seen in chambers!!

     The judge and lawyer seem mystified by this response.

                            JUDGE
               Okaaaaaaaay...


87   INT. HOUSTON JUDGE'S CHAMBERS, 1995 - DAY                  87

     The Lawyer sits impatiently while Steven peruses a wall
     of plaques, photos and diplomas. He focuses on a law
     school DEGREE from INDIANA COLLEGE OF LAW. Next to it, a
     PHOTO of the judge as a YOUNG MAN on a farm. He's from
     humble roots.

     A moment later, the Judge enters.

                            JUDGE
               Okay gentlemen, let's get this over with,
               the two for one at the Crab Boiler ends
               at five o'clock.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   55.


                       LAWYER
          This seems to be cut and dried here, sir.
          I don't even know why we're back here.
          Mister Russell is treating this like an
          episode of Matlock.

                       STEVEN
          I'll admit your honor- I'm a plain spoken
          man. I didn't go to Princeton. I didn't
          go to Yale. My education was modest. I
          went to a small school. I grew up on a
          small farm. But I passed the same bar
          exam as my colleague here and I am not
          going to let him push around this humble
          woman.

This scores with the judge.

                       JUDGE
          Point taken Mister Russell...

He glares at the other lawyer with scorn.

                       JUDGE (CONT'D)
          ...but where are you going with this?

                       STEVEN
          I think it's obvious where I'm going with
          this sir.

A long SILENCE. The Judge waits and waits until something
occurs to him.

                       JUDGE
          Are you talking about Marshall vs. Chao?

Steven doesn't know what this means... But the other
lawyer does. And he's not happy.

                       LAWYER
                 (sotto)
          Shit...

Seeing this, Steven puffs with confidence.

                       STEVEN
          Your honor, that's exactly what I'm
          talking about.

The Judge slowly nods to himself as he considers this.

                                              SMASH CUT TO:

88   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, 1995 - DAY                 88

     Outside the courtroom with Eudora, Steven is ecstatic.

                            STEVEN
               YES! I did great! Can you believe how
               great I did!?

                             EUDORA
                      (wary)
               Yes. You did very well, Steven. Thank
               you.

                            STEVEN
               I mean, I did great! Really great! I'm so
               proud of myself! You want half my
               sandwich?!

                            EUDORA
               Um...

                            STEVEN
               No! We're going out!    I'm paying!!


89   INT. NEW HOUSTON APARTMENT, 1996 - DAY                       89

     Phillip stands flabbergasted next to Steven in the middle
     of a large modern apartment.

                            PHILLIP
               Oh my God, it's amazing.

                            STEVEN
               I thought you'd like it honey.

                            PHILLIP
               Can we afford this?

                            STEVEN
               You let me worry about the money
               sweetheart.

                            PHILLIP
               Okay, well I guess I better start packing
               boxes.

                            STEVEN
               Not this weekend.

                            PHILLIP
               Why not?

                             STEVEN
                I think we both need a vacation. Key
                West?

     Phillip smiles.

91   I/E. KEY WEST COVE - 1996 - VARIOUS                         91

     PALM TREES undulate on the constant breeze, inviting us
     to a beautifully solitary cove. Eventually Steven and
     Phillip's voices are heard.

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                I've been meaning to ask you something.

                            STEVEN (O.S.)
                Yeah?

     DIALOGUE CONTINUES OVER VARIOUS SHOTS of their romantic
     getaway to the Keys. In a SERIES of SHOTS we see where
     they've been and what they've been doing in the moments
     AFTER they've been there.

     - A Hammock blowing in the breeze.

     - A quaint COTTAGE nestled in the vegetation.

     - Half empty glasses of beer on the porch.

     - Dirty dishes in the cottage sink. The remains of a
     romantic meal on a table. The swaying palms are visible
     through the windows.

     - Footsteps in the sand.

     - Two beach chairs facing the surf.

     - Etc...   etc...

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                That birthday cake you got me in the pen?
                Where'd you get those candles?

                             STEVEN (O.S.)
                Oh you know... just... people I knew.

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                Yeah, I know. But how?
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   58.


                             STEVEN (O.S.)
                Remember that guard? Skinny guy? Smoked a
                lot?

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                Lance? He couldn't been more than 98
                pounds.

                             STEVEN (O.S.)
                Yeah, that's him.

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                Oh he was such an asshole.

                             STEVEN (O.S.)
                Actually- I was in the yard once. Another
                guard asked him to pay him back five. He
                opened his wallet and I saw this picture
                of a little girl about Steffie's age. So
                I brought it up to him once, just to get
                him talking. That's the thing about
                having kids, you know? Gets people
                talking. Shared experience. Builds
                bridges. Something I learned. Anyway he
                tells me he's worried about her- mamma
                was gone. We talked awhile. You know, I
                just listened. That's all. I brought up
                the candles just one time but mostly just
                listened... And the next day, bedtime,
                there they were.


91A   EXT. PALM BEACH COVE - 1996 - DUSK - CONTINUOUS            91A

      The dialogue continues on the beach as we finally see
      Steven and Phillip enjoying the sunset by the light of a
      small fire on the beach.

                             PHILLIP
                How'd you know he'd do that?

                             STEVEN
                I didn't. I just knew I wanted `em for
                you... and I found a way to do it. That's
                all.

      Phillip smiles, eyes never leaving the sunset.

                             PHILLIP
                Just listenin' huh?

                               STEVEN
                That's it...

     And as the sun sets on the shimmering water--


92   EXT. OCEAN, 1996 - DAY                                      92

     An empty 21-foot MOTORBOAT bobs atop placid seas, fishing
     poles dangling over the side. The SOUND of two men
     enjoying themselves can be heard.

     After reaching their inevitable conclusion, the VOICES
     gasp for air.

                            PHILLIP (O.S.)
                      (winded)
               I'm gonna get a Coke... you want a Coke?

                              STEVEN (O.S.)
               Uh huh...                                              *

     Phillip spits something over the railing...                      *

                            STEVEN (CONT'D)                           *
               Aw, you don't love me...                               *

     And as Phillip smiles and wipe his chin.                         *

                            STEVEN (V.O.)
               With Phillip I felt strong. I felt
               invincible. I promised myself he would
               never want for anything ever again. That
               meant I needed a real job. Something
               dependable. And- no more scams.

                                                         FADE IN:


96   INT. USAMM HQ - LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY              96

     A bored Steven waits in the middle of a big wig's office.
     He looks at PHOTOS on a nearby wall of a broad-shouldered
     all-American man dressed in a NASA jump suit performing
     various astronautical training tasks.

     He picks up a small ASTRONAUT FIGURINE and examines it.

                            LINDHOLM (O.S.)
               Sorry to keep you waiting Steven.

     Steven turns to find Dan Lindholm, the broad-shouldered
     man himself.

                            LINDHOLM   (CONT'D)
               I'm Dan Lindholm.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   60.


                       STEVEN
          Were you a spaceman?

                        LINDHOLM
          Yep. Never got out there though. NASA's
          a real political place. Never could
          figure out whose ass to kiss to get a
          mission.
                 (then)
          All in the past. Barely even think about
          it now...

CUT TO REVEAL a HUGE MODEL of the SPACE SHUTTLE that
engulfs half the room. Steven puts the figurine back.

                       STEVEN
          A spaceman, huh? How do you crap up
          there?

                       LINDHOLM
          Ass gasket.
                 (draws on his coffee)
          Have a seat.

Steven sits across the desk from Lindholm .

                        LINDHOLM (CONT'D)
          With the popularity of HMO's in today's
          health care system, doctors need help
          managing their billing-- so they can
          focus on their patients. That's where
          USA Medical Management comes in. Hundreds
          of millions of dollars pass through our
          system from the HMO's to the doctors.
          It's a critical business. A powerful
          business...
                 (beat)
          So when I read your resume, I wasn't sure
          what to think. Your level of education
          and your past experience would factor
          heavily into this decision and frankly...

Steven deflates in expectation.

                       LINDHOLM (CONT'D)
          ...you were head and shoulders above the
          rest. I mean, I could hardly believe it.
          But when I called your references-- well
          they couldn't speak more highly of you.

97   INT. NEW HOUSTON APARTMENT KITCHEN - 1996 - DAY            97

     Steven makes breakfast in his tightie-whities while
     talking on the phone. Phillip is in the background doing
     a crossword puzzle at the kitchen table.

                            STEVEN
               I could not speak more highly of Steven
               Russell, Mr. Lindholm . A real straight
               shooter. We were damn lucky to have him
               at Prudential as long as we did.

     In his own world, Phillip chimes in.

                            PHILLIP
               Brando's wet debut?

     Steven covers the phone with his hand.

                            STEVEN
               On the Waterfront.

                                                       BACK TO:


98   INT. LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        98

     Dan continues to wax on about Steven.

                            LINDHOLM
               Employee of the year two years running?
               Developing software with IBM? You're the
               kind of people we need here Steven. We
               want you as our Chief Financial Officer.
               So what do you say? I want your answer
               right now. C'mon Steven- let's light
               this candle.

     As Steven pretends to mull--


99   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  99

     An uptight assistant (RHEBA) leads Steven into his fancy
     new office.

                            RHEBA
               ...for example "he's in a meeting" sounds
               better than "he's away from his desk" at
               least I think so, but whatever you
               prefer.

                            STEVEN
               That's fine... sure.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08   62.


      She leads him to his new desk which is stacked with
      folders, files, printouts and reams of data.

                              RHEBA
                I pulled all the claims for the last two
                years as well as the statements,
                transfers and confirmations from the
                bank. Most of it's routine and I think
                you can get up to speed in a day or two.
                       (then)
                Anything else I can do for you?

                             STEVEN
                Uh.... cup of coffee?

                             RHEBA
                I'll do it today but I don't do that
                really.

      Steven nods and turns his attention to the sea of numbers
      before him. He looks concerned as he begins to leaf
      through.


100   INT. USAMM BOARDROOM - 1996 - DAY                         100

      Steven sits in a board meeting, surrounded by all of the
      company honchos. Dan Lindholm lords over the gathering
      at the head of the table while a suit (MARK) reads from a
      report to the group.

                             MARK
                Crossover from traditional markets shows
                declination and inverse diffusion seems
                commensurate with net-trade trending. HMO
                penetration still leads PPO, NMO and FMO
                as usual but attenuation is growing more
                prevalent in Q4 as projected... As for
                Q3, well Q3 is what Q3 always is: Q2 with
                training wheels.

      Everyone LAUGHS, but no one quite as hard as Steven who
      desperately tries to fit in.

      Larry Birkheim, the CEO of USAMM sits beside Dan
      Lindholm. He chimes in.

                             BIRKHEIM
                Okay Steven, your turn. I know you've
                only had the one quarter to play catch up
                but I tell you, we can't wait to get some
                insight here.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages    5-23-08    63.


                       STEVEN
          Sure. What about?

                       BIRKHEIM
          Mark's projections.

                        STEVEN
          Mmm hm.   Sure.

                       BIRKHEIM
          They seem kind of flat.

                        STEVEN
          Oh.   Okay. Ummm...

Steven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Well I did a lot of work here and uh... I
          think maybe... well I could just read it
          to you but uh... it might be better to
          just uh...

The group looks at him quizzically.     Just as it seems
Steven has been up to nothing--

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Well, I'll just show you. Todd?

TODD, an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full
of detailed tables. Steven walks the board through an
incredibly well prepared presentation.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          If you look here at Mark's projections
          again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see
          they're just that- projections.
          Projections based on a model set by my
          predecessor. I decided to reject that
          model and do things a little differently.
          I want to show you my results. This is
          what we actually made in Q3--

Todd flips to the next card. The graphs GROW
exponentially. The group is intrigued.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Now let me tell you how I did it...

Todd unveils another card, the men are impressed by the
unseen image.

And as Steven explains himself, Dan and Birkheim smile
broadly and turn to each other with smug assurance.

101   INT. NEW APARTMENT KITCHEN - 1996 - NIGHT                  101

      OPEN CLOSE on a candy wrapper opening. A hand removes
      the candy revealing an INSPIRING MESSAGE printed inside
      the wrapper- "When two hearts race, both win."

      ON PHILLIP. He's deeply touched by the sentiment as he
      chews on the candy. He puts the wrapper on the
      REFRIGERATOR with a MAGNET.

      He opens ANOTHER. He chews and reads- "Commit random acts
      of kindness"

      Again he's touched and puts it on the refrigerator.

      He opens ANOTHER and pops the candy in his mouth.    He
      reads- "A smile is a flower on your face"

      He's disgusted by the trite sentiment and THROWS THE
      WRAPPER IN THE TRASH. A beat later, he REMOVES THE CANDY
      from his mouth and THROWS THAT IN THE TRASH TOO.

      Just then Steven walks by in a TUXEDO, adjusting his tie.

                             PHILLIP
                The tux? Where are you going?

                             STEVEN
                It's just a work thing. Were we supposed
                to--

                             PHILLIP
                No- I just thought- it's fine. Where you
                going?

                             STEVEN
                Some stupid gala ball thing...

                             PHILLIP
                Gala? Oh...
                       (playing it off)
                Sounds boring.

                              STEVEN
                Yeah.   I'll be home early.   Promise.


102   INT. HOUSTON BALLROOM - 1996 - NIGHT                       102

      A black-tie cocktail party is in full swing. Steven eats
      a canapé by a window. Something outside catches his eye.

103   EXT. HOUSTON BALLROOM BALCONY, 1996 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 103

      Dan Lindholm is out on the balcony staring up at the
      starry sky. Steven approaches.

                             LINDHOLM
                You see that?

      Dan points out a small dot of light moving across the
      sky. Steven squints.

                             STEVEN
                No...
                       (realizing)
                Oh- is it...?

                             LINDHOLM
                Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right
                now. Just a satellite deployment.
                Nothing special... Just touching the face
                of God.

      He chokes back a tear, then throws an arm around Steven.

                             LINDHOLM (CONT'D)
                I want you to meet my wife.


104   INT. HOUSTON BALLROOM, 1996 - NIGHT                        104

      Dan Lindholm escorts Steven to BEVERLY Lindholm and a
      ghastly gaggle of Texas society WIVES.

                             LINDHOLM
                Bev- Ladies- I want you to meet Steven
                Russell, our CFO.

                             MRS. LINDHOLM
                Oh I heard about you.

                             STEVEN
                Good things I hope.

                             MRS. LINDHOLM
                Yes and no. Don's bellyaching about how
                big your Christmas bonus is gonna be
                because you're making him so much money.

      A GIGGLE infects the group. Another WIFE speaks up.

                             FACELIFT WIFE
                Are you married Steven?

                             STEVEN
                Uh... engaged.

                             BLONDE WIFE
                Well where is she, sweetheart?

                             STEVEN
                She works. Travels a lot.     It's killing
                her she couldn't be here.

      And as the wives fret symathetically-


105   INT. USAMM OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                            105

      Steven saunters over to VERA the company accountant who
      is stamping some checks. He places some papers on her
      desk.

                             STEVEN
                These are ready for Dan ...

                             VERA
                Thanks Steven. You doin' good?

                             STEVEN
                Kind of. I just got back from my lawyer's
                office. I asked him, "What's your fee?"
                He says, "I charge $50 for three
                questions." So I ask, "Don't you think
                that's a little expensive?" And he says,
                "Yes it is... Now what's your final
                question?"

      Vera EXPLODES with laughter.

                             VERA
                It's so true. Lawyers!

      She turns to a colleague.

                             VERA (CONT'D)
                Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this!


106   INT. UPSCALE HOUSTON RESTAURANT - 1996 - DAY              106

      Steven sits at a high powered lunch with Dan Lindholm and
      Larry Birkheim. He is diligently taking notes.

                             BIRKHEIM
                That's the thing about the back nine at
                Pebble Beach.

                I don't care what your handicap is...
                that sand wedge is gonna get a workout-

                             LINDHOLM
                I couldn't agree with you more. I
                remember one time, I was at Augusta...

      As Dan prattles on, Steven continues to write on his
      pad. CUT TO REVEAL he's doodling pictures of SMILEY-
      FACED PENISES.


107   INT. USAMM - BREAK ROOM - 1996 - DAY                       107

      Steven refills his mug of coffee while in the background,
      two SECRETARIES dish.

                             SECRETARY
                The woman says,"That's awful expensive,
                isn't it?" and the lawyer says, "Yes and
                now you only got one question left!"

      She laughs LOUDER than the woman listening to the joke.

                             SECRETARY (CONT'D)
                `Cause he already asked the two!

      They both laugh loudly now as Steven exits.


108   INT. HOUSTON BANQUET ROOM - 1996 - DAY                     108

      Steven and Dan Lindholm stand at the omelette station at
      a high class brunch buffet.

                             LINDHOLM
                       (to cook)
                Mushroom and cheese.
                       (to Steven)
                Anyway like I was saying the Northrup guy
                says to the NASA "well that question's
                gonna cost fifty million to answer" so
                NASA says, "Don't you think that's a lot
                of money?" and Northrup says "Yep, now
                you owe us another fifty million. Next
                question please!"

      This sounds eerily familiar. Steven laughs a COURTESY
      LAUGH.

                             STEVEN
                Yeah that's a good one...

                              LINDHOLM
                That's why there's so few shuttle
                missions. They're wasting all their
                money on bureaucracy. And probes...
                Unmanned probes.
                       (then)
                Like people care if there's life on Mars.

109   INT. NEW HOUSTON APARTMENT, 1996 - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 109

      Phillip test his blood sugar by applying a test strip to
      his bloody thumb. He compares the strip to small card
      with a blood sugar chart.

      Contented with the result, he puts the everything away in
      a small BLACK LEATHER BAG containing INSULIN and
      SYRINGES.

      Steven passes by in the BACKGROUND with a brand new bag
      of golf clubs. Phillip is instantly puzzled.

                             PHILLIP
                Golf!?

                             STEVEN
                What?

                             PHILLIP
                You're a homosexual.

                             STEVEN
                It's work.

                             PHILLIP
                You know, you can tell them.    They can't
                fire you for being gay.

                             STEVEN
                I know...

                             PHILLIP
                I'm trying to be understanding here
                honey, but golf? Why not just eat pussy?

                             STEVEN
                       (exiting)
                Wish me luck.

110   EXT. HOUSTON GOLF COURSE - 1996 - DAY                      110

      Steven, Lindholm and two CLIENTS are at the first tee.

      Steven nervously tees up. He does his best recollection
      of a warm up and hits the ball. It's not a good drive,
      but it does go about thirty yards.

                             STEVEN
                Oh! This is easy!
                       (cocky, Butch)
                Your turn Dan!


111   EXT. HOUSTON GOLF COURSE SANDTRAP - 1996 - LATER           111

      As Lindholm and the Clients wait, a periodic spray of
      sand flies up from the trap behind them as unseen Steven
      swings in vain.

                             LINDHOLM
                Hell of a hazard ain't it Steven?

      Eventually, a ball flies out of the trap.

                             STEVEN (O.S.)
                       (to ball)
                Oh yeah! How ya like that, sister!?

                                                           CUT TO:


112   EXT. HOUSTON GOLF COURSE FAIRWAY - 1996 - DAY              112

      Steven and the Client amble along a few yards behind Dan
      and the other client. Steven is covered in sweat and
      sand.

                             CLIENT
                So the black fella says to the jew lawyer-
                "50 bucks a question? Ain't that
                expensive?" "Yeah it's expensive," he
                says, "I'm a Jew, you nigger!"

      The man laughs to himself.

                              CLIENT (CONT'D)
                Get it?!!

      He soon spots his ball up ahead.

                              CLIENT (CONT'D)
                There I am.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   70.


      He moves on, leaving Steven standing there, disgusted.

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:


113   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  113

      Steven sits at his desk, detached and fed up.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                Maybe it was because it's just my nature,
                or maybe it was because of my past... or
                maybe it was because they were the most
                boring fucking people I'd ever met in my
                life...
                       (beat)
                Whatever the reason, I had been robbing
                them blind for months.


114   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  114

      FLASHBACK to Steven's first day on the job as his RHEBA
      escorts him to a desk piled high with financial reports.

                             RHEBA
                Anything else I can do for you?

                             STEVEN
                Uh.... cup of coffee?

                             RHEBA
                I'll do it today but I don't do that
                really.

      Steven nods and begins to leaf through various folders.

      It isn't long before something catches his eye.


115   MONTAGE: HOW MONEY FLOWS AT USAMM--                        115

      QUICK CUTS of Steven researching by leafing through
      folders and files INTERCUT with a slow push in on a CHECK
      PRINTING MACHINE as it spits out product as well as TIME
      LAPSE footage of employees buzzing through one of the
      USAM hallways.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                The thing about U-SAMM was that they took
                in all this HMO money and distributed it
                to doctors.

                             STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                But in the time between receiving the
                money and paying it out- it was just
                sitting there, not making interest or
                anything.


116   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                 116

      At his desk, Steven leafs through the company finances.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                It occurred to me to set up an investment
                account where the held money would earn
                interest for the short time that the
                company had it. We're talking twenty two
                million at any given time here, so even
                short term the interest adds up pretty
                quickly. I'd be making the company
                millions virtually overnight.

      He leans back to think to himself.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                ...and I of course would take a
                commission. Say... fifty percent. The
                only problem with that was-- I wasn't the
                one signing the checks.


117   INT. USAMM OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                            117

      OPEN CLOSE on a check being signature-stamped with a
      RUBBER STAMP. A hand places the stamp into a small wooden
      box and closes it.

      CUT WIDE to reveal the hand belongs to VERA, the company
      accountant and STEVEN is standing over her. It is now we
      realize we are revisiting an earlier scene.

                             STEVEN
                So I ask, "Don't you think that's a
                little expensive?" and the lawyer says,
                "Yes it is, now what's your final
                question?"

      Vera EXPLODES with laughter.

                             VERA
                It's so true. Lawyers!

      She turns to a colleague.

                             VERA (CONT'D)
                Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this!
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08    72.


      And as ANNIE comes over, Steven's hand moves to the
      wooden box and secretly plucks the RUBBER STAMP.


118   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  118

      Lindholm raps on the open door as he enters.

                             LINDHOLM
                Steven, we got a problem. Vera lost that
                stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is
                a goddamned disaster and she's the o-ring
                if you know what I'm saying.

                              STEVEN
                       (faux)
                Oh... how long till we can get a new one?

                             LINDHOLM
                Nope. Time to overhaul the program. I got
                a computerized system already on order.
                No more room for pilot error.

      Steven hangs his head, visibly disappointed.

                             LINDHOLM (CONT'D)
                Should be up and running in a couple
                months. I want you signing the checks
                until then.

      Steven brightens up suddenly.

                             STEVEN
                Really?! Great!

                             LINDHOLM
                You play golf?

                             STEVEN
                Uhhh... yeah. Sure.


119   EXT. HOUSTON SUBURB - NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY               119

      A huge MOVING TRUCK is parked before an impressive house
      in an upscale neighborhood. MOVERS unload and roll
      dollies past two matching MERCEDES COUPES.

      Steven and Phillip oversee the work- each holding
      matching MINIATURE PINCERS.

      They smile wide.   Moments later an OFFSCREEN HONK gets
      their attention.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   73.


      They look to see a SPORTING GOODS TRUCK pulling up with
      two JET-SKIS hitched to a trailer.

                             PHILLIP
                       (wowed)
                How big was this Christmas bonus?

                             STEVEN
                       (covering)
                Pretty big.

                             PHILLIP
                In July?

      Phillip is slightly suspicious.


120   I/E. NEW HOUSE / BACKYARD - 1996 - MORNING                 120

      Various vignettes of Steven and Phillip's new home.

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                       (mid-story)
                The sheriff is desperate and goes to a
                psychic. All the woman says is rabbit.
                Rabbit-rabbit-rabbit, that's all. Well
                he thinks `bullshit' and he's driving
                back home and what happens? He sees a
                rabbit crossing the street in front of
                him. So he pulls over and follows it into
                the woods and he finds the missing car.
                All wrecked and turned over and the
                girl's inside... still alive.

      Eventually we find Steven and Phillip in the BACKYARD on
      a large DOUBLE CHAISE LOUNGE. Their sleeping min-pins
      are between them.

                             STEVEN
                No.

                             PHILLIP
                I swear. It's in the Ricky Martin People
                in the bathroom.

      Steven smiles and cuddles up.

                             PHILLIP (CONT'D)
                Yeah... they can find out all sorts of
                stuff, those people.

                             STEVEN
                Mmm hmm...
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   74.


                              PHILLIP
                They can find out anything about
                anyone... anything.
                       (then)
                They could even find out something about
                you...

      Steven grows suspicious.

                             STEVEN
                Phillip... what is it?

                             PHILLIP
                It's just-- Is something going on?
                Something you're not telling me?

                               STEVEN
                No.

                             PHILLIP
                Because if there is, stop now.

                               STEVEN
                There isn't.    There's nothing.

                             PHILLIP
                I don't care about the money, the house,
                jet-skis- all I want is you. I just want
                us to be together.

                              STEVEN
                We're always going to be together. And
                there is nothing going on. I promise.
                       (then)
                I wouldn't lie to you, baby.

      Steven stares back and convinces Phillip with a look.
      They kiss.


121   INT. USAMM PARKING GARAGE - 1996 - DAY                     121

      Birkheim emerges from his parked MERCEDES C-CLASS. After
      locking it he notices a little smudge and buffs it out
      with his handkerchief.

      As he admires his car proudly, the building volume of the
      MIAMI SOUND MACHINE gets his attention.

      He sees as Steven arrives in his NEW and MUCH MORE
      IMPRESSIVE SL500 and parks a few spots down.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"        Green Pages   5-23-08   75.


      He watches as Steven tries on several watches and tosses
      them back in the glove compartment before settling on one
      and exiting the car.

      Birkheim raises a brow.


122   INT. USAMM ELEVATOR - 1996 - A SHORT TIME LATER             122

      Birkheim and Steven share the elevator.

                                BIRKHEIM
                Nice car.

                             STEVEN
                Thanks, Larry.

                             BIRKHEIM
                Which one is it?

                              STEVEN
                SL.   That the C you're driving?

                                BIRKHEIM
                Yeah.

                                STEVEN
                Good car.

                                BIRKHEIM
                Mmm hm.

                                STEVEN
                Good value.

      DING! The door opens. Steven exits, leaving a disgruntled
      Birkheim in his wake.


123   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                         123

      Birkheim pores over spreadsheets, taking notes and
      comparing numbers. CLOSE UPS on headings like "INTEREST
      EARNED" and "DEPOSIT" indicate he's looking for something

      He continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious
      until something catches his eye.

      In the margin of one of the pages is a DOODLING of a
      SMILEY-FACED PENIS.

      Birkheim doesn't quite know what to make of this... but
      it seems to stare at him mockingly.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    76.


124   INT. USAMM HALLWAY - 1996 - DAY                            124

      Steven whistles happily and takes a draw off his coffee
      mug. As he passes an office, something catches his ear.

                             BIRKHEIM (O.S.)
                I have some questions about these new
                accounts we've opened.

      Steven slows to a stop.


125   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - CONTINUOUS                 125

      Birkheim, his back to the door, is on the phone as Steven
      eavesdrops outside.

                             BIRKHEIM
                Yeah... I was wondering if we could
                compare some numbers. I know you usually
                talk to our CFO but this is a delicate
                matter and I'd like keep it secret for
                now.

      Steven is worried.


126   INT. USAMM CUBICLE - 1996 - DAY                            126

      OPEN CLOSE on blank copies spitting out of a copier.
      Steven stands over the machine, his finger on the button
      as he keeps surveillance on Birkheim's office door.

      A SECRETARY arrives with a stack of papers.

                             SECRETARY
                Hi Mister Ru--

                             STEVEN
                I'M MAKING COPIES!!!

      She leaves, terrified.

      Finally, Steven spots Birkheim leaving his office.


127   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        127

      Steven runs into Birkheim's office and scans the papers
      on his desk. Nothing.

      He turns his attention to Birkheim's briefcase, but he
      can't get it open.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08     77.


      Eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it
      closely. He grabs a pencil and does the old detective
      trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written
      on the now missing page above.

      The embossed text reads, "837,502.12"

      He stares at it a moment. This number looks familiar.
      He grabs the phone and dials. An AUTOMATED VOICE answers.

                             AUTOMATED TELLER
                Hello, you've reached the Automatic
                Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please
                enter your personal account number
                followed by the pound sign.

      Steven quickly enters some numbers. As he listens he
      flips through Birkheim's desktop calendar.

                             AUTOMATED TELLER (CONT'D)
                Thank you. Your account balance is eight
                hundred-thirty seven thousand five
                hundred and two dollars and twelve cents.
                To repeat this-

      It's the SAME NUMBER as on the pad. He hangs up. And
      turns his attention to the calendar. He spies an entry
      that reads, "Harris County Police, 12:30"

      He leaps out of the chair and exits the office.


128   INT. USAMM COPIER ROOM - 1996 - DAY                        128

      Steven furiously shreds documents in the company's PAPER
      SHREDDER. Moments later the same SECRETARY enters the
      room with an armload of work- enraging Steven.

                             STEVEN
                CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SHREDDING!?

      Terrified, the woman runs away.


129   EXT. BANK - DAY                                            129

      OPEN CLOSE on an ATM keypad as Steven punches some keys
      and retrieves a handful of cash. He stuffs it into his
      breast pocket and hops back into his SL.


130   INT. DEBBIE'S HOME - NIGHT                                 130

      The phone RINGS. Debbie answers.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages   5-23-08   78.


                              DEBBIE
                Hello?


131   INT. MERCEDES SL (DRIVING) - GULF FREEWAY, 1996 - DAY     131

      INTERCUT. Steven is on the phone while driving with the
      top down.

                              STEVEN
                Hey Debbie.

                             DEBBIE
                Steven. How are you?

                             STEVEN
                Good. How's Steffie doing?

                             DEBBIE
                Good. Real good. She sure is your
                daughter...

                             STEVEN
                She's interested in boys already?

                              DEBBIE
                Ha-ha.   How's Phillip?

                             STEVEN
                He's good. He says hi, but listen- I
                just wanted to call and let you know I'm
                switching all my phone numbers. I'll let
                you know when we get a new one.

                             DEBBIE
                Oh Steven, are you on the lam again?

                             STEVEN
                Deb, you always knew me best.

                             DEBBIE
                Steven you really should stop all this,
                you are such a good man and I know that
                Jesus has a plan for you.

                             STEVEN
                Well, maybe this is his plan.

                             DEBBIE
                Now don't start.

      A CALL-WAITING TONE is heard.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   79.


                             STEVEN
                Anyway Debbie- that's my boss calling. I
                love you both and I'll call you soon.

      Steven clicks over to the other line.

                               STEVEN (CONT'D)
                Hello?


132   INT. LINDHOLM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        132

      INTERCUT with Lindholm on the phone, with Birkheim in the
      background, spreadsheets in hand.

                             LINDHOLM
                Steven? Where are you?

                             STEVEN
                The Gulf Freeway. Where are you?

                             LINDHOLM
                At the office. You coming back anytime
                soon?

                             STEVEN
                Is something wrong?

                             LINDHOLM
                No, we just want to see you Steven. We
                miss you is what it is.

                             STEVEN
                Oh, that's nice Dan. But I don't think
                I'm coming back in. I think we both know
                why.

                             LINDHOLM
                You sure about that Steven?

                               STEVEN
                Bye-bye Dan.

      Steven hangs up.


133   INT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                                133

      Steven storms into the house, panting. A worried Phillip
      comes to greet him.

                             PHILLIP
                People keep calling, what's going on?
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    80.


      Steven starts pulling wads of money out of every
      available pocket and piling it on the kitchen table.

                             STEVEN
                Nothing. Thought we'd take a little
                vacation. Key West. Let's pack. Quick!
                Okay I'll pack for you!

      Phillip follows him through the house.

                             PHILLIP
                I fucking knew it- you did do something.
                You lied to me! You looked me right in
                the eye and lied!

                             STEVEN
                Now don't get angry, it's gonna be fun, I
                swear.

                             PHILLIP
                Are you going back to jail? Steven, you
                promised we'd always be together!

                             STEVEN
                Of course we are! We're never gonna be
                apart. Never.

      Steven ducks into the bedroom.   Phillip doesn't follow.

                             PHILLIP
                You lying son of a bitch! You took
                advantage of me! Just like all the rest!
                SON OF A BITCH!


134   INT. NEW HOUSE BEDROOM - 1996 - CONTINUOUS                 134

      Steven furiously packs a suitcase, yelling out to Phillip
      in the hallway.

                             STEVEN
                We'll get a place. Do some fishing. I can
                work on my key lime pie recipe...

      Steven picks up the suitcase without zipping it up and
      heads back into the hall.

                             STEVEN (CONT'D)
                ...I might even grow a beard and enter
                the Papa Hemingway contest!

      He stops short in the hallway.   Phillip is gone.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   81.


                             STEVEN (CONT'D)
                Phillip? Honey?


135   EXT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                              135

      Steven bursts from the house still clutching the suitcase
      just in time to see Phillip's car rounding the corner.

                             STEVEN
                COME BACK! WAIT!


136   INT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                              136

      He re-enters, emptying the suitcase along the way. He
      then proceeds to fill it with the cash on the table.


137   EXT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                              137

      Steven exits and heads for his car, but before he can get
      in-

      WHAM! He's grabbed by a group of POLICEMEN. He SQUEALS
      like a rabbit's death bleat and flails wildly.

      This continues for a while until--

                                                    SMASH CUT TO:


138   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY          138

      Steven resumes his VOICE OVER in the penitentiary
      infirmary.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                There I was, keeping secrets, living a
                lie. Like I said, I tend to do that. Now
                I didn't blame Phillip for running out on
                me, but I had to make things right. I had
                to get him back. You see, there's
                something I didn't tell you...
                       (beat)
                ...it's about my old boyfriend. Do you
                remember him? His name was Jimmy.

                                                          CUT TO:

139   INT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1991 - MORNING                  139

      The Florida sun bathes the bedroom in a heavenly glow,
      illuminating Jimmy Kemple as he wakes. He opens his eyes
      to see Steven staring longingly at him.

                               KEMPLE
                   What?

      Steven just smiles.

                               KEMPLE (CONT'D)
                   What?

                                STEVEN
                   I love you Jimmy.

      Kemple smirks.

                                KEMPLE
                   It's only been a month, Steven.

                               STEVEN
                   I know.

                                KEMPLE
                   Don't fall for me Steven.

                                STEVEN
                   Why the hell not?

                                KEMPLE
                   You know damn well why.

      Steven thinks a moment, but never stops smiling.

                                STEVEN
                   I don't give a shit about that.

      They kiss.


140   EXT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL PARKING STRUCTURE - 1992 - DAY 140

      FLASHBACK. We're back at the scene where Steven tries to
      jump in the dumpster. He leaps over the guard rail and--

                               KEMPLE
                   STEVEN!

      WHAM!!! Steven hits the ground next to the dumpster.

141   EXT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL PARKING STRUCTURE - 1992 - DAY 141

      A short time later, Steven lies MOANING and delirious.
      Kemple cradles his head as Debbie and the cop watch
      nearby.

                             KEMPLE
                You need to do the time. I'll wait for
                you. I will. I'll wait for you. I
                promise. I love you. I'll wait for you.


142   INT. MIAMI JAIL - CELL BLOCK - 1993 - DAY                   142

      Steven pushes a cart of food through the block delivering
      sandwiches to fellow detainees.


143   INT. MIAMI JAIL - PHONE BANK - 1993 - DAY                   143

      OPEN CLOSE on fingers dialing a pay phone.    Cut wide to
      reveal it's Steven making a call.

                             STEVEN
                Hi baby. What do you mean? It's noon. I
                always call at noon.
                       (listens)
                Well it's prison honey, it sucks. But I'm
                getting used to it. What's wrong?


144   INT. KEMPLE'S MOTHER'S APT, 1993 - DAY - INTERCUT           144

      Kemple, on the phone at his mother's home, is INTERCUT.
      He looks ill.

                             KEMPLE
                I'm sick.

                             STEVEN
                I know.

                             KEMPLE
                No really sick. You haven't seen me in a
                year. You don't know. I just came back
                from the doctor. My T-cells are...

      He begins to cry.

                             KEMPLE (CONT'D)
                Why did you have to go to jail? How could
                you do this to me?

                             STEVEN
                I know, I'm sorry...

                             KEMPLE
                I don't want to die alone.

                             STEVEN
                You're not gonna die alone.

                             KEMPLE
                Yes I am. Who knows how long I have.

                             STEVEN
                You're not gonna die alone, okay?   Just
                believe me.

                             KEMPLE
                You don't know that.

                             STEVEN
                Yes I do. I promise.

      He hangs up, tortured by this news. His eyes catch a
      glimpse of a DETECTIVE exiting the cell block, banging on
      the GUARD BOOTH glass with his walkie-talkie.

      He just stares at the door, long and hard.


145   INT. MIAMI JAIL CORRIDOR - 1994 - DAY                     145

      Steven approaches a section of bars where a BLONDE INMATE
      is waiting.

                             STEVEN
                Did you get `em?

                             BLONDE INMATE
                Yeah.

      The inmate looks around then shoves a BALL OF CLOTHES
      through the bars. Steven gives a look. Something upsets
      him.

                             STEVEN
                What the hell's this?

                             BLONDE INMATE
                It's all I could get.

                             STEVEN

146   INT. MIAMI JAIL GUARD BOOTH - 1994 - DAY                        146

      Dressed in prison orange, Steven walks up to a counter, a
      sandwiches in hand. He holds it up before a HUGE GUARD.

                               STEVEN
                  Lunch is served.

      As the Guard goes through the bag, Steven reaches over
      the counter and swipes a WALKIE TALKIE- revealing a
      CALENDAR that reads FRIDAY the 13th. He beats a nervous
      exit.


147   INT. MIAMI JAIL HALLWAY - 1994 - DAY                            147

      OPEN CLOSE on a MAN'S ASS IN RUBY RED, SKIN TIGHT
      HOTPANTS.

      CUT TO REVEAL Steven walking nervously down the hall clad
      in said hotpants as well as a tight spaghetti strap top.
      Walkie Talkie in hand, he tries to give as authoritative
      an aura as he can.

      He gets to a glass security door, where two JAIL GUARDS
      stand. Steven taps on the glass confidently with the
      WALKIE TALKIE and signals them to open the door.

      They do.   And as he passes the two guards one of them
      speaks.

                               JAIL GUARD
                         (shaking head)
                  Undercover vice...

      Steven approaches another set of doors and signals.       The
      doors open.


148   INT. MIAMI JAIL EXIT - 1994 - DAY                               148

      Steven   passes through the doors and comes to an exit. He
      pushes   on it to find it LOCKED. Panic sets in as he
      pushes   repeatedly to no avail. And just when he thinks
      all is   lost--

      He looks down to realizes he's neglected to notice the
      PUSH BAR to open the door. And with a gentle PUSH, the
      door OPENS ...and he's gone.

149   INT. KEMPLE'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT - 1994 - BEDROOM - DAY 149

      HELEN KEMPLE brings a tray of toast and water into the
      bedroom where Steven sits over Kemple's rapidly
      deteriorating body.

                              KEMPLE
                Thanks Mom.

      She kisses both Jimmy and Steven.

                             HELEN
                I'll be in the other room.

      She exits. Steven tries to give Kemple some water. Kemple
      resists.

                             STEVEN
                Come on. You need to drink something.

      Kemple meekly hands Steven his stainless steel ROLEX.

                             KEMPLE
                I want you to have this because I'm gonna
                be leaving soon...

                             STEVEN
                Well that's not okay with me baby. You
                can't leave. I need you around here.
                You're the love of my life.

                             KEMPLE
                You're sweet... but no, I'm not.

                              STEVEN
                Shhhh...

                             KEMPLE
                I'm not. I've seen him. You haven't met
                him yet, but you will...

      Steven is perplexed.

                             KEMPLE (CONT'D)
                You're gonna be so happy. And I know you
                don't think so, but you deserve to be
                happy...

                             STEVEN
                You're not thinking clearly baby.

                             KEMPLE
                Yes I am... And you have to promise
                me... When you find him, you're gonna
                treat him right... okay?

      Steven gives in gently.

                                STEVEN
                Okay, okay.     Now drink some water.

                             KEMPLE
                Treat him right.


150   INT. KEMPLE'S MOTHER'S APARTMENT - 1994 - CONTINUOUS         150

      Helen is on the couch, watching the TV news as OJ Simpson
      is apprehended. It isn't long before a KNOCK on the door
      gets her attention. She gets up.

                                HELEN
                Who is it?

      She reaches for the door and-- SMASH!! The door bursts
      open.

      Steven is dragged kicking and SCREAMING to a squad car by
      a group of POLICEMEN.

                             STEVEN
                NO! JUST GIVE ME SOME TIME! I PROMISED!
                I PROMISED I'D BE THERE! I PROMISED HE
                WOULDN'T DIE ALONE!

      And as he futilely fights--


152   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, STEVEN'S CELL - 1994 - DAY             152

      A CLAXON BLARES and the cell door slides OPEN with
      metallic ROAR, revealing a very impatient Steven with a
      few days stubble on his face.

                             STEVEN
                It's about damn time!

      He rushes out.

153   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN - PHONE BANK - 1994 - DAY               153

      Steven hurries to the phone and dials. He nervously
      awaits an answer. Then-

                              STEVEN
                 Hi Helen it's me. Is--

      He's interrupted and proceeds to listen.       The look on his
      face says it all.

                              STEVEN (CONT'D)
                 Okay... mmm hmm...

      Through the glass wall outside the phone room, we watch
      as Steven continues to absorb the bad news.

      He hangs up the phone and falls to pieces as the
      CACOPHONY of the prison masks any sound of his grief.

                                                            BACK TO:


154   I/E   NEW HOUSE, 1996 - HOUSTON POLICE CRUISER - DAY         154

      OPEN CLOSE ON the stainless steel ROLEX. WE'RE BACK
      outside Steven and Phillip's house in a POLICE CRUISER.
      Steven stares at it, reflecting on his memory of Kemple.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I
                 just don't like talking about some
                 things.

      The door opens and a HOUSTON COP hands him a black
      LEATHERETTE CASE.

                              HOUSTON COP
                 This what you wanted?

                              STEVEN
                 Oh thanks.

                              HOUSTON COP
                 Diabetes huh?

                              STEVEN
                 Yeah...

      The cop gets in and they drive off.

155   INT. HOUSTON POLICE CRUISER - 1996 - A SHORT TIME LATER 155

      The HOUSTON COP and a DRIVING COP ride up front, not
      paying much attention to their passenger.

      In the REAR, Steven nervously and quietly prepares an
      INSULIN SYRINGE and inexpertly INJECTS IT in his belly.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                I wasn't going to lose Phillip. No way.
                I broke Jimmy's heart and I was not gonna
                break Phillip's. I was gonna make
                everything alright. No matter what it
                took, I was going to escape.

      He gives a quick look around and prepares another
      syringe. After another injection, he prepares another.

      And then ANOTHER and ANOTHER...


156   INT. HOUSTON POLICE CRUISER - 1996 - A SHORT TIME LATER 156

      The DRIVING COP watches the road blankly until his nose
      catches a putrid scent in the air.

                             DRIVING COP
                Fuck... what is that?

      The other cop smells it too. They begin to look around.

      The Driving Cop glances back to see Steven CONVULSING AND
      FROTHING AT THE MOUTH like a rabid bobble head doll.

                             DRIVING COP (CONT'D)
                Fuck!

      They turn around.

                             HOUSTON COP
                Ahh! He shit himself! Get us to the
                hospital!

      The SIREN WAILS.


157   INT. HOUSTON HOSPITAL ROOM - 1996 - DAY                    157

      Steven wakes up in a hospital bed. A little bleary at
      first, his eyes scan the room. He's alone.

      He sits up, pleased and very excited. He pulls out his
      IV, hops out of bed and heads for the window when-
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages    5-23-08   90.


      CLANG! He stops short to find his ankle is shackled to
      the bed.

                               STEVEN
                Shit!

      The door opens and the Houston Cop peers his head in. He
      looks back to his unseen partner.

                               HOUSTON COP
                He's up.


158   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL, HOUSTON - 1996 - DAY               158

      Three manacled PRISONERS, one of them Steven, follow a
      CORRECTIONS OFFICER into the Processing Area at the
      Harris County Jail.

      Each of the men are still in their street clothes and
      manacled separately.

                               CORRECTIONS OFFICER
                Take a seat.

      They take a seat on a bench outside a large steel door as
      the officer talks to a PROCESSING CLERK. Steven is
      visibly agitated and ignores the other men on the bench
      with him.

      The FIRST PRISONER turns to the SECOND PRISONER.

                             FIRST PRISONER
                What'd they get you for?

                               SECOND PRISONER
                Grand Theft.    You?

                               FIRST PRISONER
                B and E.

      The Second Prisoner turns to Steven...

                             SECOND PRISONER
                How about you?

      ...but STEVEN IS GONE.   The man looks around.

      Across the room, Steven stands in an elevator amidst a
      group of lackadaisical JANITORS, clutching a mop. The
      prisoner watches in awe as the doors CLOSE.

159   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL, HOUSTON - 1996 - LATER            159

      The elevator doors OPEN to reveal Steven, not with the
      janitors, but with a GROUP OF OFFICERS-- re-emerging from
      the elevator and back into the processing area.

      The LEAD OFFICER talks to the clerk.

                             LEAD OFFICER
                This slippery son of a bitch is going
                straight to lockup.

      Steven heaves a sigh.


160   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL PHONE BANKS, 1996 - DAY            160

      Steven, in a fresh prison jumpsuit, paces while talking
      on the phone.

                              STEVEN
                C'mon Phillip, pick up, it's me.    I'm
                sorry. C'mon.
                       (then)
                Dammit!

      He hangs up.   A nearby inmate chimes in.

                             NEW CELLMATE
                How long you in for?

                             STEVEN
                Not long.
                       (picks up phone)
                Can you hit me in the face with this?

      And off the inmate's quizzened expression--


161   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL - 1996 - INFIRMARY - DAY           161

      OPEN CLOSE on Steven's BLOODY FACE. A PRISON PHYSICIAN
      is examining it closely. We notice Steven is wearing
      WHITE SCRUBS (as opposed to the doctor who wears GREEN
      SCRUBS).

                             PHYSICIAN
                That's a pretty big gash. Just stay
                still...

                             STEVEN
                It sure hurts...
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    92.


      As Steven talks and the doctor looks, Steven stealthily
      plucks the doctor's ID BADGE and slips it in his pocket.


162   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY                  162

      Steven finishes filling the sink in his cell and pulls
      out a GREEN MAGIC MARKER. He breaks it open and drips the
      ink into the water.

      And as the water turns GREEN, Steven removes his white
      scrubs and plunges them in the sink.


163   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL GUARD STATION - 1996 - NIGHT       163

      The NIGHT GUARD watches his monitors when a rap on the
      glass gets his attention. He looks up to see Steven in
      newly (and badly) dyed GREEN SCRUBS, awaiting exit on the
      other side, holding the stolen ID BADGE against the
      glass.

                              NIGHT GUARD
                `night Doc.

      He pushes the buzzer and Steven pushes open the door.


164   EXT. TEXAS MOTEL - 1996 - DAY                              164

      Seven State and Local police cruisers sit in the parking
      lot, a shirtless Steven is removed from his motel room by
      a pair of OFFICERS. His skin is stained green but his
      expression is pure resolve.


165   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM - 1996 - DAY                        165

      OPEN CLOSE on a GAVEL striking. Steven stands before the
      judge flanked by his attorney and a bailiff.

                             HOUSTON JUDGE
                Set bail at 900,000 dollars.

                             ATTORNEY
                Your honor...

                             STEVEN
                Nine hundred thousand!? It's a white
                collar charge.

                              ATTORNEY
                Your honor-
"I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   93.


The judge begins FILLING OUT A FORM. He barely looks up
at them.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE
          Mister Russell is a flight risk. The
          bond is set. Nine hundred thousand.

                       STEVEN
          This is bullshit.
                 (sotto to attorney)
          Set a reduction hearing.

                       ATTORNEY
                 (off this)
          Your honor we'd like to set a reduction
          hearing.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE
          That's your right, but I strongly advise
          you don't.

The judge finishes filling out the form and PLACES IT AT
THE EDGE OF HIS BENCH for Steven to see.

It clearly reads his bail amount, his charge, everything.
As the Attorney PRATTLES ON in the background, Steven
just STARES AT THE FORM LONG AND HARD.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE (CONT'D)
          Fine. You can have your hearing tomorrow.

Steven interjects.

                       STEVEN
                 (sotto to Lawyer)
          Next week.

The attorney looks at him quizzically and turns back to
the judge.

                       ATTORNEY
          We'd like next week if that's okay.

                       STEVEN
                 (sotto)
          On the thirteenth.

                       ATTORNEY
          Oh the thirteenth if possible.

                       HOUSTON JUDGE
          Fine. Friday the thirteenth. Now go away.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   94.


166   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELLS - 1996 - NIGHT               166

      A block of holding cells well stocked with men waiting on
      the legal system.

      We soon come upon Steven who is furiously SKETCHING OUT A
      COPY of the form from the judge's bench from memory.


167   INT. HOUSTON APT BEDROOM (TYLER) - 1996 - DAY              167

      OPEN CLOSE on an opened envelope next to Steven's sketch
      and a letter.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                Dearest Tyler. Long time no talk. I won't
                beat around the bush. I got into a spot
                of trouble here in Houston and find
                myself needing help. That's right, jail
                again. Anyway I was wondering if you
                could type up this thing for me on your
                computer just like I sketched out...

      As Steven `reads' the letter we reveal a MAN hacking away
      on a computer nearby. As we move closer, we see that
      he's the MOUSTACHED MAN from the night of his car crash
      and he's not wearing pants.


168   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL CELL - 1996 - DAY                  168

      Steven opens a letter and pulls out the FORGED FORM.

                             STEVEN
                Great!

      He grabs a pen and begins filling it out.


169   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - 1996 - DAY              169

      Manacled to a line of prisoners, Steven shuffles through
      a crowded hallway. Courthouse staff are everywhere.

      Steven spots a HARRIED woman approaching with an armful
      of paperwork.

      He reaches into his jumpsuit and pulls out the FORGED
      DOCUMENT and as she passes- HE DROPS IT.

                             STEVEN
                Ma'am?!

      The woman turns back, annoyed.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08    95.


                             STEVEN (CONT'D)
                Dropped something.

      She picks it up and puts it on her pile. He smiles as he
      watches her walk away.


170   INT. HARRIS COUNTY JAIL PHONE BANK, 1996- DAY               170

      Steven dials the phone.


171   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE - CLERKS OFFICE, 1996 - DAY         171

      INTERCUT, a CLERK answers her RINGING PHONE.    Her desk
      CALENDAR reads: "September, Friday the 13th"

                             CLERK
                This is Julie.

      Steven puts on his best SOUTHERN BELLE VOICE.

                             STEVEN
                       (as woman)
                Hi, I have Judge Charles Hearn for the
                clerk's office.

                                CLERK
                Alright.

                             STEVEN
                I'll put him through.

      Steven switches to an authoritative JUDGE VOICE.

                             STEVEN (CONT'D)
                       (gruff)
                This the clerk's office?

                                CLERK
                It is.

                             STEVEN
                Charles Hearn- I got a bail adjustment
                coming through, sent it over today.

                             CLERK
                Sure thing. What's the name?

                             STEVEN
                Russell. Steven Jay.

                             CLERK
                Got it right here.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages   5-23-08   96.


                             STEVEN
                Good, I need that to go through right
                away. Because if it don't, I'm gonna have
                to chug about a quart of Tidee Bowl on
                account of all the shit I'll be eating.
                Know what I mean?

      Julie GIGGLES.

                             CLERK
                You got it Judge.

                             STEVEN
                And say- Julie? Can you save me a dime
                and connect me to a good bail bondsman?

                              JULIE
                Sure thing.


172   EXT. GALVESTON HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                          172

      A LIMOUSINE pulls up outside a modest Galveston house.
      The CHAUFFEUR opens the door and Steven emerges dressed
      in new linen suit and clutching champagne and flowers.

      He approaches the door and just as he's about to knock--

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                Go away Steven!

      Steven is surprised.

                             PHILLIP (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                You think I didn't know you were coming!?

                              STEVEN
                Phillip-

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                Get the hell out of here! I'm done with
                you!

                             STEVEN
                Don't say that.

                             PHILLIP (O.S.)
                They probably have a psychic after you
                right now! Did you see any bunnies!?

                             STEVEN
                Honey, I know you're upset- but we love
                each other.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   97.


                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          You opened a bank account for Doctor
          Phillip Morris! Now they think I'm in on
          everything! I'm facing real time! You
          know I can't go back to prison.

                       STEVEN
          I'm sorry about that- they weren't
          supposed to find that. It was for your
          own good. So we could be together.

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          Fuck off! I'm in enough trouble.

                       STEVEN
          C'mon Phillip, just trust me-

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          FUCK YOU YOU FUCKING LIAR! Do you realize
          how bad you've fucked me over!! You made
          me an accomplice! You fucking liar! I
          don't want to see you. Go away! I never
          want to see you again!

                       STEVEN
          Phillip don't say that.

No response.

                       STEVEN (CONT'D)
          Well what am I supposed to do?

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          You're the lawyer, you figure it out.

This time, it's Steven who remains silent.

                         PHILLIP (O.S.) (CONT'D)
          Oh my God...

THE DOOR SWINGS OPEN, revealing a SEETHING PHILLIP.

                       PHILLIP (CONT'D)
          You're not even a lawyer?! You fucking
          liar!

                         STEVEN
          Well...

He slams the door shut again.

                       PHILLIP (O.S.)
          What the hell's going on?! Who the hell
          are you!?
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"         Green Pages   5-23-08     98.


                             STEVEN
                Open the door Phillip.

                                 PHILLIP (O.S.)
                No.

      Steven walks up to the door and pleads gently.

                              STEVEN
                       (quietly)
                Open the door. Just open the door.
                       (beat)
                Open the door. Please. I just want to
                say one thing. Please. Just one thing.
                That's all. Please.

      A long silence. Steven waits longer than he should with
      the certainty that it will open. And eventually it
      does... slowly and tentatively.

      Through the screen door, their eyes are just inches
      apart. Steven looks into Phillip's soul. He opens his
      mouth and--

                             SWAT COMMANDER (O.S.)
                Down on the ground faggots!!

      Steven and Phillip are shocked to see a small SWAT team
      surrounding the front porch with automatic weapons.

                                 SWAT COMMANDER (CONT'D)
                DOWN!    DOWN!    NOW!

      And as they comply and the armed men descend--


173   INT. GALVESTON POLICE STATION - 1996 - DAY                     173

      Steven and Phillip sit manacled, side by side. They stare
      at the floor in miserable uncomfortable silence.

                                 STEVEN
                Phillip?

                                 PHILLIP
                Don't.

                                 STEVEN
                I love you.

      No response. Phillip can only sit and stew.       And stew.
      Until finally, he's had enough.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   99.


                             PHILLIP
                From the moment we met, you've done
                nothing but lie. Our whole
                relationship... just lies. I'm such an
                asshole. You took advantage of me- just
                like all the rest of them. You were
                supposed to protect me- but you've done
                nothing but make a fool of me. And you
                expect me to love you? How can I love
                you? I don't even know who you are. And
                you know what's sad? I don't even think
                you know who you are. So how am I
                supposed to love something that don't
                even exist? You tell me.

      Eventually a POLICEMAN stands before Phillip.

                                POLICEMAN (O.S.)
                Morris.     You're up.

      Before he stands up, Phillip manages a terse statement.

                             PHILLIP
                I will never forgive you Steven. Never.

      Steven is speechless as he watches Phillip walk away-
      disappearing down a long corridor.

                                           SLOW DISSOLVE TO WHITE:

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                That was the last time I ever saw him.


174   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1997 - CELL BLOCK - DAY                 174

      PHILLIP carries his belongings past a line of hulking,
      cat-calling convicts.

                             STEVEN (V.O.)
                ...But I knew he was right. Phillip,
                Jimmy, Debbie- they've all been right.
                My whole life was nothing but a bunch of
                lies. Lies to make people love me, lies
                to keep them from leaving me and lies to
                make them give me their money.

      He enters his cell.


175   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT BLOCK- DAY          175

      Steven carries his belongings to his new cell in Michael
      Unit.
       "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08   100.


                               STEVEN (V.O.)
                  And in the process I lost track of who I
                  was. Maybe Barbra Bascombe had me pegged
                  right from the beginning and that's why
                  she gave me up...


175A    INT. TX STATE PEN - MICHAEL UNIT CELL, 1997 - DAY        175A

        Steven stares at his distorted face in the polished metal

                               STEVEN (V.O.)
                  Whatever the case, how does a person who
                  doesn't exist go on existing? Well the
                  answer is- he doesn't.

        Steven is curled up in a ball in his cell, SOBBING as he
        stares at a SNAPSHOT of Phillip in Key West pasted to the
        wall.

                               BUNKMATE (O.S.)
                  Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to sleep.

        Steven sits over an untouched tray of food, staring at it
        detached. He looks thin. Pale.


179     INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1997 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - NIGHT      179

        Steven kneels over the toilet in his cell.   The sound of
        PUKING reverberates.


180     INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - MICHAEL UNIT CELL - MORNING 180

        Months later, Steven sits up in his bed. He now has a
        grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he has lost
        an unhealthy amount of weight.

       OPEN CLOSE on the gaunt and grey-skinned Steven. A MALE
       NURSE places a thermometer in his mouth and looks at
       Steven's medical history. He looks concerned.

                              MALE NURSE
                 I'll be right back.


182    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY OFFICE - DAY       182

       Steven sits before a YOUNG PRISON DOCTOR who looks
       through his records.

                              YOUNG DOCTOR
                 I'm sorry to have to tell you this
                 Steven, your t-cell counts indicate that,
                 uh... Well... you have AIDS.

       Steven sits expressionless.

                              STEVEN
                 How long do I have?

       And off the Doctor's grave face--

       CLOUDS drift slowly across the sky.

       The OPENING SCENE again- the four kids lying on the hill,
       staring at the clouds. Young Steven smiles at the sight.

       A dull WHINE is heard, building until--

       The first hospital scene in the movie. The cardio ALARM
       blares. Steven watches from his bed as a DOCTOR appears
       and pushes the nurses aside.

                              DOCTOR
                 Where's the crash cart!?

       He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
       the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)

       A sheet is pulled over the cardio victim's corpse and
       Steven watches as it is wheeled out of the ward.

       He returns his bleary gaze to the ceiling.

                               STEVEN (V.O.)
                 I've been in this bed for months now.
                 Waiting to die. The only thing that keeps
                 me going is the thought that I might get
                 a chance to see Phillip one more time.
                        (beat)
                 But I don't know how much longer I can do
                 this...

       Steven's eyes roll back into his head as he slips into
       unconsciousness.


186    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - CELL - DAY                   186

       A slightly built, effeminate inmate (SAMUEL) raps on
       Phillip's open cell door as he enters.

                              SAMUEL
                 Got a minute?

                               PHILLIP
                 Samuel.   You want some crackers?

                              SAMUEL
                 No... thanks. Look- I just talked to my
                 friend- he's a nurse at the infirmary. I
                 don't know if you know this or not but
                 uh...

       Phillip looks to him with curiosity.

                 I need to see him!

                              DOCTOR
                 I told you he's not here! You need to
                 calm down.

       Phillip calms himself.

                              PHILLIP
                 Just tell me where he is. What happened?

                              DOCTOR
                 He slipped into a coma for a few days.
                 He's conscious now, but he's very sick.
                 We had him transferred to a private care
                 facility. There was nothing we could do
                 for him here. It's just a matter of time
                 now.

       Phillip listens in devastated silence.


188    EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER - 1998 - DAY                 188

       Steven looks worse than ever in his semi-private bed,
       looking out the window at the clouds with a catatonic
       gaze.

       He's at peace. It is the moment of his death.

                                CARETAKER (O.S.)
                 Steven?

       Death will have to wait another few moments.    A nurse
       leans over him as he tries to focus.

                              CARETAKER (CONT'D)
                 Steven? Someone wants to talk to you.
                 He keeps calling. He's driving us crazy.

       Steven can't respond.    The nurse picks up the phone.

                              CARETAKER (CONT'D)
                        (into phone)
                 Okay you can put him through.

       She puts the phone to Steven's ear. He can muster only a
       few words.

                               PHILLIP
                 Steven. Oh God... Why didn't you write
                 me? I don't know how this happened, they
                 say I'm fine. Oh God, who did this?
                        (then)
                 It doesn't matter. I had to talk to you
                 Steven.
                        (tearing up)
                 I am still angry with you, but I need you
                 to know something. Even if sometimes I
                 don't know who you are, I love you. I
                 never stopped loving you.
                        (smiles)
                 You and me are just fools for love I
                 guess- written in the stars or some crap
                 like that.
                        (tears)
                 But it was never better, never more real
                 than with you Steven. I realize now that
                 all that crazy shit you did- in your
                 fucked up way- it was always for me.
                 Always for us. You are the most amazing
                 man Steven. It takes my breath away. And
                 even though I can't be with you now, I
                 will always be yours... Forever.

       He steels himself as best he can.

                              PHILLIP (CONT'D)
                 Now if you have to go, go. It's okay.
                 I'm right there. Okay? I'm right there.

       Tears surface again.   He chokes back a sob.

       As a single tear runs down Steven's face, the nurse puts

       Steven lies motionless.   He gazes out the window to the
       passing clouds in the sky. It's time.

       Samuel walks past cell after cell with a grave look in
       his eyes. Eventually he arrives at Phillip's cell to
       find him sitting on his bunk.

                               SAMUEL
                 Phillip...?

       Phillip looks up.

                               SAMUEL (CONT'D)
                 Uh- my friend in the infirmary... Uh,
                 they got a call from that long term care
                 place and uh, well a few days ago Steven-
                        (then)
                 ...I'm so sorry Phillip.

       Phillip nods as it washes over him. He sends Samuel on
       his way with a look. Once he's alone, Phillip lets go
       and SOBS.

       He buries his face in his pillow. After a long while-

       CLANG. A sound gets his attention.    A BOSSY GUARD stands
       at the door of his cell.

                               BOSSY GUARD
                 Morris.   Come with me.

                 Your lawyer's here.

       He swings open the door to reveal STEVEN, alive and well
       and wearing a thrift store suit.

       Phillip is aghast, frozen.

                 Shut the fuck up, I'm trying to sleep.

                 Fuck you. I got a broken heart here.

       We see now his Bunkmate is Cleavon.

                 Well then do something about it mother
                 fucker- `stead of crying like Whitney
                 Houston looking for her crack pipe.

       Steven takes his kind words to heart.

                 moment of clarity. It became clear to me-
                 I had to get to Phillip. No matter what.
                 Even if it meant dying...

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 Faking your death from AIDS is no easy
                 task, believe me. But after watching
                 Jimmy die, I thought I could make it
                 convincing. First, you have to starve
                 yourself- I ate half as much every day
                 for ten months. After that, you have to
                 fake all sorts of symptoms.

                 You gotta keep this up for months until
                 you lose about, say, 80 pounds.

       now has a grey beard and with his shirt off we can see he
       has lost an unhealthy amount of weight.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)

       Steven enters an inmate's cell (LAWRENCE) with a BIG BAG

       Lawrence sweeps up in an empty office. He looks to see
       if the coast is clear and bolts for some file cabinets.

       After some searching, Lawrence pulls out a file entitled
       "Russell, Steven A". Reading from a scrap of paper, he
       scrawls something with a pen.

       Lawrence then reaches into his pants and pulls out some
       forged forms- stuffing them into the folder.

       Steven. A MALE NURSE places a thermometer in his mouth
       and looks at Phillip's medical history.

       CLOSE ON THE FILE- a doctor's entry reads "HIV+ since 91"
       A few flips of the pages reveal FORGED BLOOD TEST
       DOCUMENTS. Buzzwords like T-CELL COUNTS and other terms
       catch the Nurse's eye.

       He looks concerned.

                 I'll be right back.


200    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY EXAM ROOM - DAY     200

       FLASHBACK. Steven sits before a YOUNG PRISON DOCTOR who
       looks through his records.

                              YOUNG DOCTOR
                 ...you have AIDS.

       Steven sits expressionless.

                              STEVEN
                 How long do I have?

       And off the Doctor's grave face--
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    109.


201    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 201

       Steven lays in his hospital bed. A FAT NURSE puts a pill
       in his mouth and follows it with some water. She exits.

       Once she's clear, Steven reaches into his mouth and pulls
       out the pill. He secretly places it into a small HOLE in
       his mattress for safe keeping.


202    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 202

       FLASHBACK. Again, we are at the first hospital scene of
       the movie. The cardio ALARM blares. Steven watches as a
       DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside.

                              DOCTOR
                 Where's the crash cart!?

       He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard-
       the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard.

       With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his
       mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills. He stuffs
       them into his mouth as fast as he can.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 But the hardest part by far is getting
                 transferred to a private care facility.
                 It's standard procedure for late stage
                 patients, but convincing them I was about
                 to die would involve taking a few risks.

       He chases the pills down with a glass of water.


203    EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                 203

       Steven is helped from a corrections van into a wheelchair
       outside the Restful Acres facility.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 After a four day coma, they were convinced.


204    INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                 204

       In his bed at the care facility, Steven looks around and
       picks up the phone. He talks with a FOREIGN ACCENT.

                              STEVEN
                 This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin
                 Center, Houston. I'm looking for AIDS
                 patients for a study we're...
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   110.


       And as he talks--

                               STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                 And once I got settled in, I just called
                 the Department of Corrections and
                 convinced them I was a state-sponsored
                 doctor looking for late stage AIDS
                 patients for an experimental treatment.
                        (then)
                 As luck would have it, they had one
                 patient that was eligible...

       Steven continues his Dr. Rios imitation on the phone.

                              STEVEN
                 Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you
                 spell that?

       CAMERA SETTLES on a nearby CALENDAR.    It reads: "MONDAY,
       JANUARY 5"

                                                MATCH DISSOLVE TO:


205    INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                   205

       The calendar reads "FRIDAY, MARCH 13"    An ORDERLY enters
       with a WHEELCHAIR.

                              ORDERLY
                 Mister Russell, the clinic sent a taxi
                 here to pick you up.


206    I/E. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                   206

       Later that day, Steven is helped out of his wheelchair
       into a waiting taxi.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 And for all that time- all those doctors,
                 all those nurses and all those
                 facilities... not one of them ever
                 thought to give me an AIDS test...

       The door SLAMS and off he drives.

                              STEVEN (V.O.)
                 Fucking Texas...


207    INT. TAXI, 1998 - DAY                                        207

       Once clear, Steven speaks to the driver.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages      5-23-08   111.


                               STEVEN
                  I had a special request when I ordered
                  the cab. Did they tell you?

                               TAXI DRIVER
                  Yeah- right here.

       He lifts a GREASY BROWN BAG into view.

                                STEVEN
                  Thank God.

       Steven grabs it and begins to gorge himself on BURGERS.

                               STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                  A week later, the hospice was to get a
                  call from Doctor Rios, telling them
                  Steven Russell had died undergoing
                  treatment. And after all that hard work
                  dying? Where's the first place I go?


208    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN MEETING ROOM, 1998 - DAY              208

       BACK TO MEETING ROOM. Phillip stands frozen before Steven

                                STEVEN (V.O.)
                  Funny, huh?

       The guard pushes Phillip past the threshold.    The door
       SLAMS SHUT behind him.

       He staggers toward Steven as a kaleidoscope of emotions
       plays across his face. Bewilderment, relief, sorrow, joy
       and finally, anger-

       WHACK!   He slaps Steven across the face.

                               PHILLIP
                  You're such a fucker!

                               STEVEN
                  I know- I'm sorry- You weren't supposed
                  to find out.

                                PHILLIP
                  Well I did!

                                STEVEN
                  I couldn't take a chance telling you. You
                  know that. I couldn't. But Phillip, I
                  only did it so I could get here to you.
                         (then)
                  Just to talk to you. And here I am.
"I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages        5-23-08   112.


 Phillip tries to take this to heart. After a moment...

                        PHILLIP
           You're so skinny.

                        STEVEN
           I'm fine. Just hungry.

                        PHILLIP
           Steven I don't-

                        STEVEN
           Wait. Listen. I just came here to tell
           you one thing and that's it. You don't
           have to take me back, I just want to say
           one thing.

 Phillip is listening.

                         STEVEN (CONT'D)
           I know you thought we were nothing but a
           lie- but underneath all those lies there
           was always something that was real. I
           thought about what you said to me. You
           said you don't know who I am. But I have
           to tell you- I know now. I know who I
           am. I mean- I'm not a lawyer, I'm not a
           CFO, I'm not a cop. Hell I'm not even an
           escape artist. Those Steven Russells are
           dead. And now, all that's left is the man
           that loves you. That's all. Nothing
           else. I'm just the man that loves you.
                  (then)
           And if you can see that... believe it...
           then I promise I'll never be anything
           else ever again.

 A LONG, LONG SILENCE.   Phillip looks to him.

                        PHILLIP
           How do I know you're not bullshitting me
           again?

 Steven pauses.   He looks Phillip square in the eye.

                         STEVEN
           You don't.

 And as Phillip stares at him-

                                                 CUT TO BLACK:
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   113.


       A long SILENCE.   Then finally...

                                                         FADE IN:


209    INT. TEXAS COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR - 1998 - DAY                209

       At a window, a CLERK stamps a few documents and hands
       them to Steven, who is dressed in his lawyer attire.

       Steven exits the line and ducks into a nearby bathroom.


210    INT. TEXAS COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM - 1998 - DAY              210

       At the urinal, Steven whistles to himself.

       SUPER: "Steven Russell was arrested two weeks later
       trying to secure Phillip's release."

       Steven turns his head to find the man at the next urinal
       staring at him. It's a very surprised Birkheim with a
       badge affixed to his jacket reading, "JUROR".

       Steven SMILES at him.


211    INT. TEXAS COURTROOM - 1999 - DAY                          211

       Steven sits in court while a FEMALE D.A. argues her case.

       SUPER: "An embarrassment to the State of Texas and
       Governor George Bush, Steven was given an unprecedented
       life sentence."

       She nods to the audience where Lindholm sits smiling.

       SUPER: "Coincidentally, the D.A. who prosecuted him was
       the Sister in law of Dan Lindholm- Steven's former boss"


212    INT. LOCKDOWN CELL, 1999 - NIGHT                           212

       Steven smiles wide, shackled in a solitary 6 by 7 cell.

       SUPER: "Steven sits in 23 hour-a-day lockdown, with only
       one hour a day for supervised showers and exercise."

       Steven stares at his Key West CALENDAR with a small photo
       of Phillip attached to it.

       The cell brightens, everything around Steven blooms with
       white light. He looks to see.
      "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08     114.


213    EXT. OCEAN - DAY                                           213

       STEVEN'S POV. Phillip also enveloped in white light,
       sits on the bow of staring at him with a smile.

       Steven smiles back.

                                                   FADE TO BLACK.

       SUPER:   "On average, there are 1.7 Friday the 13ths a
       year.



214    EXT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY - DAY                        214

       A SIREN BLARES over a wide of the facility. Small in
       frame, we see Steven running from the prison gaining
       ground on the two guards chasing him.


                                 THE END
