1·    EXT. RUSSIA -- NIGHT




      We open on a GUARD sitting in front of a sentry post. He is
      wearing a heavy fur hat that covers his ears and a military-
      jacket. Behind him is a list of instructions (in Russian).
      He 'sucks in a cigarette as though he's a drowning man lookin
      for oxygen. A CAR comes to a stop by the sentry post, the,
      guard looks, asks a couple of questions and is given an
     -envelope which he quickly examines, he then attempts to stick
      his head in the car. A gun barrel is promptly stuck in his
      face and a couple of angry words emanate from the back, the
      guard jumps back and quickly raises the barrier.



     This next section will be intercut with the credit sequence.

2    INT. BACK OF RUSSIAN CAR -- NIGHT

     On the back seat is FRANKY FOUR -FINGERS, (New York street
     wise Jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which
     is handcuffed to his wrist. He is flanked by TWO RUSSIAN
     HOODS. This next section will be subtitled.

                           FRANKY FOUR FINGERS

               How much further do we have to go?
     Just then the car comes to a standstill. The window is wound
     down and a gun barrel is stuck through. The RUSSIAN DRIVER
     looks dramatically calm.

                           RUSSIAN

               Pass him the money.
     Franky hesitates for a second.

                           RUSSIAN (CONT'D)

               Franky you know you have no choice.
               So please can we get on with it?
      Franky knows discussion is futile. He flips the case open
      and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of American
      dollars. The package is pulled out of the window, the driver
      doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety
      is more than obvious, but Four Fingers can do nothing. All
      of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car
      speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery.

    Franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of
    a fist. He shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin
    monocle to his eye. He's satisfied.

    Franky Four Fingers opens a fancy case, presses a hidden
    catch, this reveals a second wall within the case, he then
    carefully places the stone within this secret compartment
    and firmly closes the case. The Russian next to him is
    playing with a revolver, he spins the chamber.

    We are in the back room of an amusement arcade and can hear
    fruit machines beeping in the distance. Meet BORIS THE BLADE
    and TOMMY who is toying with a heavy-looking revolver.

                             TOMMY

                 It's a bit heavy isn't it Boris?

                             BORIS

                 Heavy is good. Heavy is reliable.
                 If it doesn't work you can hit him
                 with it.
    Tommy practices a couple of gun slinging maneuvers. He's
    impressed. At that moment the door opens and in walks a MAN
    carrying two heavy sacks of coins. He's a rough looking
    bastard, he's massive, and extremely ugly. Meet GORGEOUS

    GEORGE.

                            TOMMY

                Yes Gorgeous?
      George looks at the weapon and can see that he's interrupting.

                            GORGEOUS GEORGE

                Sorry Tommy, I hope that I am not
                interrupting.

                            TOMMY

                Oh of course you're not interrupting
                Gorgeous, I put the do not disturb
                sign on the door because I wanted
                you to join us.
      George isn't too bright

                            GORGEOUS GEORGE

                What are you doing Tommy?

                              TOMMY

                I am baking a cake Gorgeous, not
                that i t ' s any of your business. Put
                the takings down, and be a good chap.
    -. George puts down the coins. Tommy implies he should leave.
       Gorgeous isn't too bright and continues to stand there looking
       stupid. Tommy goes to turn around but can see that he hasn't
       left, so he turns back,

                            TOMMY (CONT'D)

                Is there anything else Gorgeous, a
                cup of tea perhaps? No? Well in
                that could you kindly fuck off and
                shut the door behind you?



      Tommy turns round to Boris with a slight shake of his head.

                            TOMMY (CONT'D)

                Not too bright but he hits like a
                train. OK I ' l l take it. You're a
                gambling man Boris, so I'll toss you
                for it. Heads it's mine, tails I'll
                give you twice the price.
      Boris chews this for a second.

                                  BORIS

                   I ' l l toss the coin.
      He tosses the coin

              We do too much business together.
              You're gonna have to get someone
              else to hit him and there is no way

7   EX.T. BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING -- DAY

    BRICK TOP (aka MR MCLEAN) is a heavy looking fella. He is
    observing a giant of a man, BOMBER HARRIS, boxing a sparring
    partner.

                          BRICK TOP

              Two hundred and sixty pounds, that's
              fucking pedigree pal.
    He's talking to LIAM and GARY, a couple of employees.

                          BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

              He doesn't look bad does he?

                          GARY

              Oh no Mr Mclean, he looks great.

                             LIAM

              Yeah great.

                          GARY

              He'll kill him, he'll do you proud
              governor.

                          BRICK TOP

              Do you reckon that's what people
              should do for me, do you Gary, do me
              proud?

                          GARY

              That's what you deserve Mr Mclean.

             Pull your tongue out of my arsehoie
             Gary. Dogs do that, and you're not
             a dog, are you Gary?
    Taken aback by the change in tone.




                         GARY

             Err no, I am not.

                         BRICK TOP

             However, you do have all of the
             characteristics of a dog Gary, all
             except loyalty.
    There is a definite change in temperature.

                           BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             And people like dogs Gary, for the
             principal reason that they're loyal.
             So I don't quite know where that
             leaves you my old son, other than
             refuckinpugnant. . .
    There is a problem

                         BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             Which one was it that kept the four
             grand from the Clapham job?
    Pause

                         BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

             Don't let me ask again. I would
             like answers, but I am not in the
             mood for asking questions, get busy
             lads, or it's feeding time, oink,
             oink, know what I mean?
    Liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways
    action implying the guilt lies with Gary. Gary catches this
    and opens his mouth to protest. One of Brick Tops's henchmen,
    ERROL, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes
    a bar across Gary's legs, he buckles. The henchman man pulls
    out a plastic bag and a roll of tape.

                            BRICK TOP (CONT'D')

                 You know what to do with that don't
                 you Liam?

    CUT TO FIGHTERS. SMALLER FIGHTER IS DISTRACTED.

    POV of Smaller Fighter, we witness Liam putting the bag over
    Gary's head and tying tape round his neck. Gary tries to
    resist but it's futile and we vaguely witness the demise of
    poor Gary.

    Brick Top turns away at this point to admire his fighter.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 But I got no time for grasses.



    We cut to see Liam's panic filled eyes. The bar comes down
    again. Brick Top finds more interest in his fighter.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 Feed em to the pigs Errol.
    With a short beat.

                             BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                 He's looking good, Bomber, is he
                 not? How's their man getting on?
    We whip pan off Brick Top's boxing ring...

8   EXT. ANOTHER BACK ALLEY MAKESHIFT BOXING RING - - DAY

    ...And the whip pan shot takes us into this boxing ring.
    Meet TURKISH, he is Tommy's partner. Turkish is older and
    wiser than Tommy, they are both watching Gorgeous go through
    his paces. Gorgeous George is head butting a heavy punch
    bag. The sound that emanates is disturbing, and Tommy is
    distracted.

                             TOMMY

                 Is he allowed to do that?
    Turkish is drinking milk from a bottle

                             TURKISH

                 It's an unlicensed boxing match Tommy,
                 not a tickling competition. These

              Oi son, look lively.



    He turns .back to Tommy.

                              TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Look at it.



    He turns to see the remnants of a caravan where they keep
    the training gear and administration for the fights

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              How am I supposed to run this thing
              from that? We gonna need a proper
              office.
    He looks at the caravan again and sighs, it is quite pitiful

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              I want a new one Tommy and you 're
              going to buy it for me.

                          TOMMY

              What's wrong with this one?
    Turning back to Tommy and ascending the steps in to his "I
    have seen better days" caravan, TURKISH'S foot goes through
    one of the stairs and the.door comes off at the hinges as he
    tries to open it.

                          TURKISH

              Oh nothing Tommy, it's tip top, it's
              just I am not sure about the colour.
    He passes him a piece of paper

                          TURKISH (CONT'D)

              Here it's all arranged. You just
              gotta pick it up. Here's an address.
    Tommy looks at the address and frowns.

                                TOMMY

                 I t ' s that campsite.

                             TURKISH

                 That's right, you're buying a caravan,
                 caravans live in campsites.

Pointing quite clearly at the gun.

             No Tommy, there's a gun in your
             trousers. What is a gun doing in
             your trousers?

                          TOMMY

             It's for protection.

                         TURKISH

             Protection from what, the Germans?
             The war ended fifty years ago. Err
             what's to stop it blowing your balls
             off every time you sit down? Where
             did you get it?
Looking down onto his gun.

             Russian.

     DOUG THE HEAD is an east London Jew, about forty five, almost
     completely bald and proud of it, he sits with his two twin
     daughters ALEX and SUSI - they look like Prada models but as
     soon as they open their mouths, it's clear that they aren't,
     they have extremely rough London accents. Doug is on the
     phone to Hands.

                  Well what are you waiting for?




                              KID 1

                  The five quid you are going to pay
                  me.
     Chuckling.

                              TOMMY

                  Oh fuck off, I'll find him myself.

                                KID 1

                  Two fifty.

                              TOMMY

                  You can have a quid.

                              KID 1

                  Oh you're a tight fucker aren't ya?
     A man shouts from the background. He's a young fella with a
     hard but friendly face (when he smiles). He's covered in
     grease and facial hair, and his trousers are done up with
     string. But he's wearing a Cartier watch and Gucci shoes,
     and a large gold identity bracelet. This is MICKY O'NEILL.

                              MIC KY

                  What are you doing Paul? Get out of
                  the way boy. Are you Tommy, have
                  you come about the caravan?

                                TOMMY

                  Mr O'Neill?

                              MICKY

                  Fuck man, call me Micky.
     Micky comes up to the car, cleaning his grease covered hands
     with a hand towel.

                                TOMMY

                  How are ya?

                 I am well sir, well, quite well, the
                 weather is being kind to us but the
                 engines aren't.



     Gorgeous George steps out of the car.      Micky takes a step
     back.

                             MICKY (CONT'D)

                 Fuck me, would you look at the size
                 of him, Jesus man how big are you?
                 Hey kids how fucking big is he?

                             KID 2

                 He's a big man that's for sure.

                             MICKY

                 Would you look at the size of his
                 muscles? And then look at the size
                 of his fists. Hey Mum, come and
                 look at the size of this fella.
     The kids start to feel his arms. Gorgeous George plays the
     game and raises the kids on his biceps. Micky's MUM comes
     out to see.

                             MICKY (CONT'D)

                 Would you look at the strength of
                 the man? I bet you can box a little
                 can't you sir? You look like a boxer.

                             MUM

                 Get out of the way Micky and see if
                 the fellas would like a drink.

                             TOMMY

                 I could murder one.

                             MUM

                 There won't be any murdering done
                 around here, I don't mind telling
                 ya.

                             MICKY

                 Would the big fella like a cup of
                 tea?

                             MUM

                 Don't be silly Micky, a man didn't
                 get that size from drinking cups of
                 tea. Offer the man a Guiness boy.

                             KID 2

     Tommy and Gorgeous follow Micky who's walking past a kennel.
     The dogs are in good condition, and are happy as you like to
     see. Micky stops and gives one of them a stroke.

                             MICKY

                 Good dogs, do you like dogs?

                             TOMMY

                 Sure, yeah, I like dogs.   I like
                 caravans more.

15   INT. TYRONE'S CAR

     We open on Vinny's dog, now sitting in a car, it's breathing
     heavily and doesn't look well, and Sol doesn't see the funny
     side of the dog sitting next to him. The man driving is
     called TYRONE: he's a white guy who thinks he's black. Vin
     is also in the car.

                             TYRONE

                 I don't want him dribbling on my             ,
                 seats man.

                             SOL

                 Give him another of those biscuits.
                 They shut him up.

                             VINNY

                 They give him wind.
     Tyrone turns round to complain, and narrowly misses a car.

                             VINNY (CONT'D)

                 Hey watch the road! Fuck me, you
                 want this man to drive us Sol? Can
                 you drive mate?

                             SOL

                 No Vin, he can't tell the difference
                 between a steering wheel and a man
               . on the moon. That' s why I got him.
     Sol gives the dog another biscuit.

                             TYRONE

                 Don't you worry about me, jus worry
                 about the dog on my seats man!
     Tyrone gets out of the car to put some petrol in.

                           SOL

               I don't know Vin. Oi Tyrone, Vin
               wants to know why you talk like a
               black man?

                           TYRONE

               Roots and ting, seen?



     Sol and Vin raise their eyebrows.

                           VINNY

               Roots and what?

                           SOL

               I don't know. You get that gun from
               Boris?

                           VINNY

               Got it. It wasn't exactly what I
               was expecting, mind. Mean looking
               bastard though, that's for sure.
     Sol unzips a bag.     Inside is a ridiculously powerful shotgun.

                           SOL

               What's that?

                              VINNY

                  It's a shotgun Sol.

                             SOL

               I t ' s a fuckin anti-aircraft gun Vin.
               What are you planning on shooting,
               the angels out of the clouds? That's
               gonna raise more than pulses.

                              VINNY

                  It will raise hell my old son.

                          SOL

              I don't think I really want to see
            · hell Vin. What's wrong with a normal
              gun?

                              VINNY

                  The are psychological advantages to
                  a gun that looks like it can perforate
                  the moon.

     Tyrone gets into the car, starts it up again and puts some
     money in the car wash machine.

                             SOL

                 Can you get this fuckin dog to stop
                 dribbling on me?
     Vin pulls the dog back.

                              SOL (CONT'D)

                 I worry about you Vin, Jesus, talk
                 about overkill. One look at a crack
                 desperate brother and you could wave
                 a knife and fork around, and I am
                 sure they would lick the salt of
                 your scrotum.
     The car wash starts.

                             VINNY

                 What the fuck are you doing?

                             TYRONE

                 I never do a job unless I have a
                 clean car, I like to make my wheels
                 look crisp.

                             VINNY

                 Are you serious,? You' re a getaway
                 driver, you're not here to show your
                 fuckin car off.               ··.
     The machine starts. They do the windows up and that point
     the dog lets out a fart. The water starts to hit the
     windshield so they can't undo the windows. There is more an
     atmosphere of disbelief than of concrete anger.

16   EXT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE




     Gorgeous George fastens the caravan to the back of their
     Land Rover and pulls away. They wave at Micky and he
     reciprocates.

                             MICKY

                 He's a good dog. He'll get a little
                 homesick for a while but he'11 get
                 over it.
     Tommy has a dog that looks distressed about leaving Micky
     sitting next to him.

               I don't know what all your fuss was
               about. They aren't bad fellas.
     Just then the wheels of the caravan come straight off and
     the caravan is dragged until the car comes to a sudden stop.
     The dog jumps out the window and goes bounding back to the
     campsite.

18   EXT. CARAVAN -- DAY




     They are looking at the damage.   Of course i t ' s completely
     useless now.

               I don't think it's supposed to have
               done that.

     The dog is behind Micky's legs happy to be back.

                           MICKY

               The deal was you bought it how you
               saw it.
      Tommy goes to interrupt but he doesn't get a chance

                           MICKY (CONT'D)

               Look, I have helped ya as much as I

               car and I suggest you use it before
               you're not welcome anymore.
     There is a silence for a while. The atmosphere has gone
     more than frosty and a few more gypsies are hanging around.

                           GORGEOUS GEORGE

               It was only a question of time before
               you got some attention. Nobody brings
               a fella the size of you unless they
               are trying to say something without
               talking.

                           TOMMY

     Micky's Mum is getting upset and it's consequently upsetting
     Micky.

                  Okay mum okay. You need to sit down.

     We see Mum being led out by Darren; Micky looks genuinely
     concerned for his mum. Pause as Micky waits for her to be
     well gone.

     Tommy looks at Gorgeous George.        Gorgeous George raises his
     eyebrows.

20   INT. HORSE BOX, PIKEY CAMP -- DAY

     The two fighters start pacing. It looks a bit ridiculous,
     Micky is dwarfed by comparison. Gorgeous George takes a
     swipe: it was an .impressive punch, but Micky is a quick littl
     bastard and sidesteps. Micky does nothing to retaliate; his
     hands are still by his,side.







                                                   (CONTINUED)





20   CONTINUED:




     Gorgeous George lunges out and grabs Micky by the throat and
     groin, picks him up like a sack of spuds and throws him
     against the car door. All eyes are on Micky for a second or
     two, then he rises and appears little bothered by this, he
     gets up brushes himself off and starts to pace again, hardly
     even looking at the big man.

                          GORGEOUS GEORGE

              You want to stay down my friend, I
              promise you, you want to stay down.
     Micky ignores this and continues to pace, the big fella grabs
     him and puts him in a headlock and charges him into the stable
     door. There is a terrible noise.




                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)

              Now you fucking stay down boy or you
              won't be coming up next time.
     It appears as though this is going to get messy and any humour
     that might have been around has now evaporated. Micky raises
     his head there is still no damage to speak of. All of a
     sudden he starts jumping up and down like he's warming up,
     throwing a few shadow punches, taking off his shirt. This
     reveals a heavily tattooed and scarred torso, and underneath
     these embellishments is a physique that warrants some respect.

                          GORGEOUS GEORGE (CONT'D)

              This is sick. I am outta here.

                          MICKY -

              You're not going anywhere my friend.
              You stay until the job is done.
     Micky starts pacing, and throwing out a couple of shadow
     punches with his back to Gorgeous George, he still hasn't
     really acknowledged his opponent. Gorgeous George moves in
     for the coup de grace, Micky spins on his feet and catches
     the big man under the jaw.

     CUT TO BLACK

     FADE IN: We see Gorgeous George lying on the floor with a
     head the size of a water melon. There is blood streaming
     out of every orifice in his head - he's in.big trouble. We
     are in slow motion;- there's a lot of activity going on around
     the body on the floor, their mouths are open but we can't
     hear what they are saying, all we can hear is the voice over
     given by Tommy.

               George doesn't wake up. Why do they
               want to go to the trouble of
               explaining why a man died in a
               campsite? These people don't exist
               in society, you can't find them,
               they live under their own laws and
               ignore everybody else's. I am scared,
               I am really fuckin scared.




21   INT. AMUSEMENT ARCADE 1 -- DAY

     We see Turkish with a somewhat serious expression on his
     face he has his customary pint of milk on one side, he takes
     a sip and "ohhhs" and "arrrs" for a while.

                          .TURKISH

               So you're telling me he would have
               run you through if Gorgeous hadn't
               woken up?

                           TOMMY

               No, his Mum stopped it. If his Mum
               hadn't turned up, well, I ' d be pikey
               fuckin sausages.

                           TURKISH

               What were you thinking of? Why the
               fuck did you put Gorgeous George
               into a bare knuckle boxing match two
               days before he had to fight the
               Bomber?

                           TOMMY

               He was half his size.
     He pantomimes a man that would reach his navel

                           TOMMY (CONT'D)

               I didn't expect him to get hurt.

                           TURKISH

               You put the man into a bare knuckle
               boxing match.
     He raises his voice

     Pause there is no correlation as Tommy knows.

                          TOMMY

              We replace the fighter.

                          TURKISH

              Oh what, and hope he doesn't notice?
              And who the fuck are we going to
              replace him with?

                          TOMMY

              John "The Gun?" Or "Mad Fist" Willy?

                          TURKISH

              You're not exactly Mr Current Affairs,
              are you Tommy? Mad Fist went mad,
              and the "Gun" shot himself.

                          TOMMY

              What about Clam Hand Tony?

                          TURKISH

              Got his fingers caught in the till.
              He's no good to anyone.

              He wants cash so he's coming back
              after he has been to a fight.
     There is a serious expression of alarm on Hands's face - the
     camera crashes in.

                          HANDS

              What do you mean a fight, you mean a

               Franky is good at buying stones Doug
               but he's a fuckin liability when it
               comes to gambling. That has cost

25   EXT. AIRPLANE --




     We see the undercarriage of Concorde taking off.

26   INT. BRICK TOP'S PUB --




     Tommy and Turkish walk into a pub and approach the BARMAN.
     They reach the bar.    .            .

                             TURKISH

                 We are here to see Brick Top.
     The barman looks them up and down a bit.      He's not doing
     anything.

                             BARMAN

                 I am very busy at the moment.

                             TURKISH                           ·

                 I am not asking you to break sweat,
               . I am asking you to call Brick Top.

                 Who?

                              TURKISH

                 Brick Top.

                 Well make a call and see if someone
                 else has. Say it's Turkish.
     The barman looks bothered by the fact he has to move but
     wanders off. Turkish looks at the pool table.

                  that pool table?
     They both give the table an eyeball.




                              TOMMY

                  What, potted more balls than any
                  other player? What else can you do

                  Quite a fuckin lot if you nail 'em
                  to it.



     TWO HEAVY LOOKING FELLAS appear out of the woodwork.

                              HEAVY FELLA

                  Yup.   -

                               HEAVY FELLA

                  Follow me.
     The heavy fella opens up the bar and beckons Turkish and
     Tommy through. They go through another door and the corridor
     turns into a mass of dogs barking, snarling 'and whining in
     cages. The mood is sinister..they reach another door, they
     open up and we are introduced to a dog fight. A load of
     HEAVY GEEZERS are commenting on the performance of the dogs,
     one dog is being carried out by a single leg, it's covered
     in blood. Another dog is left in the ring, it too is covered
     in blood but it's survived.

                               TURKISH

                  They can charm the paint off walls
                  these fellas.

27   INT. BACK OF PUB - DOG FIGHT -- NIGHT

     A circle of blunt faces are exchanging money with one another
     A few faces turn round to examine Tommy and Turkish, they
     frown slightly but carry on about their business once they
     see they are accompanied by the muscle.
     The heavy walks over to Brick Top. The heavy taps him on
     the shoulder and whispers. He acknowledges, and gives his
     drink to the heavy. He walks over. There is a cage next to
     Brick Top which has a pit bull in, and Brick Top who is
     carrying a cane pokes it through the cage doors. The dog
     snarls back.

               Shits itself when you put it in the
               ring, but poke .it with a stick and

               We don'c have a Gorgeous anymore.
     Brick Top turns round and indicates that he would like the
     noise around him to drop. It does marginally.

                           BRICK TOP

               You're going to have to repeat that.

                           TURKISH

               We have lost Gorgeous George.
     Brick Top turns round again at the already subdued crowd, he
     doesn't raise his voice but the crowd reacts.

                               BRICK TOP

                  I said keep the noise down.. . .
     A tangible silence between the men reflects Brick Top's
     authority.

                  Well, where did you lose him? He
                  isn't a set of fuckin car keys is

     Brick Top wasn't expecting anything out of Tommy.




                            BRICK TOP

                Oh fuck me your lady friend has got
                a voice. And who might you be
                changing him to, sweetheart?

                            TURKISH

                You won't know him.
     Pause: a look of you're kidding comes over his face.




                            BRICK TOP

                Are you taking the piss?

                            TURKISH

                No, there was an accident.

                            BRICK TOP

                I'll show you a fuckin accident.

                            TURKISH

                You've still got your fight.

                            BRICK TOP

                No, I lose all bets at the bookies.
                You can't change fighters at the
                last minute, so no, I don't have my
                fight do I, you fuckin prat!

                            TOMMY

                You could take bets at the fight.

                            BRICK TOP

                Put a lead on her Turkish,     Before
                she gets bitten.
     Pause

                            BRICK TOP (CONT'D)

                Make sure your man goes down in the
                fourth. You're on thin fuckin ice
                my pedigree chums and I'll be there
                if it breaks.

               you can't bring a dog on a job.

               You can't leave him on his own, not
               to begin with, he gets homesick.

               Homesick, for fucks sake.

                           VINNY

               He does. If he gets the chance he
               runs back to the gypsies' campsite.

               Ask him. It' s like he's got a fuckin
               homing beacon. Give him the chance
               and he's off.

                           SOL

               You're going soft Vin? Here pass me
               a sandwich.
     Vin throws a sandwich to Sol but the dog catches it whilst

     The car has stopped.

               You could land a jumbo fuckin jet in

      Vin is confused as to this last statement.

                  come from behind you. I am not happy

                  Give him something to shut him up.



       Sol throws a plastic squeaky dog ball that was in the front.
       The dog grabs in and swallows it in one gulp. The brothers
       look on in shock.

                              SOL

                  He can't swallow a whole ball.

                              TYRONE

                  He swallowed it.
       The dog looks up having completed the task. Vin who looks
       quite alarmed holds the dog by the ribs and squeezes, there
       is a squeak.




29   EXT. AIRPORT. --

     Doug and Alex are waiting to pick- up Hands.

                           ALEX

                           ALEX

               I got him the Volante.

                           DOUG

               What did I say? What exactly did I
               say?

                           ALEX

               You said get him the Vantage.

                           DOUG

               That's right, I clearly said get him
               the Vantage. So why did you get the
               Volante?                                      ;

                           ALEX

               Because they look the same.

                           DOUG

               The Septuagint scholars mistranslated
               the Hebrew word for "young woman" in
               to the Greek word for "virgin",
               because they thought they looked the
               same, coming up with the prophecy
               "behold a virgin shall conceive and
               bear a son". But there is a world
               of difference between a virgin and a
               young woman like there is between a
               Volante and a fuckin Vantage.
     '.Pause: she thinks about this.

                           ALEX

               Are you saying that the fact that
               your cousin Hands is driving a Valiant
               instead of a Vantage is a profound a
               mistake as a whole religion?

                           DOUG

     Hands and his sidekick Rosebud are coming out of the sliding
     glass doors towards Doug who's now standing by the car with
     his arms crossed. Hands is quite clearly looking for a car.

                               DOUG

                   How about a hug for your old cousin

     The black guys are sitting in the car still.         The occasional

     Tyrone in the van. There's a double set of glass doors.
     Sol pushes them open, and Vinny walks in first, while Sol
     hangs back with the shotgun.

32   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY

     Inside is the MAN with the case, busy filling in a slip, and
     TWO CLERKS behind the betting counter. Vinny doesn't mince
     around and goes straight to the counter, where the HEAD CLERK
     PAULINE, comes up to help.

                  It. belongs to me now.
     Vinny then leans over the counter to get menacing.              Pauline
     looks more than a little concerned

                              VINNY (CONT'D)

                  If you know what's good for...
     He is cut short, as Pauline triggers a button under the
     counter and a security screen comes flying up at a very rapid
     rate of knots protecting all the counters. This has the
     unfortunate consequence of taking Vinny with it. Poor Vin
     is shot straight to the ceiling, all we can see is half a
     body and his desperately searching for ground legs. Needless
     to say this leaves Sol in a bit of a bewildered state. He's
     looking the wrong way at the critical moment and is left
     wondering what happened, not having seen Vince impaled on
     the ceiling. Sol extracts the enormous shotgun.




                           SOL

              Vi nce ? Vince??
     He spins round looking for his colleague. A muffled noise

     A few groans emanate from the other side of the counter.
     Sol panics some more, and decides that emergency action is
     called for.                               .

                              SOL (CONT'D)

     Sol raises the gun and fires into the side .of- the wall.
     There's an enormous explosion and a clear hole is made in
     the side of the wall. The powerful kick from the gun also
     makes Sol momentarily airborne.




33   EXT. BLACK GUYS' VAN -- DAY




     We see Tyrone grimace at the sound of the shotgun.

34   INT. BOOKIES -- DAY




     Sol pulls himself together and marches up to the hole in the
     wall that the shot created and pokes the gun through.

                Drop the screen now! You just seen
                what it did to this wall so think
                what it could do to you.
     Pauline knows she has lost this one and looks genuinely
     scared.

               . Do it. . . . I said do it.
     The screen comes down with a thud. This means that Vince
     comes down with just as serious a thud. He lets out another
     groan.

                            SOL

                How you doing Vince?
     A weakened voice retorts.

                            VINNY

                How do I look like I am doing you

                lot better if you would stop using
                my name.
     Consoled that his colleague is not dead it's back to business
     for Sol. He raises the gun and pulls his fiercest face.

     There is a pause. Sol knows he's fucked. She points to a

               I am not feeling too funny.
     Sol's temper does have a limit.

               Well I am not feeling too fucking

                  Let me see your hands.
     The man holds his hands up. He has got a perfect set of
     five fingers on both hands. Sol puts his head in his hands.
     Pauline and the other clerk put two bags full of coins on
     the counter. Sol picks them up and frowns, he's not happy
     with a bag full of change. He puts his gun down and starts
     to rifle through the bag. Pauline can see Vinny's pistol on
     the counter, dropped after his encounter with the screen.

                fuckin coins?
     Pauline sees her opportunity and grabs the pistol. Sol .goes
     for it too, but he's beaten to it. Sol ducks, pulling Vince
     with him, Pauline lets out a series of shots in their
     direction, Sol counter blasts over the top of the counter.
     The security screen comes flying back up.

                Get me out of here now Sol.
     Vinny does sound convincingly desperate.

                            SOL

                We're going Vin.
     He grabs the bag of copper coins, grabs Vince and marches
     towards the double'doors. They open the first set and then
     they try to open the second. They push the door nothing
     happens. There is no going back. Sol starts to kick the
     glass door, but it doesn't budge. With panic rising swiftly,
     Sol doesn't fuck around he takes aim with the handgun and
     fires, the bullet shatters the glass but it doesn't break
     through, and the bullet now ricochets off both glass doors
     shattering bullet-proof glass all around them. Vinny's panic
     filled eyes attempt to follow its trajectory. Sol is unaware
     of the ricochet and before Vin has time to warn him, Sol
     fires another bullet. Now he observes the problem and waits
     for the inevitable. The bullet tears through the bag of
     coins, which then empties its contents at Vin's and Sol's
     feet. Eventually the bullet hits poor Vince in the thigh.
     Sol sinks to the floor, he has given up. Amongst the yells
     emanating from Vince we can hear Sol's pathetic and desperate
     whimpering.

                What the fuck are you two doing?
     They stumble out into the street. Vinny is in big trouble.
     They throw him into the van. Just as Sol gets into the back,
     we hear kicking noises on metal from the van behind. Tyrone
     pulls out. And the rear doors of the van behind them fly
     open. Franky Four Fingers appears from the back of this ·
     van. He was locked in due to the fact that the black guys'
     van was blocking his exit.

     Tyrone takes an interest in the man from the van (ie Franky)
     seeing that he's carrying a case and the case is connected
     to his wrist.

     28 - as Tyrone parks the van )
     We cut back to Frankie Four Fingers getting out of his van.
     He takes a quick look around and enters the back of his van.
     There he raises the spare tire and picks up his gun, he
     examines it and places it in his trouser front. He then
     turns to exit. At which point there is a loud smash and
     Franky is knocked backwards (as Tyrone hits his van).

     WE CUT TO BLACK.                  '


     WE FADE UP

     (Time-wise, we're now at the end of scene 34)
     Frankie wakes up. He has a trickle of blood dripping down
     the back of his neck, he looks at his watch and panics. He
     kicks the doors a couple of times - nothing happens, but on
     the third kick the doors spring open. Franky brushes himself
     off and makes his way to the bookies.

39   EXT. STREET OUTSIDE BOOKIES --DAY




     We cut to Tyrone. Tyrone clocks the case attached to Franky'
     wrist. Gets out and slams the end of the gun across Franky
     Four Fingers' head. He falls to the ground. Tyrone tries
     to take the case off him but i t ' s handcuffed to his wrist.
     So he has little choice but to pick him up and throw him in
     to the back of the car with the other two.

     Franky's hand   up on a desk and are fiddling with the handcuff,
     whatever they   are trying to break in with snaps off. Vinny
     is frustrated   and illustrates his dissatisfaction.

     Tyrone goes for the big gun and Franky pulls the trigger.
     Nothing happens other than a big click, there is silence for
     a long second and the black guys open their tightly shut
     eyes.                                                      :

     He holds up the diamond. Boris1 eyes follow him as he walks
     back into the room where Franky is and puts the diamond back
     into the case while he's talking and changes the combination.

               rights keep the whole fuckin stone.
     Boris grimaces and pulls out a gun from god knows where, and
     within a second shoots poor Franky in the face. Franky's
     body disappears off the stool that he was sitting on. The
     black guys are stunned into silence.

                           BORIS

               who I am. Now open the case and
               give me.the stone.

     just changed gear and they weren't expecting that.

               Who's next? You have the ten grand
               now give me the stone.

     worryingly close to Sol's head.

     Boris appears little bothered by this and whips out a four
     foot machete that he was concealing about his person. He
     pulls the case towards him and brings the machete down with
     full force. We can tell by the expression on Tyrone's face
     that it must have been some part of Franky's anatomy.
     Pointing to the ground:

     He points to Franky. While he is saying this he bends down
     and picks up the case from the floor and wraps the severed
     arm in newspaper. He then walks out of the shop casual as
     you like.

     Turkish pulls up outside his arcade and has a look around:

     Turkish has another look around the back

     his way to the safe under the floor. He decides to put the
     kettle on, does so, and his attention is caught by something,
     he looks at the cups on the side and sees that one is waiting
     to be made. He stands back and looks at the cupboards he
     sees that they are all open. Then he sees that the kettle
     is already boiled.

     let it ring for a while.

47   EXT. PORTACABIN




     The film stock is 1970s, and things seem more dated. This
     is confirmed by the dress of our man TONY. Tony is standing
     outside a scrap metal yard and he is kicking the door of a
     portacabin.                                             ..

                              TONY

                  Open up Charlie.

                             CHARLIE

                  Fuck off. The only thing I'11 open
                  up is you.

                                TONY

                  could have been one of the other
                  lads, and then think how much trouble
                  you' d be in.

                              CHARLIE

                  You come through that door and you'll
                  be going out prostrate.

                              TONY

                  It doesn't belong to you Charlie.
     He kicks open the door. CHARLIE is standing behind his desk
     holding a pistol directly at Tony. On the table is a bag of
     what we must believe is coke, it's open, and Charlie has it
     all over his nose.                     .

                              TONY (CONT'D)

                  off with other people's gear. How
                  much you put up your nose?
     Charlie opens up, he fires four shots straight into Tony who
     buckles and falls to the floor. Tony seems only shaken and
     he holds his hands out to inspect them, he's bleeding.

                              TONY (CONT'D)

                  Oh you silly cunt.
     Tony stands and walks towards Charlie. Charlie is
     understandably shocked and fires another. It goes straight
     through Tony and we see the blood hit the wall behind.

                              CHARLIE

                  Go down-boy, go down.

47   CONTINUED:

     Tony keeps going for him. Charlie raises the gun and points
     it at Tony's face and fires the last shot. The bullet goes
     straight into his mouth but it went in at an angle and it
     exits his cheek. Tony is standing there with six. bullet
     holes in him and bleeding all over the carpet. As he talks
     blood courses its way down his front and a strong lisp is
     frustrating the words.

                              TONY

                  Ohh you'f in twouble nowf.



     Tony slowly extracts a short sword from behind him. Fear
     has set into Charlie's face and has rendered him useless.

                  Ok so let's get hold of him.

                              DOUG

                  Firstly you gotta understand he's a
                  little strange.                                       .

                           HANDS

              .He could swing from trees wearing
               rubber dresses as far as I am
               concerned, all as I care about is
               whether he can find Franky.

                                                                             4


49   INT. CARAVAN CAMP SITE --DAY




     Turkish and Tommy pull up outside the pikey camp.             Micky's
     Mum is sitting in her chair surrounded by kids.

                              MUM

                  They're very nice Tommy.       Thank you.
     Tommy has produced a bunch of flowers from somewhere.              Turkish
     finds this a great surprise.

                              TURKISH

                  Where did they come from? You're a
                  snake in the grass Tommy.

                              MUM

                  You looking for Micky?

                              TURKISH

                  Hare coursing. The gypsies can't
                  get enough of it.

                              TOMMY

                  What the fuck's a hare?

                  Why don't they call em big rabbits
                  then?

                              TURKISH

                  Because they call em hares.
     Tommy shrugs.

                  So what's coursing?

                              TURKISH

                  They set two lurchers, they are dogs
                  before you ask, on a hare, that's
                  the big rabbit. And the hare has to
                  outrun the dogs.

                              TOMMY

                  What happens if he doesn't?

51   EXT. SEEDY STREET

     Errol is curb crawling down a particularly seedy street in a
     car with John. They come to a halt, at the feet of some
     touter.

                              ERROL

                  Excuse me mate, d'ya know Mullet?
     The man looks a little 'further down the street. Errol follow
     his eyes, squints and seems to focus on something.

                                ERROL (CONT'D)

                  Cheers pal.
     Errol puts on the gas a little-, the car surges forward and
     slows at the feet of Mullet - seedy looking character with
     big ears and a moody haircut, who smokes fat cheap cigars
     and wears his top shirt button fastened.

                              MULLET

                  Errol, John. Alright chaps?     How's
                  the gov'nor?

                  Very well Mullet, I am sure he'll be
                  flattered you inquired.

                  what have you got for us about the
                  gov'nor's bookies?

                              MULLET

                  I did find something out as it
                  happens, I knew a driver who was
                  grafting that day.

     He pulls out a catalogue on fancy caravans and points to the
     picture of the Rolls Royce of caravans.

                  The fight is twice the size. And my
                  mum still needs a new caravan.




                              TURKISH

                  Micky you are lucky we aren't worm
                  food after your performance, I think
                  buying a tart's mobile palace is a
                  little fuckin rich.



     There is a pause while Micky frowns.       Turkish looks a little
     sheepish.

               me a favour?

               bet. If I win I get the caravan, if
               I lose I'l l do the fight for free.
     Turkish considers this, uneasily.       He looks at the dogs they
     look keen and fit.

                  Oh no Tommy I wasn't saying you can't
                  shoot, I know you can't shoot. What
                  I was saying is that six pound piece
                  of shit stuck in your trousers there
                  would do more damage if you fed it
                  to em.

                  lifting a body in one piece.
                  Apparently the best thing to do is
                  cut the corpse up into six pieces
                  and pile it all together.

              through a body that weighs two hundred
              pounds in about eight minutes that
              means that a single pig can consume

                Jesus Tone you know how it is.
     Btt turns to Hands.

                            BTT

                Give us your wallet Hands.
     Hands makes eyes and digs into his back pocket and produces
     his wallet. BTT takes out some notes and proffers them to
     Mullet, Mullet nervously reaches forward. As quick as you
     like Btt has Mullet by the collar and pulls Mullet into the
     car. He then raises the electric window on Mullet's throat
     until it has fastened Mullet to the roof of the vehicle.




                             BTT (CONT'D)

     Mullet has already gone pink.

                You can take as long as you like
                Mullet.
     Btt starts to pull away so Mullet has to keep walking with
     him.

                            MULLET

                Fuckin hell what are you doing?

                            BTT

                I am driving down the street with
                your head stuck in my window. What
                do you think I am doing you penis?
     He does the window up a bit tighter. And grabs him by the
     nose. He pulls a face when he smells his breath.

                            BTT (CONT'D)

                You been using dog shit tooth paste

                  a job for a pair of brothers who
                  have a pawn shop in Smith Street.

                  see what I can do to you.
     He puts his foot down and Mullet loses his footing, and is
     dragged along.                                      '.

     He points to Mullet. BTT pulls an, 'oh yes I forgot about
     him1 face. He doesn't even look at Mullet. He lowers the
     window, and Mullet falls by the way, in god knows what
     condition.

     The music continues, and we have a montage of the black guys
     dealing with Bullet Tooth Tony and Hands as they arrive at
     the pawn shop. We see the corpse, we see Hands get irate
     and it looks like it's going to be the end of the black fellas
     again. The black guys try to whip out the big gun but Tony
     disarms them and takes the gun off them. The music ends
     along with the scene when Sol breaks.

     Tommy and Turkish are looking on to the burned out caravan. .
     They are in shock. There is a whole gathering of dodgy,
     angry looking pikies standing around, giving Turkish and
     Tommy some bad looks.

     to the side and hits a lamp post. They crash and the boot

      Tony starts to build himself a complicated looking weapon
      under the table, unseen by the black guys. He takes bits

      know it. They start to reverse. BTT lets the odd chicken
      cluck out the corner of his mouth, Vinny misses his step and

       still drying his hands, they can see that he's carrying a

       opportunity to duck. Hands dives for cover too and drops
       the bag. A continuation of bullets comes flying through the

      opened and a man brings out Lincoln. Lincoln is in bad shape

                you've heard one or two of those
                stories. For example, did you hear
                about the three black fellas that
                did a very bad thing, however they
                made some effort to redeem that very
                bad thing, so the governor saw fit
                not to kill em. He thought it would
                be a more advantageous concept to
                let them kill each other and let the
                survivor live to tell the tale.
                That way everybody wins, well, all
                except the two that died of course.
      We look at the table where we see three large kitchen knives
      sitting provocatively. Tyrone rushes for one of the blades
      grabs it and runs at Vin, Vin sidesteps and Tyrone keeps
      running straight into the arms of Errol who raises his gun
      at the last moment. Tyrone slides the blade into Errol 's
      ribs and Errol fires a shot straight at Tyrone. The bullet
      passes through Tyrone and hits John in the throat . Vin,
      Lincoln and Sol are left wondering what the fuck has just
      happened .

                If they weren't sniffing the dust
                they where flicking the ash. And
                never trust who puts anything other
                than a finger up his nose.
      KEN, another of Brick Top's men, appears from somewhere and
      approaches Tony with another heavy, SEAN.

                              KEN

                Follow me.
      They do and end up in a corridor. The door .shuts behind
      them and the door in front hasn't yet opened. Ken turns
      around and faces Tony.

                              KEN (CONT'D)

                Did you know that it was my cousin
                Lorrie you stabbed?
      There is a pause.    The situation is volatile.

                             BTT

                Yes I know I stabbed a man called
                Lorrie, but no I didn't know he was
                related to a tub a shit.
      Ken knows it's on.

                             KEN

                Shut that door Sean.

                             BTT

                Lock that fuckin door Sean.
      BTT takes a step forward and puts his hand, into the back of
      his trousers. He starts to growl.

                              BTT (CONT'D)

                 You're a big man, but I don't care
                 if you're ten foot fuckin tall, you
                 still got eight pints of blood and
                you'll bleed like any bastard. And
              . when.I drop .ya, and I will fuckin
                drop ya, I'll open you up like a
                packet of crisps.



      Pause to take in what has just been said then he continues.

                              BTT (CONT'D)

                You're a bully Ken, but remember, I
                am a bigger bully.

      The door opens and they are interrupted by another HEAVY.

                Ha, Ken what' s going on? Bring em
                through. The governor wants to see

      Ken is relieved by the interruption, and he leads the way
      with a truculent "you're lucky" stare. They enter Brick
      Top's office.

                we paid for it. So I am going to
                have a drink and let you two discuss
                what you have to discuss.
      Btt walks to the bar.   Ken is sitting there with Sean.

                Alright big man, I hope you aren't
                bitter about your cousin Lorrie.
      If you listen carefully, you will hear a slight zip of flies
      being undone.

                 to me Tony you're a dead fuckin...
      Brick top frowns at Ken, and Ken shuts up quickly.

                             BRICK TOP

                 What did you do to upset Ken, Tony?
      Tony shrugs

                 He's pissed in my fuckin pocket,

      Ken shows off a wet-sided jacket and a damp set of trousers.

                             BRICK TOP

                 Do shut up Ken.   That was a bit
                 naughty Tony.
      Tony shrugs. Brick Top puts his hands in to his pocket and
      withdraws the stone. We cut to Hand's expression.

                             HANDS

                 Well come on, let's have a look.
      Brick Top passes the stone to Hands. All goes quiet while
      everybody focuses on the stone. Hands lifts it up to his
      eye.

                             HANDS (CONT'D)

                 What are you playing at? -
      He drops the stone: it smashes on the ground.

117 ' INT. VAN -- NIGHT

      We fade out of black to Micky's pov. Thisis shot in slow
      motion. Micky opens his eyes, in the backof.a large van,
      there is only one faint light that moodilyilluminates his
      tired eyes.

                            TURKISH

                attention to what you are doing.
      Micky just yawns.

               Anderson so don't get too clever, he
               used to be a pro. Just keep moving

               go when push has come to shove.

118   INT. WAREHOUSE                                -    '

      A temporary ring has   been erected, four scaffolding posts
      with welded on hoops   make the arena, the ropes that are
      threaded through the   hoops are industrial nylon and free of
      padding. Around the    ropes it's starting to fill. Brick Top
      approaches Salt Pete   and Jack 'the all seeing eye'.

                            SALT, PETER

                I hope we gonna get a better show

119   INT. BACK OF WAREHOUSE




      Brick Top is standing in front of Micky whose eyes are still
      semi open.

                            BRICK TOP

                What's wrong with you? You stoned?
                Is he fuckin stoned?

                He's like that before a fight.
      He turns his attention to Micky.

                           BRICK TOP

               Now you know when you're going down?

                              TURKISH

               Of course he knows when he's going
               down.

                           KEN

               Hey fuck face, who's speaking to
               you? He asked him didn't he?

               Fuck face? I like that, I ' l l have
               to use that one next time -I want to

               The fourth... or was it the fifth..

                           BRICK TOP

               There's a campsite full of pikies
               that might not think you're so fuckin
               funny when they 'are putting the flames
               out on their children's backs.
      Cut to a shot of Brick Top's boys lighting a cigarette in
      the car outside the pikies.




120   INT. WAREHOUSE

      Micky appears from a small door at the back of the warehouse.
      He approaches the ring accompanied with shouts of
      encouragement and counter shouts. He's wearing a pair of
      semi cut tracksuit bottoms and a t-shirt with grease marks
      down the front. Turkish walks behind him, Micky still looks
      bored. He climbs into the ring. Then from the same door as
      the one through Micky came out walks a larger character with
      a nose that appears to have seen countless rounds with a
      frying pan: HORACE 'GOOD NIGHT1 ANDERSON.

                            THE REFF

                Alright lads no eye gouging no biting.
                Do your worst. Back to your corners.



      We drift again into Micky's pov, his world is becoming more
      and more surreal. He can faintly hear Turkish whispering
      words to him, but he's not really listening. A bell comes
      from somewhere, and Micky instinctively walks to the center
      of the ring. "Good night" is already there, they pace one
      another for a second or two, Micky avoids a punch or two and
      then he takes a hard one and he knows it, we flash to white,
      Micky's in trouble: he lets one of his missiles go and BANG
      it shakes "good night" to his core, all goes quiet. We go
      to super slow motion: his knees buckle and "good night" is
      in trouble. Micky maintains a frown as he watches his
      opponent's knees threaten to betray him. The crowd tries to
      digest what is happening. After a period of silence reality
      dawns. Brick Top mouths the words in silence."Don1t go down
      you fucker". The crowd wants Micky to finish the job. But
      common sense reins back the coup de grace. "Good night"
      eventually regains control of his legs and stumbles forward,
      after a few sleepy punches he starts to provide a serious
      onslaught.




                            TURKISH

                I don't like the look of this Tommy,
                bring the van up to the back door.
      This goes on for two rounds (which is montage down to a few
      seconds). We go in the mind of poor Micky. We break the
      music just as it's starting to look dangerous... The bell
      goes and Micky walks to the wrong corner. Turkish pulls him
      back to his corner.

                            TURKISH (CONT'D)

               They are on ya. You got to hurt him
               Micky. Otherwise we are
               rumbled.... you hear me Micky? Do
               -something, it looks like it' s rigged.
      Micky goes out again his hands are low, BANG there is a flash
      of white as Micky goes down in the dirt. Dust rises from
      where he fell. He gets up quickly, his hands are still low,
      BANG he goes down again, in no time he's up.




                                              (CONTINUED)





120   CONTINUED:    -

      BANG: he hits the ground again and this time when he hits
      the deck, he penetrates the dust covered floor, like i t ' s
      made out of water. He falls through the water like he's
      sinking; his eyes are open and he can't breathe, he continues
      to fall, but he's unpanicked (he is now Micky 1). When Micky
      1 looks up he can see himself in the corner of the ring takin
      kidney punches from Good Night, he's winded and only semi-
      conscious (this is Micky 2). Micky 1 makes the effort to
      swim up and tries to penetrate the floor but he's stuck he
      can't get through. Micky 2 takes more punishment in the
      ring, as Micky 1 ' s hand continues to try to break the
      underside of the floor but it stretches like rubber and forces
      Micky 1 down again. Micky 1 looks up again and sees how
      much trouble Micky 2 ' s in the ring. Micky 1 is panicking
      now, he's running out of oxygen and Micky 2's being beaten,
      Micky 1 starts -to sink again but now flames tickle the bottom
      of his feet he looks up. and sees Micky 2 being smashed to
      hell, his body eventually collapses and Micky 2 falls through
      the floor. And as the latter falls through, Micky 1 manages
      to rise from the depths and his punch manages to perforate
      the surface. The punch continues its trajectory and has the
      power to fell a red blooded rhino.... it catches "Good Night"
      on the jaw and it's good night for "Good Night" it's unlikely
      that he'll awake in the next hour. Dear oh dear everybody
      is in trouble.



      Again we cut to the reactions of the relevant parties.

                               TURKISH (CONT'D)

                   Tommy get the van.




                               TOMMY

                   I have it, it's waiting.
      Turkish jumps into the ring and grabs Micky.

                               TURKISH

                   We are off Micky, hold tight, and
                   move quickly. ,
      Turkish pulls Micky away. It's not as hard as it might be
      trying to get out, because the crowd seems to have found its
      own disputes, chairs start to fly. Brick Top's boys are
      frustrated in the mayhem. Brick Top calmly dials into his
      mobile telephone. It rings.

                                                                     1

      Darren picks up the phone.

                                DAREN      .

                   If you would you like to speak to
                   your friends, you'll have to speak a
                   little -louder.

121   CONTINUED:

      We pull back to see four slumped heads in the car and blood
      staining the windscreen. Brick Top calmly puts the phone
      down.

                               BRICK TOP

                   Right lets get outta here.
      Brick Top is looking every which way and trying to get out
      of there, accompanied by Ken.

                               BRICK TOP (CONT.'D)

                   Where's the car Ken?




                                  KEN

                   I t ' s coming now.

                               BRICK TOP

                   We are outta here.
      They come out of a side entrance, their car pulls round the
      corner and screeches to a halt. Brick Top opens the door as
      he is about to get in, he's eyes widen to the size of saucers
      as FOUR MEN (who we recognize from the wake) are sitting in
      the place of his driver. They both have sawed-off shotguns
      and empty four barrels into the chest of Brick Top and Ken.
      The car spins away, leaving their twitching bodies on the
      dirt.

                                                                       :


122   INT. BAD BOY LINCOLN'S HOUSE                                 .




      Hands, Doug and Bullet Tooth have Vin, Sol and Bad Boy Lincol
      in tow. They look at the front room of Lincoln's house.

                               HANDS

                   Very nice Lincoln.

                               BTT

                   Next door.
      They open the door.

123   INT. BAD BOY LINCOLN'S SITTING ROOM.




      This room is a complete mess. All the colony leather has
      been chewed up beyond recognition. They all grimace at the
      smell. The dog comes running up

                   It's a bit funky in here.
      BTT opens a window.       The dog looks extremely relieved to see
      someone.

                                    HANDS

                   You keep a good house Lincoln.      So

      He points to a pile of chewed up cushions.

                   Where?

                   We left it in a box over there...
                   somewhere.
      He walks over and finds the remains of the box.

                                    VINNY (CONT'D)

      Tony is not sure about this.

      Hands does a movement that represents a knife across the
      throat.

                             BTT

                 That's a bit strong isn't it?

                 You wouldn't have a problem if it
                 was a person.

                               BTT

                 But it's not, it's a dog and I have
                 never done a dog.

                 My heart bleeds.
      There is another pause

                  Stick a knife in his guts and see if
                  it's got a diamond in there? I'll
                  hold it still and'you open it up.
      Tony looks positively unsure and rocks his head from side to
      side.

                 Well do it to you as well if it makes
                 you feel any better.
      Cut to Tony having some problems trying to get hold of the
      awkward dog. The dog starts to squeak. Tony passes the
      blade to Hands.

                                BTT

                 I t ' s squeaking.

                               HANDS

                 What, you've never heard a dog squeak
                 before?... Hold him still.
      The dog isn't sure about this either.      Vin is in a panic and
      suddenly.

                            VINNY

                 Stop! I can see it.   I can see the
                 stone.
      Hands at the point of entry stops. Vinny hops over to the
      stone and picks it up. Tony lets the dog stand but keeps a
      grip oh the collar. The dog is relieved to be semi-liberated.
      Hands is still on his knees armed with an incredulous stare.

                             HANDS

                 Well let's see it.
      Vinny holds it up. There's a sense of relief. He then throws
      the stone, it cuts through the air. And the dog seeing
      .another projectile runs to intercept it. There's a pause
      while all now focus again on the dog. This is digested
      literally and mentally. The dog recognizes all the attention
      it's receiving. And goes through the motions of swallowing
      it. Hands attempts an approach. The dog understandably
      feels uncomfortable about the advancing vanguard and decides
      emergency action is needed, and seeing the open window
      launches itself out of it.

                 Well you might have noticed that we
                 have moved, you should have fed him
                 more, a dog will never leave you if
                 you feed it properly. It was a good
                 dog, he had a little flatulence
                 problem but was a good dog.

      Cut to freeze frame of Sol, Vin, BTT and Hands stopped dead

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT - MUSIC OVER

MIDTOWN. A Brunette Beauty crosses in front of a stack of
cabs, her sheer dress clinging to her remarkable body.
A Club in THE MEATPACKING DISTRICT. A long line waits to get
in. A couple of Gorgeous Girls show up at the velvet rope and
are promptly" let inside.
SOHO. A Crowd spills out of a Bar and onto the sidewalk. A
Confident Knock Out in jeans and a tank top laughs, drinking
a beer out of the bottle.

             Ahhhh... The sweet, uncomplicated
             satisfaction of The Younger Woman. That
             fleeting age when everything just falls
             right into place. It's magic time and it
             can render any man, anywhere --
             absolutely helpless. Some say I'm an
             expert on The Younger Woman. Guess that's
             'cause I've been dating them for over
             forty years...







INTO AN EMPTY FRAME COMES HARRY LANGER

What is it about him? Could be his eyes, the turn of his
mouth...something about this guy is just so damn appealing.
Maybe it's just the way he wears the Young Slinky Girl on his

Harry passes a table where a BEATEN SIXTY YEAR OLD dines with
his AGE APPROPRIATE, WELL-FED WIFE. IN SLOW MOTION, Harry and
The Beaten Man catch each other's glance.

 NT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION

Harry ENTERS all over again. This time he looks older,
something in his walk and the boxy cut of his jacket. With
him is a regular looking, nothing-to-write-home-about WOMAN

IN HER FIFTIES.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          No, come on, let's be honest. ..a dame
          really my age. . .







INT. CHIC EATERY - HARRY'S IMAGINATION - TAKE TWO

Again, the identical set up. Harry ENTERS again. This time he
looks ten years older. The bounce to his step is gone. The
twinkle in his eye, long dead. On his arm is a 63 YEAR OLD
BATTLE AX, built just like Harry. The Maitre'd reluctantly
shows them to a shitty table.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          There you have it. The story in a
          nutshell. Not exactly debonair, am I?
              (Harry TRIPS, his wife
               looks disgusted)
          Awww, man, it's down right sad. Look at
          me. I look like I'm about to die. God
          help me. I do not want to die.

                                            SMASH CUT TO:





                                                         3.














A LONG STRETCH OF PRISTINE COUNTRY ROAD - THE HAMPTONS - DAY

A Silver Mercedes convertible bursts into FRAME. Harry's
behind the wheel, shades, smoking a cigar, livin' large. Next
to him sits a thoroughbred of a girl. An "IT" Girl. Smart,
sexy and built for fun. She has perfected flirting to an art.
Her hand rests on Harry's neck. There's a good thirty year
age difference between them. Her name is MARIN. She SINGS
along with Ja Rule, now coming from a CD.

                    MARIN

              ( singing)
          To all my thugs that be livin' it
          up, we say, what I do. To all my...
              (stops)
          Oh! This is it. Make a right.

                    HARRY

              (admiring the
               neighborhood)
          So baby, you're rich... .

                    MARIN

          Well, my mother is, sort of. Not
          really...

                    HARRY

          If she lives within a mile of here, she's
          rich.

                    MARIN

          I guess a hit play will buy you a house
          in The Hamptons.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to meet your mother.

                    MARIN

          No you wouldn't. I mean, she's
          great. She's totally brilliant, but
          she's not your type.

                    HARRY

          You're overlooking one of the great
          things about me. I don't have a type.

                    MARIN

              (very directly)
          She's over thirty.
Harry looks to Marin, feigning hurt.

                    MARIN

          Oh, what?! Like you don't know you
          have a slight reputation for...




                                                         4.










Just then the CAR PHONE RINGS. Harry keeps looking at Marin.

                    HARRY

          -- For what?
Harry waits. RINGGG!
He doesn't look away.

                    MARIN

          For never dating anyone over 30.
          Don't look at me like that.

                    HARRY

          It's just not true.

                    MARIN

          Okay. Sorry. Over 31?

                     HARRY

          Oh, so you wait 'til we get out to The
          Hamptons to let me know you're a wise
          ass.
               (answers phone)
          Hold on. . .
               (then to Marin)
          It just so happens, my dear, that women
          of a certain age, don't date me. You ever
          think of it that way? No, it's always me.
          You dames are all alike.
               (then into phone)
          Hey...

                    MARIN

              (amused, to herself)
          Dames...
Marin continues singing along with Ja Rule as Harry
confidently slips his hand onto her thigh.

                    BARRY

              (into phone)
          Vh-huh.. .I'll call back Monday. Who
          else? Monday... Monday... Say you couldn't
          find me. Who?
              (glances at Marin, she's
               not listening)
          I'll call her later. No, I have it.
Harry hangs up, doesn't look in Marin's direction to see if'
she caught that. This brand of cool is about not playing that
card. Marin turns toward him, she has been listening. They've
reached the end of the road, sand dunes, long lilting grass
and the ocean stretch before them.




                                                          5.











                    MARIN

              (all business)
          Make a right, left at the second
          fence.
Marin turns up the CD, getting herself out of whatever just
came over her, looks out the window.

                    HARRY

          Have I mentioned how gorgeous your
          breasts look in this sweater?

                    MARIN

              (blushing)
          Yes you have actually.

                     HARRY

          So it would be too much to mention it
          again. . .
Marin laughs, softening, as Harry turns down a dirt driveway,
driving toward a DREAM BEACH HOUSE.

                    HARRY

          Wow. It's the perfect beach house.

                    MARIN

          I know. My mother doesn't know how
          to do things that aren't perfect.

                    HARRY

          Which explains you.
That got her. Harry parks. She looks over at him but he's
grabbing some cigars for his shirt pocket, then looks up at
her with an innocent look that suggests he did not just say
such a lovely thought.

                    MARIN

              (trying to keep up with
               him)
          Yeah, okay, right...
They both grab their H
                     overnight bags and step out of the car.

                     ARRY

          So, what are we gonna do out here,
          just the two of us, for two whole
          days?
Marin sets her bag down, walks to Harry, wraps her arms
around his neck.

                    MARIN

          Tell me the truth, are you at all
          glad we waited?




                                                            6.











                       HARRY

             I'm incredibly glad we're finally
             going to do it.
                 (she's a bit disappointed)
             If that's the same as being glad we
             waited, then baby doll, I'm ecstatic.
Marin smiles then kisses him. He's one of those guys that
lets you kiss them.

                       HARRY

                 (slaps her tush)
             Let's go for a swim, how long will
             it take you to change?

                       MARIN

             Two minutes.
Marin starts UNBUTTONING HER SWEATER as she dances
seductively toward the front door, then notices Harry's
cigars.

                         MARIN

             Oh Har... No smoking in the house. My
             Mom doesn't allow it.

                       HARRY

             But she allows you to strip in the
             front yard and bring men you're
             dating here to...

                       MARIN

             She doesn't know everything I do...Or
             when I do it.. or where I do it.
She SLIPS OFF her sweater and DROPS IT ON HARRY'S HEAD.







INT. HOUSE

It's one of those great Beach Houses. Light filled and warm
with spectacular views of the sandy landscape wrapping around
the rear of the house. Marin, now in a tight tank, tight
pants, gives Harry the grand tour as she continues to
undress.

                       MARIN

                 (TAKING OFF her belt)
             The fabulous living room, perfect for
             entertaining an intimate group of friends
             or that special someone.
                 (DROPS her belt then
                  UNBUTTONS Harry's shirt)
             Behind me, the requisite Hampton's deck
             complete with pool and ocean view.




                                                           7.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

              (UNBUCKLES Harry's belt)
          Your pants, please...

                    HARRY

          Ladies first.
Marin provocatively UNZIPS her pants and wriggles out of
them. She's now in a TINY TANK AND BIKINI PANTIES.

                    MARIN

          Gourmet kitchen's to your left
          where tonight I will whip you up a
          culinary feast of Mac and Cheese.
Marin HEARS Harry's ZIPPER UNZIP. She turns, her EYES
WIDENING as Harry's PANTS land on a chair. Harry is now down
to his Boxers, an Open Shirt and a fearless smile.

                    MARIN

              (smiling)
          .. O-kay, going quickly now...
          Master bedroom is that away...
They arrive in a warmly decorated GUEST BEDROOM.

                     M


                     ARIN

          And this as they say on 'Cribs',
          your favorite show, is where the
          magic happens. Do we like it? Going
          once, going twice ...

                    HARRY

          Sold.
Harry takes Marin's hand and pulls her OUT OF FRAME and ONTO
THE BED. She playfully rolls on top of him. His hands cup her
ass.

                    MARIN

          You know when I first started
          auctioneering someone told me if I was
          nervous to just picture everyone in the
          audience in their underwear. This sort of
          gives that a whole new meaning.

                    HARRY

          Why? You're not nervous now, are you?

                    MARIN

          I'm always a little nervous.

                    HARRY

              (removing his hands)
          So put on your bathing suit. I brought
          some champagne, I'll put it on ice.




                                                         8.











                    MARIN

          Me like you, Harry Langer.
She bounces off him like a kid and disappears into the
bathroom.
Harry lies there alone for a second. Catches his breath. He
sits up, feet on the floor, shoulders hunched, clears his
throat, bangs on his chest. He waits a sec then stands with a
stiffness that for the first time suggests he is not a that
young man.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Now wearing only his Boxer Shorts, Harry crosses through the
Living ROOM, singing 'Livin' It Up' to himself. He reaches into
his bag and lifts out Two Bottles of Crystal. He sees himself in
the mirror, sucks in his gut.







INT. KITCHEN

Well stocked, the best of everything. Harry opens the door to the
fridge and just as HE DISAPPEARS BEHIND IT, the BACK DOOR OPENS
and TWO WOMEN ENTER from a beach walk, in the middle of a lively
conversation.
One of them is ERICA, Marin's Mother. The other is Erica's
Younger Sister, ZOE.
ERICA is in her mid-fifties and is a poster girl for growing old.
It's actually hard to imagine 55 looking any better. And not
because she looks 35, but because she makes 55 look graceful and
right. Erica is the "girl most likely" who went beyond
expectations but didn't realize until recently that being sure of
herself was a handicap. She doesn't try to be intimidating, she
just is.
Her sister, ZOE is in her forties. Zoe's the loose one. She
wears draw string pants and a T-shirt that says, "BOYS LIE".
The Women stop mid-sentence when they notice the REFRIGERATOR
IS WIDE OPEN. Then they SEE A PAIR OF BARE MEN'S LEGS poking

                     E

out from UNDER THE DOOR. They don' t move.

                     RICA

          Oh God. What is this?
Erica nods to Zoe, gesturing a nearby knife. Zoe grabs the knife.
Harry pokes his head out from behind the fridge, equally confused.

                    ERICA

              (in control)
          Okay, stay right where you are. We have a
          knife.




                                                         9.











                    HARRY

              (eyeing the knife)
          Do you... live here?

                    ERICA

          Okay, Mister, look, I'm gonna dial
          911 and you're not gonna move. Zoe,
          hand me the phone.
              (reaches out to Zoe
               without looking at her)

                    HARRY

          You don't understand. I'm a friend
          of your daughter's.
With that, Harry SHUTS the fridge door. The Women see he's
naked except for a Pair of Boxers. They both GASP. Zoe
FUMBLES the phone over to Erica who dials quickly..

                    ERICA

          Yeah? I don't think so. My daughter's in
          the city and you what, wandered in
          here,like high on Ecstasy..?.
              (looks at phone)
          Shit. I dialed 8-1-1.
              (redials)

                    HARRY

              (calmly starts to move)
          Honestly, if you just...

                    ERICA

          Back off. She was in the Israeli
          army. She can break you in half.
Zoe can't believe she just said that -- no truth in it
whatsoever.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          Yes. I have an intruder in my
          house. 29 Daniels Lane, Sagaponack.

                    HARRY

          I'm dating your daughter Marin. She
          invited me here for the weekend.
          She's in her room right now,
          changing.

                     ERICA

              (GASPS even louder, really
                   scared now)
          You're dating my daughter?




                                                        10.











                    HARRY

              (amused)
          Now who would've thought that would
          be worse news?
With that, Marin ENTERS, in a tiny bikini, sees Harry in his
shorts, Zoe holding the knife and Erica frozen, holding the
phone.

                      MARIN

          Oh, fuck.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God.
              (into phone)
          I'm sorry. False alarm. Yeah, no, I'm
          sure. No, he's not a burglar
              (with enormous difficulty)
          He's dating my daughter.

                    MARIN

          Mom, I had no idea you were coming out
          this weekend, you said you had to write.

                    ERICA

          I do. I thought I'd do it out here.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, this is really....

                      ERICA

          Awkward.

                    MARIN

          Totally.. .but....
              (starts laughing)
          You gotta admit, sorta funny You thought
          he was a burglar? In his boxer shorts?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, well, the world's nuts, I
          don't know the man. . .

                    MARIN

              (still laughing)
          I'm sorry, it's not really funny.
          I'm an idiot. I should've told you
          I was bringing someone out.

                    E


                      RICA

          No, no, I should've told you we
          were coming. Well. Anyway, here we
          are.
               (waves to Harry)
          Hello. I'm the mother.




                                                        11.










All three Women turn to Harry who now dangles a long Lobster
shaped oven mitt over his "privates"...

                    HARRY

          Harry Langer. How are ya?

                     MARIN

          Yes. Sorry... Mom, this is my friend,
          Harry. Harry, my Mom, Erica... my Aunt,
          Zoe.
               (they all shake hands)
          Harry's sort of a new friend. I think I
          mentioned him in an e-mail. We just,
          totally spur of the moment thought we'd
          get out of the city for a few days.

                    ERICA AND ZOE

          Of course...Right...Great...

                    ERICA

              (can't look at him)
          Honey, does Harry have a robe?

                     HARRY

              (backing out)
          You know what? Actually, I think I should
          just take off. Let you gals enjoy your
          weekend...
Marin shoots her Mom a look. Help!

                    ERICA

          No, no, no. Don't be silly. Uh, look,
          here's what we'll do. Zoe and I will
          leave. We took a great walk on the beach,
          we'll go into town for lunch. You two
          stay. Harry, apologize about the near
          arrest.

                      HARRY

          No, you were impressive. Very strong,
          very... "macho".

                    ERICA

              (a little thrown)
          I don't think I was exactly "macho"

          ...


                    HARRY

          Trust me, if I ever catch a guy in
          his underwear in my refrigerator I
          hope I'm half the man you were, Mrs
          uh...




                                                        12.











                    ERICA

              (already hating him)
          Yeah. Okay. Whatever...
Marin watches. Dying.

                    HARRY

          All righty then...I'm definitely gonna
          hit the road.
              (salutes Erica and Zoe)
          Ladies...sensational meeting you.
              (then to Marin)
          Doll, call me.

                    ZOE

          Hold on. Hold on. Let's not get so
          dramatic here. What are we four
          teenagers? We're all sophisticated
          people. Why can't we all stay, for the
          weekend? Your mother's got work to do
          I've got papers to grade. You'll do your
          thing, whatever that is and if we want to
          hang together, we'll hang together. If we
          don't, we don't. There's no reason why
          any of us should give up this spectacular
          weekend.

                    MARIN

          Seriously. I can handle it.

                    ZOE

          I can totally handle it.

                    ERICA

              (on the spot)
          I mean, well, I can "handle" it...
The Women all look to Harry. He looks at Marin. She's hard to
resist.

                    HARRY

          It can only go up from here.

                                                   CUT TO:








HARRY AND MARIN

Walking past SHOPS on the MAIN DRAG IN EAST HAMPTON. They are
both licking ice cream cones. CAMERA STAYS BEHIND THEM.

                     Z


                     OE (V.O.)

          He's obviously a penis substitute.




                                                        13.














ERICA AND ZOE

Are paced 20 feet behind them, carrying groceries.

                    ZOE

          I mean a father substitute.

                    ERICA

          Except he's older than her father. I
          can't even look at them. What is she
          doing with a guy that age?

                    ZOE

          Marin was how old when you guys broke up?

                    ERICA

          Five years ago, so. ..twenty-three.

                    ZOE

          Okay, so she was old enough not to
          feel Dave was walking out on her.

                    ERICA

          Is that supposed to mean Dave walked out
          on me? Why do people assume when you
          break up after twenty years that the
          guy's the one who wanted out? Just
          because once we broke up he shtupped
          everything that moved...

                    ZOE

          Easy cowgirl. I didn't mean it that way.
          Just trying to figure out why such a
          smart girl is always with the wrong guy.







CLOSE ON A YOUNG FRENCH GIRL IN AN APRON


                    YOUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Mme. Barry, que je puis vous obtenir
          aujourd'hui?
The Girl stands BEHIND THE CHEESE COUNTER in:







THE BAREFOOT CONTESSA

A Gourmet Market in East Hampton. The clientele in here is as
rich looking as the food. Erica stands on the other side of
the Cheese Counter.

                    ERICA

          Bonjour je veux une partie de votre
          pate merveilleux et de votre
          meilleur fromage absolu de chevre.




                                                        14.










Harry and Marin shop near by. Harry listens to Erica out of
one ear.

                    HARRY

          That's impressive.

                    MARIN

          She started French lessons after she and
          my Dad split up. Part of her "Keep Busy,
          Don't Look Back" program. She's
          practically fluent now.

                    ERICA

              (turning back to Marin)
          Marin, au cas ou nous prende un desset ou
          devrions jefaire quelgue chose?

                    MARIN

              (with an impeccable
               accent)
          Laissons quelque chose d'achat. Et
          ce grand gateau de chocolat?

                    HARRY

          Hey, not bad.. .

                    MARIN

              (shrugs)
          Yeah...well. ..I am fluent. Be right
          back.
Marin crosses to the dessert counter. Erica turns back and
catches Harry checking out Marin's ass. He smiles as he licks
his ice cream. Erica rolls her eyes then spots another Older
Guy with a Leggy Girl twenty-five years his junior.

                    ERICA

          It's an epidemic.
Then Erica notices who's next to her at the cheese counter.
She sees her Sister, Zoe, reading a cheese label with her
glasses on and next to Zoe are two sad looking Old Women in
their Eighties with their arms linked. Almost woozy, Erica is
snapped out of it when she is handed her package.

                     Y


                     OUNG FRENCH GIRL

          Merci madame.
Erica heads down the aisle, passing Harry whose back is to
her. Just as she passes, he turns and almost bumps into her.

                    ERICA

              (backing off)
          Woops. Sorry.




                                                           15.











                      HARRY

          My fault.
They so very badly do not want to actually touch. Erica
hesitates. Harry gestures for her to go first then walks
alongside her.

                    ERICA

          So, Harry... What do you do?

                    HARRY

          I'm one of the owners of a record
          company among other things...

                    ERICA

          Oh, really? Which record company?

                    HARRY

          Drive by Records.

                    ERICA

              (appalled at the name)
          "Drive By" Records??? Is that a
          joke? What is that?

                    HARRY

          It's a Hip Hop label.

                    ERICA

          Hip Hop? Oh, rap? Oh, right. Well.
              (with disdain)
          Okay. That's... "interesting"...

                    HARRY

          Let me see if I get where you're
          headed here. . .

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry, but, look, you know I hate
          rap, I mean I do. It's sort of violent
          and crude for my taste, not to mention
          just a tad misogynistic.

                    HARRY

          Hey, a lot of people see rapping as
          poetry.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but come on, how many words
          can you rhyme with 'Bitch'?
Erica places her groceries on the check out counter.

                    MARIN

              (joining Harry)
          How we doin?




                                                        16.











                    HARRY

          Should've left when she tried to arrest
          me.







INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT

Marin serves plates of pasta with lobster. Zoe pours wine and
Erica tosses a salad. Harry is the only one sitting.

                    MARIN

          So, Mom, how's the new play? You gettin'
          happy with it?
Marin places a plate in front of Harry then runs her finger
along "the nape of his neck. They smile at each other as she
continues on. Erica notices, tries not to respond.

                    ERICA

          Well, the thing with me is that I'm about
          90% hard word, 10% talent and so far the
          talent part hasn't exactly kicked in yet.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, right...

                    HARRY

          What's your play about?
Marin and Zoe stop what they are doing and turn to Erica.
She's hesitant to reveal this.

                    ERICA

          About? Well, I'm not exactly sure which
          is a bit of a problem, but so far it's
          about a divorced woman, a writer, she's
          this high strung, over-amped,
          controlling, know it all neurotic. . .
              (everyone stares at her)
          Who's incredibly cute and lovable.
              (more stares)
          It's a comedy.
              (takes a seat next to Zoe)

                    M

          So, how did you two meet?

                     ARIN

          At a Wine Auction at Sotheby's. Harry was
          the big buyer of the night.

                    HARRY

          I kept winking at Marin as she was
          conducting the auction and apparently
          every time I did that she misunderstood
          and I ended up buying cases of
          outrageously expensive wine.




                                                        17.










Zoe and Marin laugh.

                    ERICA

          Ever been married, Harry?

                    HARRY

          No. No, I haven't.

                    ERICA

          Wow. Now why do you think that is?

                    HARRY

          Some people just don't fit the mold. And
          so far...

                    ERICA

          Hey, if it ain't broke.

                       HARRY

          Exactly.
Harry leans back, places his arm around Marin's chair. Erica
takes note.

                    ZOE

          Wait a second, aren't you like a famous
          bachelor?

                    HARRY

          I wouldn't say I'm famous.

                    ZOE

          No, I think I read a piece on you
          in New York Magazine.

                    HARRY

          I guess people find it interesting
          that I've escaped the noose for so
          long.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, wasn't the name of the article,
          "The Escape Artist"?

                    ERICA

          Wait. I read that article. That was you?
          You were once engaged to somebody big.
          Who was it? Not Joan Collins.. .Wait.
          ..Carly Simon?

                    ZOE

          Yeah, it was somebody cool like that.
              (trying to remember)
          Not Martha Stewart....




                                                18.











                    MARIN

          You could just ..'ask him.

                    HARRY

          No, this is more fun. It's like I'm
          not here.

                    MARIN

          Harry was once engaged to Diane
          Sawyer. Okay?

                    ZOE

          Right. Diane Sawyer. I love her.

                    ERICA

              (stunned)
          I'm impressed.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, women your age love that
          about me.
Erica pauses on that one.

                    HARRY

              (trying to get thru this)
          You know what I mean.

                      ERICA

          Yes I do.

                     HARRY

          It's not a bad thing to say 'women
          your age'.

                    ERICA

          No...I'm sure it was a compliment.

                    HARRY

          It was. ..just the truth.

                    ZOE

              (stepping in)
          So when was this engagement?

                    HARRY

          Long time ago. She was just this
          adorable lanky girl from Kentucky
          with the greatest pair of legs I'd
          ever seen... Never understood her
          ending up with a job where she
          never showed them.
              (munches on his lobster)




                                      19.











          ERICA

You're not serious? She's Diane
Sawyer, she goes into caves in
Afghanistan with a shmahtah on her
head. Who cares about her legs?

          HARRY

Just anyone who's ever had the
pleasure of... You know what? I
hate to eat and run but...

          ZOE

No, wait. This is actually a very
fascinating dynamic - what's going
on at this table...

          MARIN

    (warning him)

Z

 oe teaches Women's Studies at
Columbia. . .

          HARRY

Oh, so this is gonna hurt.

          ZOE

No, come on, listen, here's the rub
for women. Look at what we have
here with you and Erica. Harry,
you've been around the block a few
times, right? You're what? Around
60, never been married, which, we
all know, if you were a woman,
would be a curse, you'd be an old
maid, a spinster, blah, blah,
blah... Okay, so instead of pitying
you, they write articles about you,
celebrate your never marrying, it
makes you illusive and ungettable.
You're a real catch. Then, take my
gorgeous sister here...

          ERICA

Any chance of you stopping here?

          ZOE

Come on, this is interesting. I
mean, look at her, she's so
accomplished, the most successful
woman playwright since who? Lillian
Hellman? She's over fifty,
divorced and still sits in night
after night because the available
guys her age want
    (to Marin)




                                                        20.

                     ZOE(cont'd)
           --forgive me honey for saying this,
           but they want girls that look like
           Marin so the whole over fifty
           dating scene is geared completely
           towards men leaving older women out
           and as a result that makes the
           older women more and more
           productive and more and more
           interesting, which, in turn, makes
           them even less desirable because as
           we all know -- men, especially
           older men, are threatened and
           deathly afraid of interesting and
           accomplished women. It's just so
           clear. Single older women, as a
           demographic, are as fucked a group
           as can ever exist.
Erica and Harry's EYES CONNECT for a millisecond. HEAR THE

SOUND OF PLATES CRASHING.








INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

OVER, we
Erica is cleaning up the broken plates, Zoe leans down to
help.

                     ERICA

           What are you, possessed? How could
           you say those things?

                     ZOE

           It just seemed so obvious to me. The
           injustice of it. Thank God men die
           younger than us. It's the only break we
           get.

                     ERICA

           Then you know what? Write a dissertation
           on it, don't announce to the world that I
           stay in night after night after night and
           by the way, one night after night would
           have been enough. Did you ever realize, I
           stay "in" as part of my job. Why do you
           think I married the director of my plays?
           He was the only man I ever saw. Anyway, I
           like staying in and I like this time in
           my life. Why do I have to defend myself?
M          I was married for 20 years. I'm done.
 arin ENTERS carrying more dishes.

                     MARIN

           What the hell was that?




                                            21.











           ZOE

I'm sorry, I thought I was onto
something.

          ERICA

Honey, what are you doing with this
guy? He's old, he's chauvinistic...

            MARIN

He's fun.

          ERICA

He's fun? How is he fun? He's
like.. .wrong.

          MARIN

Wrong can be fun, Mom.

          ERICA

Not this wrong.

          MARIN

Can we not do this now? He's
actually incredibly smart and
fascinating and if you had talked
to him about something other than
his marital status you would've
found out how smart he is. He owns
like 10 different companies...

          ERICA

What does that mean he owns ten
different companies? He can't
commit, that's what that means. Not
that, God forbid, I want him to
commit.

          MARIN

Yeah, that I get. Anyway, he said he
thought you two were very spontaneous and
nice and then said he's leaving as soon
as the sun comes up.

          ERICA

What? His car doesn't have
headlights?

          MARIN

Good night.

           ERICA

Wait. I have no right to get this
nuts.
     (hugs her)
He's your friend. Not mine. I love
you.




                                                         22.











                    MARIN

              (hugs her back)
          I love you more.
This is obviously a ritual between them. Erica kisses
Marin's cheek in a flutter of kisses, then Marin

EXITS.

          No chance he said we were nice.

                    ERICA

          Please. None.
They HEAR MUSIC coming from Marin's bedroom.

                    ZOE

          What are they listening to?

                    ERICA

          I don't care...
              (listens)
          Oy. Marvin Gaye. . .
Erica turns on the garbage disposal. Zoe sings along,
"Let's get it on". .., Erica shoots her a look, turns
off the garbage disposal, doing the dishes with vigor.

                    ERICA

          I know she'll never see him after
          this weekend. She can't commit
          either.
Then they hear Marin GIGGLING.

                    ZOE

          He does sound fun.
Marin YELPS.

                    ZOE

          Admit it, he's got something. You
          felt it, right?
Then they hear Marin SCREAM.

                    ERICA

          Oh, this is nuts...
Erica covers her ears with her hands. Then they hear
Marin SCREAM "MOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!"

                    ERICA

          Did she say, Mom?




                                                        23.














INT. MARIN'S ROOM - ANGLE - THE DOOR

Erica and Zoe bust into the room and find Harry .on the
floor, leaning against the bed, a clenched fist on his chest.
His shirt is open, he's sweating, his complexion is grey.
Marin stands back, freaked out, afraid to get near him.

                      MARIN

           We were fooling around and he said he
           felt funny Hthen he just collapsed.

                      ARRY

               (out of breath)
           It's nothing. I'm okay maybe it was
           the lobster...

                     ERICA

           Does your chest hurt?

                     HARRY

           Like an elephant's standing on it.

                     ERICA

               (to Marin)
           Call 911...tell them to send an
           ambulance. . .
Marin hesitates.

                     ERICA

           Marin! Now!







HARRY'S POV - THE ROOM

Spinning. When he shuts his eyes, it goes BLACK. Spinning.
BLACK. Spinning. BLACK. He sees Marin, soft in the
background, on the phone and Erica coming toward him. He
hears Zoe:

                     ZOE(O.S.)

           What are you doing?

                     ERICA

               (coming closer)
           Mouth to mouth...

ON HARRY

Even in this state he gets that Erica is about to place her.
mouth on his. His eyes WIDEN IN HORROR, he reels back. Erica
catches this.

                     ERICA

           You fucking guy...




                                                        24.










She does it anyway. Her-mouth on his, her breath into his
lungs, over and over. Harry's eyes roll back in hi-so head.
As. Erica pounds on his chest, we HEAR THE BLARE OF A

SIREN...








AND A LOUD CLANG

As the DOORS to SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL FLY OPEN. Paramedics
WHEEL Harry through the corridors and into the ER with
dizzying speed. Two Nurses jostle Harry OFF the gurney and

ONTO A BED.

DR. JULIAN MERCER arrives at Harry's side. Julian is in his
early-thirties and has finally just graduated out of the 'you
look too young to be a doctor' syndrome. Julian is a man
whose goodness makes him sexy. He wears his hair shaggier
than you'd expect but then again, this is a Johns Hopkins
graduate who chose to live near the beach and work nights.
The Nurses place oxygen in Harry's nose, .;hook him up to a
heart monitor and connect him to an IV.

                    JULIAN

          How we doing here?

                    PARAMEDIC #1

          He's had 30 minutes of chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's 170 over 100, pulse 104,
          respirations 18...

                     JULIAN

          Let's get an EKG. Mr. Langer, I'm
          Dr. Mercer. Are you in any pain
          right now?
The Nurse wheels over an EKG machine, Julian helps hook it
up.

                    HARRY

          Feel some pressure in my
          chest...it's real tight.

                    JULIAN

          Can you show me where the pain is?
Harry clenches his fist over his sternum.

                    JULIAN

          What were you doing at the onset of
          the pain?

                    HARRY

          I was uh, kissing a beautiful...




                                                        25.











                    JULIAN

              (watching the monitor)
          Where you having intercourse?

                    HARRY

          -- Unfortunately, no.

                    JULIAN


          S

           ense of humor in tact...
              (checks EKG)
          Hang a nitroglycerine drip. Mr.
          Langer the EKG shows you have a
          blocked artery which is not
          allowing enough oxygen to get to
          the heart muscle.. .

                    HARRY

          I'm having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

          We're gonna stop it. But I need to
          know what kind of medications you
          take?

                    HARRY

              (scared shitless)
          I take uh... uh. . . Lipitor. . .

                    JULIAN

              (reading the EKG tape)
          Uh-huh... .Any thing else?

                    HARRY

          -- and a white one for blood
          pressure. . .

                       JULIAN

          procardia?

                       HARRY

          Yeah.

                    JULIAN

          What about, Viagra?
Erica, Marin and Zoe ARRIVE in the DOORWAY of the ER. Harry
eyes them...stalls.

                    JULIAN

          Mr. Langer? Did you take any Viagra
          today? Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          No. No Viagra.




                                                        26.











                    JULIAN

          You're positive?

                    HARRY

          I don't take Viagra. Don't need
          Viagra.
The Women grab looks at each other, know they shouldn't be
there. They turn away.

                    JULIAN

          Great. Just needed to be sure
          because I put nitroglycerin into
          your-drip and if you had taken
          Viagra, the combo would make your
          heart leap right out of your
          body...







CLOSE - HARRY'S EYES - PANICKED

As he watches the NITROGLYCERIN make it's way DOWN THE TUBE
and APPROACH HIS ARM. Just as the amber liquid is about to
enter his bloodstream he YANKS the IV out of his arm. The
drip is knocked onto the ground. The Women shriek as the
Nurses scurry to clean up. Erica and Zoe rush out, Marin
hangs back. Harry catches the look on her face.

                    JULIAN

          Let's give him an aspirin and
          Metoprolol 5mg...

                    HARRY

          Sorry, had an audience...
              (clutching his chest)

                    JULIAN

          It's okay. ..it was a great save.
              (to Nurse)
          Let's start the thrombolytic protocol.
          "4000 units of heparin. Mr. Langer, if
          this works and I have every reason to
          believe it will, it's going to reverse
          what's going on so there will be little
          or no damage to your heart. You with me?
              (Harry nods. Julian places
               his hand on Harry's)
          Okay, here we go.

THE HALLWAY

Marin paces, smoking. Erica sits. Zoe leans against the wall.

                    MARIN

          Oh, man, what if he doesn't make
          it? I don't know who to contact.




                                                           27.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I don't know his family. I've gone
          out to dinner with the guy three
          times. I hardly know him.

                    ERICA

          He's gonna make it. Don't worry.

                    M

          He's like a bulldog. He'll make it.

                     ARIN

          This is a nightmare. I go out with
          a guy who's so old, he takes
          Viagra.

                    ERICA

          Are you nuts? You go out with a guy
          who's so old he's having a heart
          attack!

                    ZOE

          All I can say is, thank God it didn't
          happen when he was inside you. That could
          be life altering.
Julian rounds the corner of the corridor. Marin rushes toward
him, her face begging for good news.

                    JULIAN

          Your Dad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

          Oh, he's not my Dad...

                     JULIAN

          I'm sorry.
              (then)
          Your Grandad's gonna be okay.

                    MARIN

              (throws her arms around
               him)
          Oh, thank you so much. But he's not my...
          oh we're not related. He's just a friend.

                    JULIAN

          Sorry.
His sweet apologetic smile is not lost on Marin. Zoe and
Erica join them.

                    JULIAN

          I'm Dr. Mercer. Mr. Langer did have a
          mild heart attack. I gave him something
          to break up the clot in his artery and it
          worked beautifully.




                                                        28.











                    JULIAN (CONT'D)

          His EKG returned to normal almost
          immediately which means I don't expect
          any permanent damage. He's very lucky.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Thank you. . .

                    JULIAN

          No, whoever got him here so fast should
          be thanked. Another half hour and I don't
          know if this would've worked.
Marin pats her Mom on the back.

                     ERICA

          Oh, man...
              (realizing it all now)
          This was...intense.
Erica wipes away a tear. Nothing could surprise her more.

                    JULIAN

          We're out of the woods. I've given him
          something to sleep, it might make him a
          little loopy at first but then it should
          knock him out.
              (to Erica)
          You're Mrs. Langer?

                    ERICA

          No, no I'm just... No. I'm Erica Barry. .
          He was having dinner at our house. I just
          met him this afternoon.

                    JULIAN

          You're Erica Barry?

                    ERICA

          Yes.

                    JULIAN

          The playwright?

                    ERICA

          Yes...

                    JULIAN

          What a pleasure. I'm a huge fan.
          Huge fan.

                    ERICA

          Really? Oh, thanks... This is my
          daughter, Marin, my sister, Zoe...




                                                        29.










Julian says Hi to each then returns his attention fully and
devotedly to Erica. Takes her in.

                    JULIAN

          Wow.







CLOSE - A JAPANESE TEA POT

Julian pours steaming hot tea into 3 paper cups.







MARIN - CLOSE

Sitting in the hospital corridor as JULIAN'S HAND ENTERS HER
FRAME and hands her a cup of tea. She looks up at him with
more adorableness than most men could handle. She blows on

                     M

the steam.

                     ARIN

          Thanks.
Camera Pans to ZOE. Sitting next to Marin. She is also handed
a Cup of Tea. Even she softens as she looks up at Julian.

                    ZOE

          Thank you Doctor.
This is all beginning to feel a little like the Step Sisters
trying on the Glass Slipper. Until we get to Erica, not
paying any attention at all as she is handed her Tea.

                    ERICA

          Oh. . .Hey. . .Ew. . .Hot. Thanks.

                    JULIAN

              (eyes on Erica)
          You're welcome. May I join you?

                    ERICA

          Yeah. Sure. This is very nice of
          you.

                    JULIAN

          First year of medical school you
          learn what can keep you up all
          night without making you nuts.
          Green Tea beats everything plus
          it's a great antioxidant. Cheers.

                    MARIN

              (turning on the charm)
          So, urn, do you always work nights?




                                                  30.











                    JULIAN

          Usually two or-three a week, gives
          me a chance for a real life during
          the day. . .
              (immediately turns back to
               Erica)
          You know, I heard you had a place
          in the Hamptons. I really am a very
          big fan. I honestly think I've seen
          every play you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          I think some were written before
          your time. There are some Marin's
          never even seen.

                    JULIAN

          No, I'm pretty sure I've seen them
          all and I saw the last one twice.
Zoe nudges Erica as a Nurse enters from the ER.

                    NURSE

          Doctor, we've got a walk in, may
          need stitches. . .

                    JULIAN

              (rises)
          I'll check on MI. Langer...if he's
          asleep; you all might want to get
          some shut eye and come back in the
          morning. Great to meet you Erica.
          Ladies. . .
The Women wave and watch him exit.
The second he's gone:

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Okay, now that's a perfect a guy
          for you. He's adorable.

                    MARIN

          Mother! I've never seen a man less
          interested in me.

                    ZOE

          Or more interested in you.

                    ERICA

          Me? He's thirty years old.

                    MARIN

          No, he's older than that.




                                                        31.











                    ZOE

          Who cares how old, he is. I mean,
          he's not my type, he's like a
          gorgeous wholesome doctor but, he's
          perfect for you and hot for you,
          which makes him really perfect.

                    ERICA

          Stop it. He likes my work. Not me.
              (they just stare at her)
          It's insane. I would never.
              (off Zoe's look)
          Shut. Up.
Just then, Harry stumbles into the corridor in his Hospital

                     Z

Gown, pretty out of it.

                     OE

          Yuh-oh.

                    MARIN

              (rises)
          Harry....
Confused, Harry turns around, a little lost, giving the Women
a FULL VIEW OF HIS BARE ASS. The Women muffle screams.

                    MARIN

          Harry! Over here!
He faces them.

                    HARRY

          Honey, I want to go home. Can you
          call Lowell to pick me up?

                    MARIN

              (confused)
          Lowell?
Harry wobbles. Is he going to fall? Marin freezes, looks to
her Mom for help. Erica rushes to Harry.

                    ERICA

          Harry, you have to get back in bed.

                    HARRY

          Woman. And I say that as a
          compliment... You saved my life.
              (kisses her hand)
          Soft.. .
              ( then)
          I don't remember your name but I
          thank you from the bottom of my...




                                                        32.










He falls on Erica, totally out of it, his head on her breast,
his mouth open.

                    ERICA

              (afraid to breathe)
          Ugh. Look at this, even
          unconscious, he's a lech.
The Nurses rush out and peel Harry off Erica.

                    NURSE

          Mr. Langer, you shouldn't be
          standing.

                    HARRY

          Got to take a whiz girls.

                    NURSE

          We'll take care of that for you,
          Mr. Langer.
Harry turns back to the Women, smiling. He likes that idea.
LOVES that idea.

                    HARRY

          Okay. You take care of it for me,
          sweetheart. I'd like to see that...
As he walks away, his bare ass shines like a full moon in a
desert sky.

                    MARIN

          This is the most insane night of my
          life.

                    ZOE

          Yeah, but just admit that was one
          great ass for a guy that age.







CLOSE - A LARGE VASE OF YELLOW ROSES - 36 HOURS LATER

A Nurse slides the Roses down the counter of her station.

                    NURSE

          Now what can I do you for?
She looks across at a neat as a pin Man in his early forties,
Prada suit, crisp white shirt, dark tie. He's a Gershwin tune
of a man. A throwback to a kinder world. This is. LOWELL,
Harry's Houseman/Chef/all around Man Friday.

                    LOWELL

          I'm here for Mr. Harry Langer.
Julian ENTERS the Nurse's station.




                                                        33.











                    NURSE

              (to Julian)
          Are we discharging Hurricane Harry?

                    JULIAN

          Yes we are. Hi, I'm Dr. Mercer.
          Come on, I'll take you to him.
Julian EXITS the Nurse's Station. Lowell, carrying the
flowers, follows. He nods to TWO TALL LEGGY MINI SKIRTED
ASSISTANT TYPES, KIM and LEXI who follow. Both pack cell

                     J

phones, note pads, carry balloons, flowers and shopping bags.

                     ULIAN

          And you are. . ?

                    LOWELL

          Lowell St. James'. Mr. Langer's
          houseman, chef... general valet..

                    JULIAN

          Well that sounds like a pretty,
          interesting job.

                    LOWELL

          Fifteen years. Never a dull moment.
They arrive at:







A PRIVATE ROOM

where Harry lies on the bed, dressed and ready to go. He
squints as he reads a pamphlet at arms's distance called,
"Heart Attack -- Bouncing Back".

                    JULIAN

          Okay, Harry, looks like we're going
          to have to let you go.
Harry sits up too fast, lies right back down. Lowell looks
like he might cry. The Girls hold back.

                    HARRY

          Take it easy kids, I just sat up
          too fast. Doc, tell them. Am I in
          good shape? How were my tests this
          morning?

                    JULIAN

          He's doing extremely well.

                    LOWELL

              (holding back tears)
          Can I hug him?




                                                           34.











                    JULIAN

          Absolutely.
Harry stands and indulges Lowell in a deep hug. Lowell's
shoulders shake as he sobs.

                    HARRY

          Okay, Okay. Let's not get goofy. We
          got no thin , but good news here.

                    LOWELL

          I must say, you do look good...
          considering. You have a little
          extra baggage under your eyes, but
          I know how to fix that.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          See what good hands I'm in. Did you
          meet my gorgeous assistants?

                    JULIAN

          Not formally.

                     HARRY

          Girls... .my Doctor, Julian Mercer.
              (then)
          Honey, did you bring the CDs?
Kim hands Harry a shopping bag full of CDs.

                    HARRY

              (to Julian)
          These are for you...
              (to the Girls)
          The man loves Hip Hop.

                    JULIAN

              (checking out the bag)
          Maybe not this much but...

                    HARRY

          And did you bring the other thing?
Lexi hands Harry another bag. Harry reaches in and pulls out
a small leather box, hands it to Julian.

                    HARRY

          This is just to thank you for your
          brilliance the other night. I hope
          it suits you.

                    JULIAN

              (opening the box)
          Wow. This is.. .Jesus, this is the
          most gorgeous watch I've ever seen.




                                                        35.











                    HARRY

          - Oh, good. It's a Piaget.
              (to Girls)
          He likes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, I love it and this is incredibly
          generous of you but I can't accept it.

                    HARRY

          You save my life and you end up
          with some CDs?

                    JULIAN

          No, I end up seeing you walk out of
          here and I do get paid you know -

                    MARIN (O.S.)

          -- Knock, knock.

T

 hey all turn, see Marin at the door. She waves to Harry,
more reserved than normal.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'll see you on the way out.

                    LOWELL

              (whispers)
          We'll pull up the car.
Everyone EXITS leaving Marin and Harry alone. Harry sits on
the bed. Marin joins him. Harry places his hand on her thigh.
All she notices is his hospital bracelet.

                    HARRY

          So, I'm some great date, huh?

                    MARIN

          Yeah... Mr. Excitement.

                    HARRY

          Tell me somethin', we haven't actually
          had sex yet, have we?

                    MARIN

          No we haven't. You're correct on
          that one.

                    HARRY

          Something to live for.
Marin smiles, kisses Harry on the cheek.




                                                        36.











                    HARRY

          Down to the cheek.
              (that's big, he digests
               that one)
          Come on, let's get outta here.







EXT. SOUTHAMPTON HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled out in a wheelchair, Marin and a Nurse on
either side. In the parking lot is a Town Car with Lowell and
the Girls standing next to it. Next to them is Erica, waiting
by her car. She's on her cell phone. Harry spots them and
tries to get out of the wheel chair before it stops.

                    NURSE

          Hold on Tarzan, we're still movin' ...
              (she stops)
          Okay, now slow-ly.
To prove her wrong, Harry rises quickly. Everyone stands by,
ready to help.

                    HARRY

          Look at these faces. Will you tell them
          I'm fine.
As soon as Harry spots Erica, he starts to wobble.

                    ERICA

          Whoa! Whoa! WHOA!
Everyone grabs for Harry as he FALLS OUT OF FRAME AND THE

SCREEN GOES BLACK.








CLOSE ON JULIAN

taking Harry's pulse as Harry lies on the ASPHALT OF THE
HOSPITAL PARKING LOT. Lowell, the Two Assistants and Marin
huddle around. Erica steps back a bit.

                    JULIAN

          Harry, I'm sorry, but I think we jumped the
          gun.. .can't let you travel quite yet.

                    HARRY

          I ain't goin' back in there.

                    JULIAN

          You don't have to but I can't put you in
          a car right now and I can't leave you in
          the parking lot. I'd like you to stay
          nearby for a few days and let me keep an
          eye on you 'til you get your strength
          back.




                                                        37.











                    HARRY

          Doc, I'm out in the middle of the
          Hamptons. Where do you want me to go?
Marin turns to Erica who very clearly mouths, "FORGET IT!"







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER THAT DAY.

The Town Car sits in the driveway, Lexi leans on the hood,
talking on her cell. A Market Delivery Van pulls away as a
Drugstore Delivery Van pulls in. A Flower Delivery KID
holding a large bouquet, knocks at the front door.

I





 NT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed wearing silk pajamas, holding an unlit
cigar, and is on the phone.
Zoe enters, placing the new bouquet on the already flower
filled dresser. Lowell lifts a LUNCH TRAY off the bed as Kim
stands nearby on the cell phone. Marin packs her bag.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Just promise me you won't make a decision until
          we talk. Thinking about it ain't promising me.
          Okay, man, I'm seein' you Friday...
              (hangs up, then to Lowell)
          Lowell, what was that?

                    LOWELL

              (looking down at the Tray)
          Your lunch.

                    HARRY

          Somebody tell you to starve me to death?
Kim hands Harry the cell phone.

                     KIM

          Russell.

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Rush? No, man, you're livin' the shit.
          I just got a clean bill of health.
Kim hands Harry a NOTE that says:







          YOU HAVE TWO DINNER DATES THIS WEEK,


          SHOULD I CANCEL AND SEND FLOWERS?





                                                        38.










Harry steals a look at Marin, then nods to Kim.







INT. KITCHEN

Erica puts away groceries, a little on edge. Her back is to a
Man in his fifties, who sits at the island, eating a
sandwich. He wears sweats and a baseball cap. His natural
expression is -- worried. This is DAVE.

                    DAVE

          This is the best turkey sandwich I
          ever had in my life. What kind of
          mustard is this?

                    ERICA

              (not turning around)
          I don't know.

                    DAVE

          All right, don't get pissy. It's
          not Dijon, right?

                    ERICA

          Don't get pissy. ..you say that 'cause
          this, of course, would never happen to
          you. .1 come out here for peace and quiet
          and suddenly I'm a character in a Kaufman
          and Hart play.
              (the phone RINGS)
          And the phone does not stop.
              (phone STOPS RINGING)
          And it's never for me!
Lowell ENTERS with the Bed Tray.

                    LOWELL

          Sorry to interrupt.

                    ERICA

          That's fine Lowell, I'll take that.

                    LOWELL

          No, please, allow me.

                    ERICA

          No, no, I'll take it. No problem.
Erica takes the bed tray as Lowell EXITS.

                    ERICA

          The man does not know my name and
          I'm doing his dishes.
Lexi ENTERS, all 5'10" of her. Dave suddenly looks alive. She
carries an empty water glass.




                                                          39.











                    LEX

          Hi Erica. Um...where should I put

                    E

          this?

                     RICA

          Right here. I'll take it.

                    LEXI

          And Harry has a headache. Do you
          have any Tylenol?

                    ERICA

          Tylenol yes. ..
              (reaches in cabinet)

                     LEXI

              (extends her hand to Dave)
          Hi. I'm Lexi, Harry's second
          assistant.

                    DAVE

          Hey...Dave Klein. How ya doin'?
Erica hands Lexi the Tylenol, she thanks her and EXITS.

                    ERICA

              (holding the water glass)
          Where should I put this? It's an
          empty water glass. What are the
          choices?

                    DAVE

              (rises)
          I'm gettin' outta your hair.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.

                    DAVE

          So you're not ready to show me any
          pages? I'm not putting pressure on
          you, I'm just asking.

                    ERICA

          I haven't written a word. I'm on
          page twelve and the first eleven
          pages stink.

                      DAVE

          So you have one good page.
               (then)
          How tall do you think that girl
          was?
Before Erica can respond, Marin ENTERS.




                                                        40.











                    MARIN

          Dad! I didn't know you were here.

                    DAVE

          I'm just on my way out, bubbee.

                    MARIN

          Well, I was just gonna drive into the
          city with Zoe but if you're driving back,
          I'd much rather go with you.

                    DAVE

          I have to meet someone before I go...

                    ERICA

              (to Marin)
          Wait wait wait wait. You're leaving, Zoe's
          leaving, the entourage is leaving. And I'm
          supposed to stay here with him alone?

                    MARIN

          The doctor said" he's 'sending over
          a Nurse in the morning...

                       ERICA

          The morning? That's nineteen hours from
          now...
                 (takes a deep breath)
          Okay, I can handle this. I'm just going
          to get into a zen' place, play music,
          cook, write, focus...

                    DAVE

          She never changes...

                    ERICA

              (setting him straight)
          Yes. Maybe that's a good thing.







EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - SUNSET

No cars are out front. Quiet and peaceful. On the Soundtrack
we hear the French tune, I wish You Love sung in French.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN - THE SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Erica cooks, softly singing along in French.

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          Smells great in here.
Surprised, Erica turns to find Harry leaning in the doorway
in his pajamas, robe and slippers. No one's ever had more
gorgeous clothes to sleep in. His presence disarms her.




                                                        41.











                    ERICA

          Coq au Vin...
              (he looks confused)

                    H

          Chicken cooked in red wine...

                     ARRY

          French Food... French music...

                    ERICA

          Part of my play takes place in Paris so
          I'm hoping this helps me think. I'm
          hopin'...How you feeling?

                    HARRY

          Well, I walked all the way in here,
          only bumping into two chairs and an
          ottoman.

                    ERICA

          Everyone bumps into that ottoman.
Harry appreciates the thought. Before it has time to become
awkward, the Phone RINGS.

                    HARRY

          Hey, thanks for letting me...

                    ERICA

          Yeah, no...it's fine.
              (answering the phone)
          Hello. Yes, he is.
              (hands the phone to Harry)

                    HARRY

              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey sweets...
              (Erica hates this)
          Oh, you got the flowers? Are they
          pretty?
Erica can't stand this. She puts on her glasses and skims her
recipe.

                    HARRY

          Hey, can I call you in a little
          bit. What's your number doll?
              (spots a pad and pencil)
Harry squints, can't see what he's writing...backs his head
away from the pad. Erica hands him her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (slips them on, jots down
               the number)
          Okay... Call you in a little.




                                                          42.










Harry hangs up and hands the glasses back to Erica.

                    HARRY

          Same prescription...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, it's not like in any stretch
          of the imagination, I think you're all
          that right for my daughter but I don't
          really appreciate hearing you on the
          phone with other women. It's like I'm an
          accomplice to you cheating, it's...

                    HARRY

          Your daughter knows I see other women.

                    ERICA

          She does? I mean, fine, it's none
          of my business...but...
              (struggles to open a
               bottle of wine)

                    HARRY

          She knows I'm not monogamous...We've
          discussed it.

                    ERICA

          Great? And that's what? Why are you
          proud of that?

                    HARRY

          Not proud. Just honest. Your daughter
          said she likes that about me.
              (takes the wine and opens
               it with ease.)

                    ERICA

          My daughter is confused when it comes to men.

                    HARRY

          I don't blame her. We're confusing.
Harry hands her the open wine bottle.







EXT. BEACH PATIO








WIDE SHOT - ALMOST NIGHT

Erica and Harry sit not so close together at a long table,
under a purple sky. Another French Tune plays. If this wasn't
them, this would look romantic.

N

 othing is said. Just two people eating. Harry lifts the salt
shaker, about to add salt to his chicken.




                                                        43.











                    ERICA

          Should I just call the ambulance now?
Harry shoots her a look and places the salt shaker back on the
table.







EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - OVER - LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S LA VIE EN ROSE

A starry sky gives the house a storybook setting. We HEAR THE

PHONE RING.








INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica works at a laptop at a cluttered table. The CLOCK tells us
it's a little after ONE A.M. Annoyed by the ringing phone, she
points her remote at the CD Player and stops' the song. Harry
answers the phone in his room. A moment of quiet. Erica points her
remote, starts the song again, starts typing again. Now the other
line RINGS. She looks over at the phone watching one RED LIGHT
"BLINK, while the other line is answered.

                    ERICA

          What am I doing?
She throws a piece of paper over the phone so she can't see it.
She clicks on her AOL ICON and is told: AOL CANNOT CONNECT. LINE
BUSY. She's pissed. Then, worse, she SMELLS something.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry is on the phone, smoking a cigar. His pajama top is
unbuttoned, his hair is allover the place. His bed is a mess,
laptop open, newspapers spilling onto the floor. Erica stands
in the doorway. He quickly hides his cigar.

                     HARRY

               (into phone)
          Can you hold a see, doll?
               (looks to Erica)
          Hey.

                     ERICA

          Okay, here's the thing. I really don't
          want to play the part of the uptight
          Nurse to your bad boy patient. If you
          want to have another heart attack, go
          ahead, it's your life but I have work to
          do and I don't have time to make another
          run to the hospital because you're
          filling your already clogged arteries
          with smoke but more importantly, I'd
          rather not have my house smell like a
          pool hall.




                                                        44.










Erica holds out a partially filled water glass for Harry to
deposit his cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I have a question for you.
She waits. She doesn't say anything.

                     ERICA

          What? Do I Hhave to say what?

                     ARRY

          Have you always been like this or
          do I bring this out in you?
She shakes the water glass, waiting for the deposit. He drops
the cigar in.

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've ever had this
          effect on a woman before.

                    ERICA

              (picking up the
               newspapers)
          And what effect do you think you're
          having on me?

                    HARRY

          I don't quite recognize it, that's how I
          know I've never had it before.
Erica rolls her eyes as she finishes cleaning up.

                    HARRY

          So you don't sleep?

                    ERICA

          I only need about four hours a night.

                    HARRY

          Me too. Never slept eight hours in my
          life.

                    ERICA

          Me either. I wish I could. ..but...
              (re: curtains)
          Want me to shut these, sun comes in
          pretty strong in the morning.

                    HARRY

          Sure. . . thanks. . .

                    ERICA

              (drawing the drapes)
          Who you talking to at this hour?




                                                        45.











                    HARRY

          A friend in L.A. It's only ten out there.

                    ERICA

          And that's not past her bedtime?

                    HARRY

          So you don't get more mellow as the hours
          pass?

                    ERICA

              (heading out)
          Good night, Harry.

                    HARRY

          Can I ask you one other thing?
              (Erica turns)
          What's with the turtlenecks? It's
          the middle of summer.

                    ERICA

          Now seriously, why do you care what I
          wear?

                    HARRY

          Just curious.

                    ERICA

          I like them. I've always liked them. I'm
          just a turtleneck kinda gal.

                    HARRY

          You ever get hot?

                    ERICA

          No.

                    HARRY

          Never?

                    ERICA

          Not lately.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Almost TWO. Erica is writing, her eyes go to the phone with
the typing paper over it. She LIFTS a corner of the paper,
takes a peek. The one lit line GOES OUT. Finally. "Erica
turns off her computer, sits for a second. No one has rattled
her cage like this in quite some time. And no, she doesn't
like it. She stands, starts to undress.

ANGLE - THE FLOOR





                                                        46.










As Erica's TURTLENECK lands on it. Then her BRA, then her
PANTS then her PANTIES.

ERICA - NAKED - TIGHT SHOT

She crosses through the room on her way to the Bathroom. She
passes by her partially open door, happens to look out INTO

THE HALLWAY AND SEES:


HARRY - PLANTED RIGHT IN FRONT OF HER

Seeing it all.

ERICA - SCREAMS

and DROPS OUT OF FRAME.

HARRY

flustered, spins around, loses his balance, crashes into the
wall, covers his eyes.

                    HARRY

          I'm sorry! Oh, God am I sorry.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          What are you doing?!?

                    HARRY

          Trying to find the kitchen!

                    ERICA (O.S.)

          Back here???

                    HARRY

          I-I got confused..! It was dark. I didn't
          really see anything. Just your tits and a
          little of your-
Erica SLAMS HER DOOR. Photos on the wall shake.

                    HARRY

          This is gonna be murder.







INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

A very wide MIDDLE AGED NURSE gruffly crosses thru the room
toward the Front Door. Just as she opens the door, Erica
ENTERS in hat, sunglasses, turtleneck, long skirt. Pretty
much no skin is showing whatsoever. She carries a few
packages.

                    NURSE

          Good bye Mrs. Barry.




                                                        47.











                    ERICA

          Good bye? You're leaving? That's
          not good.

                    NURSE

          Been fired.

                     ERICA

          Fired?   You just started.

                    HARRY

          Not fired darlin'. Just not needed.
Erica hardly looks at You Know Who who appears to be fresh
out of the shower, wet hair, silk robe, bare chest and legs.

                    ERICA

          What do you mean, not needed? Of
          course we need her. She's gonna
          take care of you and feed you and...

                    HARRY

          -- No, no, I'm actually feeling
          pretty perky today. Making quite a
          recovery. . .
              (opening the screen door)
          Sorry for the trouble Mrs.
          Gimble... Take care, dear.
Harry hands her a wad of bills like she's a Maitre'd. Mrs.
Gimble gives Erica a look of pity as she exits. Erica, now
alone with Harry, self-consciously adjusts her sunglasses.
Harry, on the other hand, slips his hand onto his bare chest,
pats it.

                    HARRY

          Listen, about last night.

                    ERICA

          Yeah. How 'bout we never talk about that?
              (hands him some pills)
          I was at the drugstore. Your
          prescriptions were ready. They said take
          these two with food and this one without.

                    HARRY

          Honestly, you were in silhouette.

                    ERICA

          I think that's talkin' about it.

                    HARRY

          I really didn't see all that much.




                                                        48.











                    ERICA

              (heading toward her room)
          Yip. There you go.

                    HARRY

          Okay. Won't mention it again but...

                    ERICA

              (almost out of the room)
          Goin' to work, Harry.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          You saw my ass, you don't see me
          acting nuts, wearing hats and
          glasses and weird get ups...
The Sound of a DOOR SLAM. - Harry flinches.







INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM

Harry and Julian sit on the bed. Julian takes Harry's blood
pressure.

                    HARRY

          Yes or no. What's the deal, can I
          go?

                    JULIAN

          You still getting dizzy?

                    HARRY

          Not as much.

                    JULIAN

          Out of breath?

                    HARRY

          Only sometimes.

                    JULIAN

              (listens with stethoscope)
          How's Erica treating you?

                       HARRY

          Who?

                     JULIAN

              (nods toward Living Room)
          Erica. . .

                    HARRY

          Her? Oh, she's a major piece of
          work. The woman wears turtlenecks
          in the middle of the summer.




                                                      49.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          She's beyond uptight. Almost makes
          her fun to be around.

                    JULIAN

          Uptight? That's funny. I haven't
          noticed that.

                    HARRY

          Try livin' with her.
Julian takes Harry's pulse.

                    HARRY

              (with secret glee)
          I actually saw her naked last
          night.

                    JULIAN

          That doesn't sound so uptight.

                    HARRY

          It was an accident. She thought I
          was asleep, I thought her room was
          the kitchen.

                    JULIAN

          You know what Freud said - there
          are no accidents.

                    HARRY

          Trust me. This was an accident. Although,
          why would she be walking around naked
          when she knows I'm 20 feet away.

                    JULIAN

          Why would you think her bedroom was
          the kitchen?

                    HARRY

          It was dark, it was two in the
          morning.

                    JULIAN

          That could explain why she was walking
          around naked. Deep breath...

                    HARRY

          You know I've never seen a woman
          that age naked before.

                    JULIAN

          You're kidding?

                    HARRY

          Hey, we're not all doctors.




                                                        50.











                    JULIAN

          Well, I think she's very beautiful
          and she's a fantastic writer, you
          know.

                    HARRY

          No, I don't know...

                    JULIAN

          Erica Barry? She's pretty major.
              (writing a prescription)
          So, you date her daughter?

                     HARRY

          Okay, now she's a great chick. Must take
          after the father. Which reminds me...Doc,
          what (about Mr. Midnight here. . ?
                indicates his dick)
          When can I be up and running in
          that department?

                    JULIAN

          I think Mr. Midnight needs to stay
          put for another couple of weeks.

                    HARRY

          But it won't kill me when I do it, right?

                    JULIAN

          It's exercise. It'll be good for you. And
          just so you know, I'm told after a heart
          attack, if you can climb a flight of
          stairs, you can have sex.

                                                  CUT TO:








A LOW ANGLE OF A STAIRCASE

Which goes from the beach up to Erica's deck. Harry stands at
the bottom of the stairs in his robe, velvet slippers and
sunglasses.' He looks up to the top of the stairs as if it's
Mt. Everest. Bravely, he climbs the first few steps. Not bad.
After two more, he's out of breath. Determined, he holds onto
the railing and drags himself up to the next step. Happy with
himself, he holds on for dear life and drags himself up one
more...and then, he's so out of breath, he can barely move,
yet he reaches up the railing and tries to hike himself up
one more.







INT . KITCHEN - SAME TIME

The tea kettle WHISTLES as Erica and Julian stand on either
side of her island. Erica reaches for a tea bag.




                                                        51.











                    ERICA

          So, you're saying, he's not ready
          to travel at all? Not even by
          plane? Train?

                    JULIAN

          I don't think so...
              (sees her disappointment)
          It's been tough, huh?

                    ERICA

          Well, he fired the Nurse after an
          hour, now says he doesn't need one.
          He's a bit of a workout.. .yeah.

                    JULIAN

          How are you holding up?

                    ERICA

          Oh, fine. .I'm fine, I'm...

                    JULIAN

          One more fine and I won't believe you.
The Phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Oh, shoot, hold on...
              (into phone)
          Hello. Hey...Oh, hi...







ANGLE - JULIAN

Smitten. Just something about her. Watching her.







ANGLE - ERICA

Not noticing, pouring water for her tea.

                    ERICA

              (into phone)
          No, I'm finally getting to it...
Erica sees Julian sliding a slip of paper over to her. Looks
over at it. It's a piece of paper from his prescription pad.
On it is written...Have dinner with me tonight? Erica looks
up at him. Stunned. J

                     ULIAN

              (heading out)
          Pick you up around seven?

                    ERICA

          W-What about the patient?




                                                          52.











                    JULIAN

          Like he said, he doesn't need a
          nurse.
We begin to hear strains of another French song.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON - MUSIC OVER

Erica at her desk, typing. The Music plays from the CD
player. As much as she doesn't want it to be true, this
attention from Julian has fueled her.







THE LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - MUSIC OVER

Harry, dressed for the first time, wearing khaki's and a
summer shirt, strolls through the Living Room a bit cautious.

                    HARRY

              (yells, warning-like)
          I'm Walking Around The house!
ERICA Laughs. Even she knows this is funny. Harry arrives at
her open doorway, timidly pokes his head in.

                    ERICA

          Listen, I've decided to get over the
          whole "you saw me naked" thing. So, we
          don't have to deal with it anymore. Okay?

                    HARRY

          Good, 'cause I've been hiding from
          you all day.

                    ERICA

          I know. You want to come in?

                    HARRY

          I don't want to break your rhythm
          or anything.

                    ERICA

          That would be wishful thinking.
Harry ENTERS cautiously and curiously.

                    HARRY

          Beautiful painting. So I'm gonna
          venture out there and go for a
          short walk...

                    ERICA

          You up to that?




                                                        53.











                    HARRY

          My doctor recommended it. I gotta
          build up to stairs and stuff like
          that. You wouldn't want to join me?

                    ERICA

          That means you don't want me to?

                    HARRY

          No, I was asking if you wanted to.

                    ERICA

          Oh, well, I would but...I don't
          usually like to break once I've
          started writing so I probably
          shouldn't, not that a little fresh
          air would hurt but...

                    HARRY

          It's just a walk Erica, not a
          marriage proposal.

                    ERICA

          You know my name.

                    HARRY

          Erica Jane Barry. I looked you up
          on the internet.







EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER - LATE .IN THE DAY

Erica and Harry walk by the water's edge. They are the only
two people on the beach.

                    HARRY

          -- Did you know there are over eight
          thousand websites that mention you?

                    ERICA

          That can't be possible.

                    HARRY

          No, it's true. I know everything
          about you now. And not because of
          last night, but...

                    E


                     RICA

          Yeah, I understood. I actually
          looked you up too. You grew up in
          L.A., which I thought nobody did.




                                                         54.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          You were the road manager for a group I
          sorta never heard of, started your own
          record label at 29, sold it at 45, then
          started buying and selling boutique
          companies then invested in a small record
          company which you turned into the 2nd
          largest Hip Hop label in the world.

                    HARRY

          It's exhausting just hearing about it.

                    ERICA

          I know, but the truth is, it goes
          fast doesn't it?

                    HARRY

          Like the blink of an eye.
Erica bends down and picks up A FLAT WHITE STONE, then
another and another...

                    HARRY

          I noticed you have bowls of those
          all over your house.

                    ERICA

          I know, I'm crazy, I just think
          they're so beautiful...

                    HARRY

          But why do you only pick up the white
          ones?

                    ERICA

          I don't only pick up the white ones.

                    HARRY

          Oh, so you really are crazy.

                    ERICA

          I pick up only the white ones?
              (looks in her hand)
          Oh, God, what does that mean? I'm
          controlling, unadventurous, what?

                    HARRY

          So you're as hard on yourself as
          you are on everyone else.
Erica is stunned that he caught on to that. Harry bends down,
picks up a BROWN stone, places it in her palm among the white
stones.

                    HARRY

          Something to remember me by.




                                                        55.










Erica realizes she can't sum this guy up so easily or at all.

                    ERICA

          So can I ask you something Harry? What's
          with all the young girls? I mean, what's
          the story there, really?

                    HARRY

          I just like to travel light.

                    ERICA

          You just like to travel light? Oh,
          please, what the hell does that mean?

                    HARRY

          Now see a thirty year old gets that.

                    ERICA

          You mean falls for that.

                    HARRY

          I mean, accepts it.

                    ERICA

          If that's what you want... a non
          threatening woman, who won't get your
          number, you get to run the show...

                    HARRY

          I think our relationship is growing
          by the way. Have you noticed?
There he goes again. She can't believe he's cute like this.

                    HARRY

          I'm serious. Maybe we just needed to get
          out of the house. Now, you may notice,
          interestingly, we're walking back toward
          the house and its getting a little rocky
          again.

                    ERICA

          Of course it's getting a little
          rocky, we're talking about you.

                    HARRY

          See, I'll accept that slight
          hostility because I'm enjoying your
          company so much.

T

 hey're reached the bottom of the beach stairs. Harry looks
up, daunted.

                      ERICA

          You okay?




                                                           56.











                    HARRY

          Yeah, but I think I'11 stay down here and
          watch the sunset. You interested?
Erica checks her watch.

                    HARRY

          Big dinner date?

                    ERICA

          Well, yeah, as a matter of fact.
          With your doctor.

                    HARRY

          Ohhhhh, my doctor, 'cause he's not
          too young for you, huh?

                    ERICA

          No, he's totally too young for me.
          But we're just having dinner. It's
          not a date.

                    HARRY

          Does he know that?

                    ERICA

          Well, I'll tell him, but I doubt
          that he thinks of it that way.

                    HARRY

          I doubt that you doubt that. Anyway, you
          may like it. Think of it this way -- he's
          not threatening, won't get your number,
          you get to run the show. You might have a
          hell of a time.
Over, we HEAR, DING DONG.







THAT NIGHT - THE FRONT DOOR - SWINGS OPEN

And we find Julian. Looking just as any girl would hope.
Dream Date.

AND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DOOR

is Harry, in his robe and PJ's.

                    JULIAN

          Hey, look who's answering the door.

                    HARRY

          And look who's at the door.

                    JULIAN

          Brought you something.




                                                        57.










Julian hands him a take-out food box.

                     JULIAN

          A heart healthy dinner from our
          cafeteria.

                       ERICA (O.S.)

          Hello...
Both guys turn at once. She looks beautiful, wearing a dress,
probably the sexiest one she owns. No turtleneck tonight.
Julian walks to her, kisses her on the cheek.

                    JULIAN

          You look beautiful.

                       ERICA

          Thank you.
Behind Julian's back Harry gives Erica the 'OK' sign.

                    ERICA

              (thrown)
          We ready..?

                    JULIAN

          Let me just see how Harry's doing.
          It'll take two seconds. Har, have a
          seat. .







ANGLE - HARRY

sitting, self-conscious in his new role - The Sick One.
Julian takes his wrist, feels his pulse. Harry looks straight
ahead.







WHAT HE SEES - ERICA'S LEGS

as she sits right in front of him. She crosses her legs and
her dress hikes up a little, exposing her thigh.
JULIAN furrows his brow.

                    HARRY

          What? That's not the face you want
          to see your doctor making.

                     JULIAN

          Your pulse is a little fast but
          maybe you're just excited about
          something.
Harry LOOKS AT ERICA'S LEGS again.




                                                         58.











                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          I don't think so. I'm not excited
          about anything.
Erica shifts, the hem of her skirt RISING even higher.

                    JULIAN

          There it goes again. Racing.

                    HARRY

          Doc... Impossible!
Erica rises, leaving Harry's eye-line.

                    JULIAN

          Oh, there we go, now I feel better.
          Back to normal.
Harry winces then rises, looks to Erica as she throws a
pashmina over her shoulders in SLOW MOTION. Harry rushes them

OUT THE DOOR.


                    HARRY

          Okay, all right, good, have fun, don't
          rush back for me and don't do anything I
          wouldn't do.

                    ERICA

          Well that wouldn't leave us too
          many options would it?

                    HARRY

          And do we wonder how she writes
          that snappy repartee.
              (whispers to Erica)
          Let him pick up the check. It'll
          make him feel older.
On Erica's shocked expression, the DOOR SLAMS.







INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT - A BEN WEBSTER CD PLAYS

Harry lies on the sofa. CAMERA MOVES UP Harry's body, past
the hospital take out carton on his stomach and finally up to

                     M

his face. As the CAMERA moves we HEAR:

                     ARIN (O.S.)

          Hi, it's Marin, I'm not in so leave
          a message and I'll call you back.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's me...just sitting around
          looking at your baby pictures...
          Thinking about you...




                                                          59.










He hangs up, dials another number.

                    ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)

          Hi and HI, you've reached Brooke and
          Shannon. For Brooke push one, for -
Harry hangs up then slowly sits up, letting himself feel as
funky as he wants.

                    HARRY

          Everybody's out but old Har.. .Old, old
          old old Har...
Harry rises dizzily, crosses to the bookshelves. He rummages
around, finds ERICA'S SCRAPBOOK, pulls it out, randomly opens
it, finds a photo of Erica in the 70's, wearing a turtleneck.
Harry smiles.







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Harry wanders in with the scrapbook tucked under his arm. He
notices a bowl filled with white beach stones. Harry's brown
stone sits at the top of the pile.

                    HARRY

              (complimented)
          Top of the heap...

CLOSE ON JULIAN

Staring at Erica. He can't get enough of her. They're in a
ROMANTIC SEASIDE RESTAURANT. And Erica's blushing for the
first time in twenty-five years.

                    ERICA

          -- So, when the land came up, I snatched it
          and the house was built in record time and...
              (blushing to death)
          It's like a thousand degrees in here.

                    JULIAN

          You know, they say doctors fall for
          people who need rescuing, that we have a
          need to take care of someone.

                    ERICA

          Really? I never heard that one.
              (starts fanning herself
               with the menu)
          Julian, how old are you, like...

                    JULIAN

          -- Thirty-three.




                                              60.











          ERICA

Thirty-three.-Okay, so, I'm twenty years
older than you. More than twenty years
older than you.

          JULIAN

You look fabulous.

            ERICA

Thank you   but you know, I'm not sure
where you   were headed with that thing you
were just   saying, but in terms of us, you
just want   to be friends, right?

          JULIAN

Honestly? No.

          ERICA

Well, then, what is it that you...
want to be?

          J


           ULIAN

I think I'd embarrass you if I told
you.

          ERICA

I was embarrassed just getting
dressed to see you.

          JULIAN

This may surprise you but some
women consider me quite the guy.
I've never been married. I'm a
doctor. You wouldn't believe what
catnip that is for some women.

          ERICA

Oh yes I would. But, you don't like
girls your own age?

          JULIAN

I do very much. But I've never met one
I've taken to quite like this and when
something happens to you that's never
happened to you before, don't you have to
at least find out what it is?

          ERICA

I suppose but, see, I don't date
all that much or all that well...

          JULIAN

Oh, come on, you must beat them
away with a stick.




                                                          61.











                    ERICA

          Now you're kidding, right? No, guys
          my age, the ones I've met...well,
          I'm not that regular a person and
          they really like regular.

                    JULIAN

          Men your age may be really stupid,
          you ever think of that?
              (takes her hand)

                    ERICA

          Yes I have. Many times.

                    JULIAN

              (looks from her hand to
               her eyes)
          There's something radically wrong with
          the idea that no one loves you.
Ow. Right to the middle of her shoulder, then her neck.
Julian kisses her palm, then her.

                    JULIAN

          I knew you'd smell good.

                    ERICA

          It's just...soap...

                    JULIAN

          How much is soap that smells like this?

                    ERICA

          I don't know. I got it at the market.

                    JULIAN

          Erica, you're incredibly sexy.

                    ERICA

          No, swear to God, I'm not...







MEANWHILE, HARRY IS SOUND ASLEEP ON ERICA'S BED

Her scrapbook open against his chest. We HEAR the SOUND OF
ACAR pulling up to the house. Harry wakes up. Oh shit.   He
leaps out of bed, this is the fastest he's moved in days. A
bit disoriented, he straightens the covers, looks around for
other evidence then hightails it out of there.







INT. LIVING ROOM - A MOMENT LATER

Erica enters, letting out a huge sigh. She's brought back to
reality when she hears the TV in Harry's room. She heads his
way, then changes her mind and stops.




                                                        62.











                    ERICA

              (yells)
          I'm back...

                    HARRY (O.S.)

          You have fun?

                    ERICA

          It was interesting. So... Good night.







INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry's in bed, clearly disappointed that she didn't stop in.

                    HARRY

              (yells)
          'Night...







INT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - LATER

Erica, in pj's and glasses, sits at her laptop, writing. She
hears the CHIME of someone INSTANT MESSENGERING HER. It a
message from HARRYL37. It says: What R U doing?

 e go BACK AND FORTH between their TWO ROOMS.
She answers: Writing. Hi. What R U doing?
He writes: Watching Joan Rivers sell jewelry.
Erica laughs when he adds: So was your date a date?
She types: I think so...
He types: I told ya. (then) You hungry?
Surprised, she types: I just had dinner.
He writes: Yeah, but women never eat on dates.

                    ERICA

              (to herself)
          How does he know everything!
She hesitates then types: Actually am a little hungry but,
I'm in my pjs.
He writes: Me too. Pajama party?
SHE stares at the screen biting her lip. HE does the same.




                                                        63.










Erica rises, LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, checks out her boobs in her
pajamas. They look so low. She opens a drawer, rifles through it,
takes out a bra, takes out a better bra.
IN HIS BATHROOM, Harry fixes his hair, tries to make more of it
than he has.
Erica now wearing a bra under he pajamas, checks out her boobs
again. Better. She adjusts the straps. Lifts them higher.







INT. LIVING ROOM

Erica and Harry ENTER FROM OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE ROOM, both in
their pajamas.

                    HARRY

          We are cute...

                    ERICA

          This is pretty unusual for me.   I'm not
          used to having sleepovers.

                       HARRY

          Me either.

                    ERICA

          Really? With your social life?

                    HARRY

          My, dear, you are confusing sex with sleeping.
          Sleeping is something I prefer to do alone.

                    ERICA

          Okay, good to know.
              (heading for the kitchen)
          So, what are you hungry for?

                    HARRY

              (joining her)
          What are my choices? I mean I know you
          think I'm not very discriminating but...
She looks through the fridge.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, what's the difference what I
          think. I can't imagine what you think of
          me. Okay, so... Pasta, left over coq au
          vin, turkey sandwich or grilled cheese.

                       HARRY

          Pancakes.

                    ERICA

          Totally what I wanted. Blueberries?




                                                      64.











                    HARRY

          You ever miss being married? I bet you
          were great at it.

                    ERICA

          Sometimes I miss it. At night.. But not
          that much anymore. Was one of us just
          saying something interesting?

                    HARRY

          You said you can't imagine what I think
          of you.

                    ERICA

          Oh, right, but you don't have to answer
          that.

                    HARRY

          Okay.

                    ERICA

          I mean, if you had an opinion, I'd be
          curious but...'

                    HARRY

          will you tell me first why you only
          miss being married at night?

                    ERICA

              (cracking eggs)
          Oh, 'cause the phone doesn't ring as much
          at night and the "alone" thing happens at
          night and sleeping by myself took some
          getting used to. But I got the hang of
          it. You gotta sleep in the middle of the
          bed. It's absolutely not healthy to have
          a side when no one has the other side.
She starts mixing the batter.

                    HARRY

          Okay, now I'm convinced what I
          think of you is right.
              (Erica waits. . . )
          You are a tower of strength.

                    ERICA

              (shoulders sagging)
          Ughhhhhhhhhh... .

                    HARRY

          Try not to rate my answer.

                    ERICA

          I'm sorry. It's just...I'm sorry.




                                                        65.











                    HARRY

          You're like a thoroughbred in a world of
          mutts. No, you know what you are, you're
          like a great portrait over a fireplace.
          Words have been invented to describe
          women like you.

                    ERICA

              ( fearful)
          Such as?

                     HARRY

          Flinty   and...Impervious.

                    ERICA

          So you think I'm inhuman.

                    HARRY

          No. I think you're formidable.

                    ERICA

          But cold and distant. Like I'm
          frozen in some painting...

                    HARRY

          Not at all. I think you're strength
          defines you.
              (sees how sensitive she
               is)
          But it's thrilling when your defenses are
          down arid you're not isolated. That, I
          believe, is your winning combo. A killer
          combo actually.

                    ERICA

          ... So I can't decide if you hate me or if
          maybe you're the only person who ever got
          me.

                    HARRY

          I don't hate you.
The moment is broken when they HEAR the FRONT DOOR OPEN and

HIGH HEELS APPROACHING.


                    ERICA

          Hello?
Marin ARRIVES IN THE DOORWAY in a knockout of a dress holding
a bag from Zabars. She looks fresh, vibrant, sexy.

                    MARIN

          Room service!

                    ERICA

          What are you doing here at this hour?




                                                        66.










Erica and Harry have the air of kids caught making out by one
of their parents. Harry straightens out his pajamas, smooths
down his hair. Erica catches all this.

                    MARIN

              (enters, kisses Erica)

          I

            had this big photography auction
          tonight, then I went out with a
          bunch of people, I checked my
          messages and got this so sad
          message from Harry so bored out
          here. I thought I should come out
          and at least see how he was doing.
              (kisses Harry on the
               cheek)
          Thank you for the gorgeous flowers
          by the way. They were so huge...
Erica nods to herself. Oh, God, he sends them all flowers.
Harry notes Erica's reaction.

                    MARIN

          So how are you guys?
              (sets down the Zabar's
               bag)
          Oh, this is too sweet. You're making
          pancakes? Awwww. And you're both in your
          pj's. Now I feel I'm interrupting.

                    ERICA

          Don't be silly. You know I never
          sleep and this one doesn't sleep
          either. It's... .What's in the
          bag?

                    MARIN

              (reaches into the bag)
          A quart of matzoh ball soup for
          Harry. I know it's not the remedy
          for heart problems but it is low
          cholesterol.

                    ERICA

              (hating to correct her)
          But high sodium.

                    MARIN

          Oh, sorry. Stupid. For Mom, your
          favorite raisin-bread. And for
          me...
              (reaches into the bag)
          My favorite Vodka.
Marin's cell phone RINGS.




                                                          67.











                    MARIN

              (into phone)
          Hello? No I'm here, babe. Made record
          time. Everyone's still there?
Erica feeling suddenly frumpy, fixes her hair. Harry watches
her. She catches him and shrugs. Marin flips her phone shut
and tosses it in her purse.

                    ERICA

          So, Mar, now that you're here, why
          don't you finish the pancakes and
          I'll get back to work...

                    MARIN

          Mom! I just got here, hold on.
She pours a healthy Vodka into a glass, grabs some ice.

                    MARIN

          So your ex-husband stood me up
          today. We were supposed to have
          lunch at Barneys . He never showed
          up. Was he always like this?

                    ERICA

          Honey, I don't know...

                    MARIN

          This is what happens after a couple
          gets divorced, the kid inherits all
          the problems. Not that I'm a kid.
              (then to Harry, the flirt
               in her coming back)
          So how are you, how do you feel?
          When can you go home?
Just as harry is about to answer, Marin's cell RINGS. She
picks it up, looks at her caller ID, throws it back in her
bag.

                     ERICA

          I really am gonna do a little work.
          . . you two catch up. . . and just
          flip these Hin like two seconds.

                     ARRY

          You don't want pancakes anymore?

                    ERICA

          I, uh, I don't think I...I...
              (looks at Marin so)
          gorgeous, next to him
          No. I don't.




                                                        68.










Marin watches her mother EXIT then looks to Harry, his eyes
following her Mom out the door. She's sees a look on Harry's
face she never remotely saw when he looked at her. At first
she's shocked. He likes my mother??? Then a flash of
jealousy. He likes my mother!?! Then pure joy - realizing how
perfect it is.







INT. BRIDGEHAMPTON GENERAL STORE - DAY

Erica, back in a turtleneck, picks peaches out of a basket.
Marin ENTERS HER FRAME, baseball cap, sunglasses, picking
cherries.

                    MARIN

          I'm breaking up with Harry.

                    ERICA

          Why? What do you mean?

                    MARIN

          'Cause I met someone else.

                    ERICA

          In the two days you've been gone?

                    MARIN

          You know me, my life's crazy. I meet a
          thousand people everyday. Also, let's
          face it, the guy's insanely old for me.
          I'd be nuts to keep this going.

                    ERICA

          True, but you know he is....

                    MARIN

          -- I know. He's soulful when you
          don't expect it, right?

                    ERICA

          It's unnerving.

                    MARIN

          Now, Mom, if you could handle this,
          I was thinking... you and Harry...

                     ERICA

          I can't handle it. Wouldn't want to
          handle it.

                    MARIN

          But you're only saying that 'cause
          you think he and I have had sex.

                    ERICA

          Yes. Lower your voice. Haven't you?




                                                        69.











                    MARIN

              (whispering)
          Never even got close. Swear to God.
              (Erica digests this)
          Just puttin' that out there...'cause for
          two people who are convinced they got
          life beat, there's was somethin' cooking
          in the kitchen last night other than
          pancakes.







INT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Erica looks out her KITCHEN WINDOW and SEES Marin and Harry
TALKING ON THE BEACH. She leans so far to see them, she's
about to lose her balance. The Phone RINGS, she reaches for
it and slips right Out Of Frame.

                    ERICA (O.S.)

              (into phone)
          Hello.







INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

Julian, in his scrubs, walks quickly down a hallway of the

                     J

ER, on his CELL PHONE.

                     ULIAN

          I've waited a reasonable amount of hours
          before calling you, even though you've
          been on my mind since I woke up at 5:15.
          I'm wondering when we could have dinner
          again? I have to work the next few nights
          and if we wait 'til next week, I know
          you'll chicken out so how's Friday? I
          know it's like a date night but I think
          that's good.

                    ERICA

          Who is this?
Julian stops short.

                    ERICA

          I'm kidding!

                    JULIAN

          Can you meet me at The Grill at
          eight?

                    ERICA

          Okay. Yes. That's seems fine.




I














                                                          70.











                    JULIAN

          I look forward to, seeing you too.
Erica smiles to herself.







ON JULIAN - AS HE LEANS AGAINST A WALL

turning off the phone and grabbing his heart

 NT. ERICA'S KITCHEN

Marin ENTERS through the kitchen door, looking almost a
little dazed.

                    MARIN

          Okay, he's all yours.

                    ERICA

          Stop that. How'd he take it?

                    MARIN

          He just took care of it for me; He
          was an ace. Elegant. Said our fate
          was to be friends. ...Oh my God.
              (realizes something)
          He was breaking up with me. He's a
          genius.

                    ERICA

          That's impossible, he wouldn't...

                    MARIN

          It doesn't matter, we're done and
          we both feel good about it.
              (hugs her)
          I gotta get back.
              (as she exits)
          Now Erica, try to think of this as
          the smartest thing you've ever done
          for yourself.
Marin EXITS and the PHONE RINGS.

                    ERICA

              (into the phone)
          Hello.

                    HARRY

          (from the beach)
          Thought you'd like to know your
          daughter broke up with me.
Harry and Erica talk while looking at each other through the
Kitchen Window.




                                                        71.











                     ERICA

          I heard.

                    HARRY

          Made up a story about meeting another
          guy. Guess I wasn't so cute with an IV in
          my arm.

                    ERICA

          No, I think she really did meet
          someone else.

                    HARRY

          Hey, it's alright. Her mother
          didn't like me anyway.

                    ERICA

              (smiles)
          How 'bout I bring you out some
          lunch and a couple of blood

                    H

          pressure pills?

                     ARRY

          You're a great woman, Erica.
              (Erica relaxes)
          Is this why my doctor is falling in
          love with you?

THE BEACH - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Harry sit on a blanket on a cloudy day having a
picnic lunch. Harry is telling Erica a story and she screams
with laughter.

BROWN STONES IN THE SAND - MUSIC CONTINUES

Erica picks them up as.she walks with Harry by the water's
edge. They talk non-stop.

A LITTLE LATER - LIGHTNING STREAKS THE SKY

Out of nowhere, a downpour. Erica and Harry gather their
picnic things. The blanket starts to fly and Harry grabs it
as Erica runs after a plate spinning away in the wind.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Erica and Harry, wet from the rain, quickly shut all the
doors and windows. Lightning crackles across the sky and THE

LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE GO OUT.


A MATCH IS STRUCK

and a CANDLE is lit. Then ANOTHER ONE, and ANOTHER ONE. Erica
turns and finds Harry just looking at her. Before either of
them has time to think, they kiss.




                                                        72.











                       ERICA

          I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

              (truly confused)
          For what?

                    ERICA

          I just kissed you.

                    HARRY

          No, honey, I kissed you.
Relieyed, Erica kisses him.

                    ERICA

          I know that one was me.

                    HARRY

          Try not to keep score.
He kisses her again and again.

                    HARRY

          Soft lips...

                    ERICA

          I'm so glad they still work.
I haven't used them for kissing in so long. They've been more
like for wearing lipstick and whistling and...
He kisses her quiet. Relieved, she finally fully kisses him
back. A big gorgeo~s kiss.

                    HARRY

          Well, well, now look who's got
something that works...
They both look down at Harry. Hello, Mr. Midnight.

                    ERICA

          And you didn't even take Via-

                     HARRY

              (puts his finger on her
               lips)
          Kiss me before you make it go away.

S

 he kisses him long and sweet.

ERICA'S BED

They're kissing on it. The rain pelts against the windows as
the sun goes down.




                                                        73.











                    HARRY

          This could be world class
          interesting.
              (Erica nods)
          Having any doubts?

                       ERICA

                 (as they kiss)
          Yes.

                       HARRY

          Me too.

                    ERICA

          But so far the kissing is
          spectacular.
              (He looks at her)
          I'm not grading you, just
          mentioning it. Brilliant.
He tries to kiss her neck but the turtleneck is in the way.
He pulls it down, but it's tight and it's, difficult to get
to her.

                    HARRY

          Can't get past your damn
          turtleneck. . .
He tries lifting the shirt from the bottom, it's awkward, he
doesn't want to be down there yet. He comes back up when
Erica reaches to her night table, slides opens the drawer,
takes out a SCISSORS and hands it to him.

                    ERICA

              (breathless)
          Cut it off... Please.
What a brilliant invitation. He takes the scissors and starts
cutting from the bottom, right past her belly, up her torso,
between her breasts. The turtleneck falls open from the
center. When he reaches her neck, he gently tears at it and
it easily rips apart and there she is. He takes her in.

                    HARRY

          You're beautiful.
She shakes her head, 'no' ...shuts her eyes.

                    HARRY

          Open your eyes so I know you can hear me.
              (she opens her eyes)
          Beautiful...
They kiss and she reaches down for his pants.




                                                        74.











                    HARRY

          What about birth control?

                       ERICA

          Menopause.

                    HARRY

              (thrilled)
          Who's the lucky boy...
He kisses between her breasts, her stomach, heads down and
OUT OF FRAME. Erica can't quite believe life held this twist
for her. Then:,

                    ERICA

          I think we should take your blood
          pressure.
His head POPS BACK INTO FRAME. What?????

                    ERICA

          It's irresponsible not to.

H


 ARRY -' A MINUTE LATER

sprawled out on the bed. Erica straddles him and whips the
blood pressure cuff on his arm and pumps it hard. Like a warm
Jewish Mother of a Dominatrix. He looks up at her, shaking
his head...

                    HARRY

          Nobody but you would. . .

                    ERICA

          Yeah...so you're lucky.
Erica grabs Harry's glasses, reads the results.

                    ERICA

              (ecstatic)
          One twenty over eighty!!! Baby!







THE BLOOD PRESSURE CUFF - IN SLOW MOTION

hurdles recklessly into the air.

EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT - LATER

The rain is coming down in torrents.

INSIDE

We are CLOSE ON ERICA'S FACE - UPSIDE DOWN, hanging off the
side of the bed. She's sweaty, flushed, overwhelmed...




                                                           75.














                    ERICA

          Oh my God, I do like sex.
CAMERA TWIRLS AROUND and we FIND HARRY, sprawled nearby,
catching his breath, satisfied, stunned, scared.

                    HARRY

          You certainly do.
Erica arrives next to him, also out of breath.

                    ERICA

          Wow. So this is what you're supposed to
          do on a rainy afternoon...
Harry smiles. He's trying to be his debonair self but
something's off. He's very aware of himself. They lie there
quietly for a second when Erica begins to tear up. Harry
slowly, nervously turns to her.

                    ERICA

          I really thought I was sorta closed for
          business. Just never expected this.

                     HARRY

              (nods)
          Nothin's ever surprised me more...
Flattered, Erica snuggles up close. Harry puts his arm around
her. Then, with no warning, his eyes fill with tears.

                    HARRY

          This is crazy. I can't remember the last
          time I cried. I think I'm overwhelmed.

                    ERICA

              (crying with him)
          Me too. That's the perfect word.

                    HARRY

          Baby, I had sex three days after a heart
          attack and I didn't die!
Erica pauses. Oh. That kind of overwhelmed.

                    HARRY

          That's gotta be some kind of record.
Good sport Erica gives him a double thumbs up.

                    ERICA

              (wiping her tears)
          Let's not brag about this to our
          doctor, okay?




                                                           76.











                    HARRY

          Honey I may not be many things but one -
          thing I am is a gentleman.
Harry holds her close.

                    HARRY

          Erica, Erica, Erica.
              (she turns to him)
          You know I'm not good at being
          monogamous, right?

                    ERICA

          Monogamous? Please, I hardly know
          you.
He looks at her wondering if she's for real. She smiles as
she wipes a small tear from the corner of her eye. Then he
kisses her.

LATER - THEY'RE HUDDLED UNDER THE COVERS


C

 ozy. Candles light the room. It's still raining.

                    HARRY

          -- So there I was at nineteen, in New
          York, by myself, and I'd never seen snow
          before and I didn't have enough money for
          the bus, so I had to walk. Had no idea
          how far it was and I'm talking blizzard
          and I'm in sneakers.

                    ERICA

          Awwwww,. . .

LATER - THEY'RE LYING ON A CHAISE

in Erica's room, making out. A Cell Phone RINGS. They both
look around for it. Erica reaches for it on her desk.

                    ERICA

              (disoriented)
          Hello? I mean...Hello.
              (turns phone upside down)
          Hello.







INTERCUT WITH MARIN IN A TAXI IN THE CITY - IT'S POURING


                    MARIN

          Mom, you guys okay out there?

                    ERICA

          We're fine. Why? What's going on?




                                                        77.











                    MARIN

          What do you mean, it's like a
          hurricane. The news said the winds
          are like a zillion miles an hour.

                    ERICA

          Oh, that. Oh, no, we're fine...




                    MARIN

          Are you having sex? Tell the truth.
          You are, aren't you.

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No. That is not
          going on now.

                    MARIN

          Oh my God, you already did it. Was
          it amazing?

                    ERICA

          I have to go.

                    MARIN

          Just tell me, was it amazing?

                    ERICA

          Yes and thank you for the wonderful
          opportunity.
Marin SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMS. Erica flips the phone shut, looks to
Harry, embarassed.

                    ERICA

              (to Harry)
          Am I interested in buying aluminum
          siding. . .

                    HARRY

          Really? Marin's selling aluminum siding?
Erica buries her face in his chest.

LATER

Harry and Erica SIT ON STOOLS AT THE KITCHEN ISLAND, drinking
wine and eating scrambled eggs right out of the pan. Candles
light the room.

                    HARRY

          --But why Paris?

                    ERICA

          I just always wanted to write a play that
          ended there.




                                                        78.











                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          People need romance like that. And if
          someone like me doesn't write it, where
          they gonna get it? Real life?

                    HARRY

              (slightly insulted)
          Excuse me. What do you call this? Eating
          eggs by candlelight in our robes after...
She kisses him, starts to say, "I'm sorry" when he pulls her
back, kisses her again, then looks at her hard, perplexed.

CLIMBING BACK UNDER THE COVERS


                    HARRY

          So where do you like to eat in
          Paris?    E

                     RICA

          Oh, I love this place called Le Balzar,
          it's just a little bistro on the Left
          Bank, best roast chicken in the universe.

                    HARRY

          You'd be fun to go to Paris with.

                     ERICA

          It's a great city to stay up all
          night in.
              (then)
          When's your birthday?

                      HARRY

          February.

                    ERICA

          Mine's in January. So, how 'bout if we
          still know each other by then we go to
          Paris for our birthdays.

                     HARRY

              (a beat, then)
          Maybe. . .

                    ERICA

          Oh. Sorry. You just...
              (sees the look on his
              face) .
          I have no idea how to do this...be
          intimate but not...The color is draining
          from your face. Okay, look, I'm gonna
          pee,take one of your blood pressure pills
          then when I get back, let's not talk
          anymore.




                                                          79.










She gets out of bed.

                    HARRY

          You're the funniest girl I ever had
          sex with.
She has no idea how to take that. Decides to accept it.

                    ERICA

          That's somethin'...

                       HARRY

          Honey... ?
She turns, sees he's getting out of bed, approaching her.

                    HARRY

          I think I'm gonna go back to my
          room...let you sleep.

                     ERICA

          Let me sleep? Oh, right...you usually
          send the girls home. . .but I am home...
          so...okay.

                    HARRY

          I'm an old dog, you' know.

                    ERICA

          Hey, it's perfectly. .. whatever.
          Good night. This was..This was a
          great night. For me...

                    HARRY

          Me too. At one point I even thought
          soul mates, you know...
Erica nods. She knows.

HARRY FLOPS ONTO HIS BED

stares straight up at the ceiling.

INT. ERICA'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Erica gets back in her bed. She lies there for a
second,securing her armor back in place. She routinely moves
to the middle of the bed,neatens out the covers and shuts her
eyes. Then a small KNOCK on her open door. She sees Harry in
the doorway.

                    HARRY

          I'd like to try sleeping with you.




I














                                                          80.










Erica hesitates, then moves to one side of the bed and as
Harry climbs in next to her we:

                                          FADE THRU TO:


EXT. HOUSE - THE FOLLOWING MORNING

The place is a mess, the aftermath of the storm.

HNT. ERICA'S BEDROOM - THE SAME TIME

 arry spoons with Erica on her side of 'the bed, his arms
snuggly around her. The ELECTRICITY POPS BAGK ON and the room
is suddenly lit up and one of Erica's French CDs comes on
full blast.
Harry opens his eyes. He's surprised to see he has his arm
around her. Erica awakens just as surprised. In the light of
day, a definite hint of embarrassment ...

                    HARRY

              (grabs his watch, blinks)
          Can you see this?

                    ERICA

          Not really but it looks like it
          says eleven.

                    HARRY

              (slips on his glasses)
          It is eleven...

                    ERICA

          It can't be, that would mean we
          slept eight hours.

                    HARRY

          Impossible.
They turn and finally look at each other. Both look wrinkled,
messy haired, a little wiped.

                    HARRY

          How ya doin' Ace?
              (she ,elts as he lies
               right back down)
          Whoa Nelly...little dizzy.

                    ERICA

          Okay, just stay still, here's the
          clicker. You know you have a
          doctor's appointmQnt in an hour.
              (getting out of bed)

              (MORE )





                                                        81.














                    ERICA (CONT'D)

          I'll make us some coffee, get you your
          pills, whip us up some french toast, I
          have ,the best maple syrup ever. '

                    HARRY

          Erica...
              (she turns)
          You are a woman to love.
Erica smiles, then walks away with the achey walk of a woman
who hasn't had sex in many a year but has more than made up
for it in the last 12 hours. She holds onto the wall as she
exits the room, a little bow-legged, like she's just gotten
off a horse. Alone in the hallway, she stops.

                    ERICA

          You are woman to love. What the
          hell does that mean?

AN EKG MACHINE

Spits out a long tape. TILT UP to Julian at the end of the
tape. Harry sits on an examining table in JULIAN'S OFFICE,
buttoning up his shirt.

                    JULIAN

          Okay, buddy, I'm sending you home. These
          past few days have done wonders for you.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, I've been working on that stair
          thing. I can do it by the way.

                    J


                     ULIAN

          Do what?

                    HARRY

              (quickly)
          Climb a flight of stairs. Several times
          actually.
Harry stands, tucks in his shirt, smiling proudly to himself.

                    JULIAN

          Way to go. How's Erica?

                    HARRY

              (caught)
          Erica?

                    JULIAN

          I know you must know her name by
          now.




                                                        82.














                    HARRY

          Yes, I do. Erica, as it turns out
          is an amazing woman. Does whatever
          she can to make me happy. Really.
          Turns out she's very giving.
Julian, suddenly riveted to these words.

                    HARRY

          Very giving.

                    JULIAN

              (looking away)
          Yeah, well that's wonderful. I
          think she's wonderful.
A real moment between them. Julian decides to take the high
road.

                    HARRY

          I think she's wonderful too.

                    JULIAN

              (gathering his things)
          Give her my best...

                    HARRY

          Julian. Thanks for everything.
Julian shakes Harry's hand. Harry's eyes TEAR UP.

                    JULIAN

          You're gonna be okay.

                    HARRY

              (touching his tears)
          What the...? This is the second
          time I've done this now. I get
          overcome or something. . .

                    JULIAN

          It's very common to become emotional
          after having an episode like you've had.
          Everything takes on a new meaning.

                    HARRY

              (wiping his tears)
          So it's not crazy for a man to do
          something entirely out of character
          after having a heart attack?

                    JULIAN

              (handing him Kleenex)
          Like crying?




                                                        83.











                    HARRY

          Yeah and totally changing their
          tastes. Like suddenly really liking
          something they never thought they
          could like...ever...and I'm talking
          really liking it. It's...unnerving.

                    JULIAN

          I think you can expect just about
          anything right now. People have done some
          wild things after having a heart
          attack...selling businesses, getting
          divorced, moving... Some people say it
          saved their lives.

                    HARRY

          But most people go back to being
          themselves, right? I'll go back to
          being me, won't I?

                    J


                        ULIAN

          We'll see.







ERICA - TYPING - HER PHONE RINGS

She wears a blouse with more buttons unbuttoned than ever in
her life. She picks up the phone.

HARRY DRIVES ERICA'S CAR, TOP DOWN.


                       HARRY

                 (on his cell)
          Hi.

                      ERICA

          Hey.    What'd he say?

                    HARRY

          He said you're wonderful.

                    ERICA

          No, really, what'd he say...How are you?

                    HARRY

          He said I'm good..that I can go.

                     . ERICA

              (obviously conflicted)
          Oh. So... Congratulations. That's really.
          . . great.

                    HARRY

          Yeah, he said... by tomorrow for absolute
          sure. You think you can deal with me for
          one more night?




                                                        84.














A CROWDED CLUB - SOUTHAMPTON - THAT NIGHT

Packed with Young People. In the middle of this twentysomething
sun burnt beach crowd, we find, Erica and Harry, the two coolest
people in the room, dancing with each other.

A LITTLE 'LATER - THE KARAOKE ROOM

Harry leads Erica through a crowd listening to a Girl singing
Britney Spears' Oops, I Did It Again. When she finishes the
crowd enthusiastically applauds.

                    HARRY

              (big breath)
          Okay, here goes...

                    ERICA

          Here goes what?

                    HARRY

          Here goes me singing to you...
              (pulling a DISC out of his
               pocket)
          Bought my own music.

                    ERICA

          You knew they had karaoke?

                    HARRY

          Baby, it's why we're here. .
Harry makes his way TO THE STAGE, hands them his disc. He's
handed a microphone. He looks right at Erica.

                    HARRY

          This is for you, Ace...
              (then, under his breath)
          wish me luck.
The Music begins and it is an instrumental version of one of
Erica's French Songs, "I Wish You Love".

                    HARRY

              (sings)
          I wish you bluebirds in the spring... To
          Give your heart a song to sing... And
          then a kiss, but more than this... I wish
H         you love...
 arry takes out a sheet of paper and his glasses.

                    HARRY

          Don't want to blow this part...
Now Harry sings the rest of the song IN FRENCH. . .




                                                           85.











-.


                    HARRY

              (sings)
          Et en juillet une limonade...Pour
          vous refroidir dans quelque lefy
          glade...
And so on... Erica watches knowing something in her life has
just that second, forever changed. And as Harry continues
singing, we:

                                         CUT TO:


LOWELL - THE NEXT DAY

Packing the Trunk of the Town Car in front of Erica's house.

INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME

Harry tosses his pills in a leather bag. .. Erica enters
doing the worst job she's ever done of being strong.

                    ERICA

              (holding some cigars)
          Here you go, you can have these back now.
              (Harry looks confused)
          I confiscated them your first night
          here...

                    HARRY

              (smells them)
          Thank you darlin' ...

                    ERICA

          Try not to smoke them...
              (hands him a small bag)
          And I packed you a sandwich, just
          in case your blood sugar got low.
          And some of that iced-tea you like,
          and a nonfat, low cholesterol
          cookie. And a peach.

                    HARRY

          what a doll...
              (notices)
          Got something else?
From behind her back Erica pulls out a Mason Jar filled with
all dark beach stones with ONE WHITE STONE in the center.

                    ERICA

          Something to remember me by.
Harry hugs her. Erica awkwardly throws her arms around him
and kisses him, then kisses him better. He's moved by her.




                                                          86.











                    HARRY

          There is that...

                    ERICA

          And hey, we'll always have Paris.

                    HARRY

          Honey, no words can ever express my
          gratitude for taking me in and taking care
          of me and...

                    ERICA

          Hey, your heart attack could be the best
          thing that ever happened to me.

                     HARRY

              (kisses her quickly, even
               faster throws out)
          I love ya.

                    ERICA

          I love you too...if that's what you said. I
          don't know if it ends in 'ya' if it's an
          official I love you but...
Harry expression looks something like he's in pain. Then. . .

                    HARRY

          You're not like anybody.

                    ERICA

          Neither are you.







INT. CAR - MOVING AWAY FROM THE HOUSE - DAY

Lowell drives, rattling on about all the people who have been
calling about him. Harry, in the backseat, looks back at the
house, until it is finally out of view.
Harry then looks inside the bag with the sandwich and finds an
Envelope from Erica, pulls it out, doesn't open it, places it back
in the bag then takes out his cell phone and dials.

INT. ERICA'S LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - OVER, THE PHONE RINGS

The room is empty. Erica rushes in, picks up the phone.

                     E


                     RICA

          I knew you'd call.

MARIN - WALKING IN SOHO

on her cell phone, CRYING.




                                                          87.











                     MARIN

           Who? It's me.

INTERCUT


                     ERICA

           What's wrong?

                     MARIN

           I had breakfast with Dad this morning and
           we're talking and he starts looking all
           weir~ and then he tells me he met someone
           three weeks ago and it's "really
           something and then he
               (sobbing now)
           He tells me he's getting married. Why am
           I reacting this way? I'm almost thirty
           years old...
               (people stare at her)
           Yes, I'm crying, leave me alone.

                     ERICA

           Who's he marrying?

                     MARIN

           I don't know. Some chick he met three
           weeks ago. She's four years older than me
           and she's an Ear, Nose and Throat Doctor.
           Has he lost his mind? I have a huge
           auction tonight... Why do I have to be
           the one to deal with this? Can you please
           come in? I'm rea:~y upset, my shrink'~
           away for two weeks...I know you're
           working but. . .please. . ?

AN UPPER EAST SIDE STREET - A LITTLE LATER

One of those gorgeous tree lined streets from a Woody Allen
movie that makes New York seem quaint. Harry's Town Car
pulls up in front of a GORGEOUS   PRISTINE TOWNHOUSE. Harry
steps out in shades, holding an   unlit cigar. Lowell joins him
as the Front Door opens and out   pours his Two Leggy
Assistants and thumping Hip Hop   Music.
LOWELL Good to be back?
HARRY Let's find out.

EXT. ERICA'S HOUSE - LATER

Camera quickly TRACKS Erica down the front path and to her
car. She's on her cell.




                                                        88.











                    ERICA

          Hold on, I'm losing you. Okay,    so you'll
          let Harry know I'll be. in the    city
          tonight and he can reach me on    my
          cell...if he wants... Okay? Aw    shit.
          Hello?

EXT. SOTHEBY'S AUCTION HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

A Crowd files in for tonight's auction.

INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - SAME TIME

A tearful Marin is changing from jeans and a T-shirt to a
proper dress and heels. Erica leans on a table, listening.

                     MARIN

          -- Look, I get that he has a right to get
          remarried, but he doesn't even know her
          and she's like my age. You know what
          that's like? It's like beyond creepy. And
          I know he's not replacing me so why does
          it feel like he is? This is crazy, right?
          Crying like this...

              (

                lights a cigarette)

                    ERICA

          Honey, if he's replacing anyone, it's me.
          And all the statistics say divorced men
          almost always remarry. That's just the
          way they're built.

                    MARIN

              (slipping on her dress)
          Mom, you want to know the answer to
          the big mystery of my life? Why I'm
          always with the wrong guy? This is
          why. Because the wrong guy can't do
          this to you. You have some control
          with the wrong guy. This thing I'm
          feeling right now. This is my big
          fear...that some guy could get me
          unglued like this, like nothing's
          connected. And this is just my
          father! I'm just not strong enough
          to handle this kind of drama.

                    ERICA

          The drama in life is what makes you
          strong.

                    MARIN

          No, it's what makes you strong.
          You've never really understood
          this,but we're not all like you.




                                                      89.











                    MARIN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry, if I were you and my ex
          husband, the man who I still allow to
          direct my plays.! was getting married to
          some 33 year old Ear, Nose and Throat
          Babe, I'd be bonkers. And look at you.
              (realizes)
          You've never looked better, by the way.
              (sinks)
          My anti-depressant is obviously not
          working. It should cover events like this
          shouldn't it?

                    ERICA

          Since when do you take an antidepressant?

                    MARIN

          Ugggh, mother, do you know anyone who
          doesn't?

                       ERICA

          Yes. Me.

                    MARIN

          I rest my case.
A KNOCK on the door.

                    VOICE FROM OUTSIDE

          Marin, we're all set.

                    MARIN

          Mom, can you do one other really
          big thing for me? Just say yes.

                    ERICA

              (taking two Turns)
          Anything bubee.

                    MARIN

          Will you come out to dinner tonight
          with me and Dad and the fiance?

                    ERICA

          Absolutely not. No.

                    MARIN

          Please. He wants me to meet her and I can
          not go alone. I already asked him if you
          could come and he said it was fine and
          she said it was fine. Look, you're gonna
          have to meet her too, so, we might as
          well meet her together. Come on, you know
          you can handle it.




                                                        90.










Erica pauses, thinks M
                     about it. She knows she can too.

                      ARIN

           Okay. That's it. See that look on
           your face. That's the gene I didn't
           get.

INT. SOTHEBY' S - MOMENTS LATER

Marin, now all pulled together, stands at the podium in front
of a packed house. If' you didn't know, you'd never guess.

                     MARIN

           Good evening and welcome to Sotheby's and
           this evening's sale of Impressionistic
           and Modern Art. Bidders should know that
           the auctioneer may open bidding on any
           lot below the reserve by placing a bid on
           behalf of the seller. Okay...Let's start
           with Lot I, the Bonnard drawing. And

           gentleman's bid, 7500 is here, 8000 on
           the phone. . .

ON ERICA

in the back of the room, watching with pride and worry. She
slips out her cell, checks her messages. Her phone lights up
and tells her she has "0" Voice Mail.

A CLOCK ON THE WALL - IT'S 8:30

We are in ERICA'S EMPTY KITCHEN in The Hamptons and her phone
is RINGING.

ANGLE - A CELL PHONE

as A Man's HAND turns it off. We are:

INT. HAMPTON'S RESTAURANT

Julian sits at a table, by himself, in a coat and tie,
tucking away his phone. The Waiter sympathetically approaches
the table.

                     JULIAN

           Guess I got stood up.

                     WAITER

           Would you like to order or...?




                                                        91.











                    JULIAN

          Why not, I put. on the tie and
          everything. And can you bring me
          another. . .
              (indicating his drink)
Julian takes a look at the menu, then looks away.

TWO DINNER PLATES ARE CARRIED THROUGH THE RESTAURANT

and as the CAMERA WIDENS we realize we are:

IN A CHIC CAFE IN MANHATTAN - LATER THAT NIGHT

Camera takes us to Erica, Marin, Dave and DAVE'S FIANCE, KRISTEN,
a combo of a hot tie and a young professional. Everyone has menus
and drinks. A Waiter delivers two new Martinis for Marin and
Erica. They both go right for them. Erica drinks too much too
fast.                D

                     AVE

              (to Erica)
          Thirsty?

                    ERICA

          I've had a big week Dave, forgot how
          these slip right down. I'm fine. So,
          Kristen, where'd you go to...
              (burps)
          --medical school? Excuse me.

                    KRISTEN

          University of Pennsylvania.

                    ERICA

          I went to school in Philadelphia
          too.

                    DAVE

          Bryn Mawr girl.

                     KRISTEN

          That's amazing. My Mom went to Bryn
          Mawr . . .

                    MARIN

          Wow. So not only are you marrying my father
          but our mothers went to the same college.
Marin takes out a pack of cigarettes.

                    MARIN

          Anyone mind?

                    KRISTEN

          Actually I do.




                                      92.











          MARIN

Okay, I'll just..have one.
    (lights up)
So, this isn't going badly so far
is it? I mean for a totally surreal
situation like this.

          DAVE

Shall we order?

          KRISTEN

Absolutely.

          DAVE

    (peruses menu)
Erica, do I like duck?

          ERICA

Yes. It's rabbit you hate.
    (to Kristen)
I'll give you a list of everything
he likes and dislikes.

          DAVE

Let's let her figure some things
out on her own.

          ERICA

I didn't mean those things, Dave.
She did go to medical school.

          MARIN

    (pointing to herself and
    Kristen)
Hey, not in front of the kids.

          ERICA

    (polishing off her
     Martini)
I will tell you this...Dave has one
truly great love in his life.

          KRISTEN

Really? What's that?

             ERICA

His balls.

          DAVE

Okay, I forgot to mention she can't
drink hard liquor.
    (to Marin)
Why did you order her a Martini?




                     E














                                                        93.











                    ERICA

          What? It's not true? The man can not
          watch TV or read without the hand down
          the pants-- Here's my advice after 21
          years I say who cares, they're his
          balls,let him enjoy 'em.

                    MARIN

              (chokes)
          I think I swallowed my olive, whole.
Erica looks up and sees something that takes her breath away.

A COUPLE ZIGZAGGING AROUND TABLES

and headed in her direction. A sexy Young Thing followed by
her date -- no other than Harry. Harry stops to shake
someone's hand, holds his date around the waist. Suddenly,
the SOUND DROPS OUT of the restaurant as Harry and his Date
walk right by Erica's table in SLOW MOTION, not noticing her.

M


 OVING IN ON ERICA

as the room comes alive again. Her eyes follow Harry as he is
seated only one table away, his back to Erica, his Date
facing her. Marin hasn't seen him. Erica tries her hardest to
act normal but apparently isn't.

                    MARIN

          Mom, you okay?

                    ERICA

          Yeah, fine.
Erica looks at her menu then her eyes go right back to Harry.
His Date is laughing at something Harry is saying. Harry
leans in to her, whispers something to her. She touches his
hand.

                     RICA

          You know what? Maybe I need a little
          air...
Erica rises; grabs her purse, almost bumps into a Waiter as
she passes Harry's table, knocks into someone's chair, a
glass breaks. Everyone turns to her, including Harry. She now
stands right at his table. He smiles up at her.

                     HARRY

          Hey.

                    ERICA

          Hello... Harry.
              (to his Date)
          Hello...




                                                          94.











EXT. RESTAURANT

Erica rushes out. She's a little high and her heart is
pounding. She heads down the street.

                    ERICA

          Oh, God, I'm so stupid...
She picks up her pace, starts running. Her cell phone RINGS.

                    ERICA

          Hello?
Intercut Harry and Erica on their cells, a block apart.

                    HARRY

              (walking quickly)
          Slow down. You want to kill me?
She considers it.

                    ERICA

          Harry, I gotta go...

                    HARRY

          Erica, she's just a friend.

                     ERICA

          Yeah, she looks like a buddy kind
          of a girl.
Erica reaches a corner, can't get across, turns the corner.
Harry ARRIVES NEXT TO HER.

                    HARRY

          Come on, it's just a dinner...

                    ERICA

          Look, Harry, here's the problem. I
          really like you.

                    HARRY

          I really like you.

                    ERICA

          Yeah, but I love you like you.
              (that stops him)
          I do. I love you.
Harry swoons and not in a good way.

                    HARRY

          I think maybe you should consider
          that you're in love with the idea
          of being in love.




                                             95.














          ERICA


D

 o you? Okay. Oh, God...
    (stomps her feet)
I'm like the dumb girl who doesn't get it.
    (tries not to cry in front
     of him)
I've never been the dumb girl
before. It ain't so great.

          HARRY

Let's just calm down. This was just
a a meal with a friend.

           ERICA

-- Did you know I called you seven
hours ago?

          HARRY

I was gonna call you. I've been jamming
all day, it's my first day back.

          ERICA

Uh-huh. . .

          HARRY

I had these plans before I met you. But I
do like seeing you. I do. I'm always
surprised by it.

          ERICA

What was I thinking?

          HARRY

Maybe you weren't thinking for once and
look what a good time we had. Let's not
ruin something great.

          ERICA

Harry, I won't be good at this.

           HARRY

At what?

          ERICA

Acting like I don't care.

          HARRY

I have never lied to you. I have always
told you some version of the truth.

          ERICA

    (freaking on that one)
The truth doesn't have versions.




                                            96.











          HARRY

Can you cut me a little slack? My
life's been turned upside down.

          ERICA

Yeah. Mine too.

          HARRY

Then let's each get our bearings.

          ERICA

I don't want my bearings. I've had my
bearings my whole fucking life. I felt
something with you that... Oh, you don't
want to-

          HARRY

Yes I do.
    (she won't open up)
Tell me.

          ERICA

I felt something with you, I didn't know
really existed. You know what that's like
after a twenty year marriage? To feel
something for another person that's so
off the charts, that -
    (Harry looks down)
Okay, not your problem. This is why
I'm not good in relationships. You
know writers are like teachers,
those who can - do, those who can't
- write romantic comedies where
THIS does not happen in the third
act...and it certainly does not
happen to a 55 year old woman. In
the play I'll be 36 so it won't be
as pathetic. I'm just too old to
feel crushed.I've written this
feeling but I never really got it.
    (realizes)
You know what this is?
    (pointing to herself)
This is heart broken. How's that
for impervious?

          HARRY

You're killin' me.

          ERICA

I just wish it had lasted more than a
week.

          HARRY

Me too.




                                                      97.











                    ERICA

          That's a horrible thing to say.
              (walks off, comes back)
          The life I had before I met you. I
          knew how to do that, could do that
          forever. Now look at me...what do I
          do with all this?

                    HARRY

          Can we talk tomorrow?

                    ERICA

          What for? I saw your friend you were
          having dinner with, if that's what you
          want, it's never going to work with me.
          Look at me. I'm a middle aged woman,
          don't let this brown hair fool you, I
          don't have a real brown hair on my head,
          I'm almost all grey...that would freak
          you out, wouldn't it? And I have. high
          cholesterol and my back hurts every
          morning and I'm post menopausal and I
          have osteoperosis and I'm sure arthritis
          is just around the corner and I know
          you've seen my vericose veins. Let's face
          it man, that's not quite the buzz you're
          lookin' for.
A TAXI pulls up.

                    ERICA

          And you know what? Everyday, I'm
          gettin' older. ..just like you.
Erica opens the back door of the Taxi.

                      HARRY

          Wait.
Erica turns.
This is his chance.

                    HARRY

          I just... the truth is... I don't
          know how to be a boyfriend.

                     ERICA

          That's what you have to say after all
          this? You don't know how to be a
          boyfriend.

                    HARRY

          That's not a small thing.
They're both out of words.




                                                           98.











                    ERICA

          Are we done?

                    HARRY

          I don't know.
She nods. He doesn't give. She ducks into the CAB and it
PULLS AWAY. Harry stands on the street, watching her go.

                    HARRY

              (winces)
          Ouch.
He grabs his heart.

                       HARRY

          Oh, God...







HARRY - ON A GURNEY

wheeled through the Emergency Room of Beth Israel Hospital.
This is not the Hamptons. This place is crawling with
patients. Harry's delivered to a Latina Doctor in her
thirties, DR. MARTINEZ. As he's taken off the gurney, he's
immediately hooked up to a heart monitor, given oxygen and an

IV.


                    NURSE

          Came in by cab, 15 minutes of chest
          pain, no nauseau, some shortness of
          breath, was hospitalized a week ago
          with a coronary thrombosis.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Hang a nitro drip.

                    HARRY

          You can't. I took Viagra.

                    DR. MARTIINEZ

          You have been through this before.
          Give him 5 mgs of Metoprolol. You
          h~ving chest pain right now?

                    H


                     ARRY

          No, and the pain I was having was
          sharp, not like before.

                    . DR. MARTINEZ

          That's good. Not like before is we
          like to hear.
              (reads EKG)
          Give him aspirin.




                                                        99.











                      DR. MARTINEZ (CONT'D)

          Based   on what I see so far, your
          heart   is not in distress but I'm
          gonna   do a rapid enzyme test to be
          sure.    What were you doing at the
          onset   of the pain?

                    HARRY

          Having a fight with someone. A woman. Can
          a woman give you chest pain?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Are you kidding? Love hurts, haven't you
          heard?

                    HARRY

          Yeah, but so far, I've only given pain, I
          never got any.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

              (confused at how literal
               he is)
          All right, well you're battin' a thousand
          here. Your enzymes look perfect, your
          EKG is normal and the pain doesn't sound
          like the kind of pain we worry about. I
          think what you experienced was normal
          chest pain associated with stress.

                      HARRY

          Stress?

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          And incase you haven't heard, that can
          give you a heart attack. Mr. Langer, I
          donlt know what you're up to gallivanting
          out and about at this hour, but if you
          were my Dad, I'd make sure you were home,
          in bed, recuperating.

INT. HARRY'S TOWNHOUSE - LATER

Harry slowly climbs up the gorgeous staircase of his
Townhouse. Exhausted, he stops half way up, sits on a step,
takes out his cell.

                    HARRY

          If you were my Dad...
He pulls his glasses out of his pocket, puts them on to dial.
Something feels odd, he takes off his glasses, looks at them,
they're not his -- they're Erica's. He puts them back on and
dials.




                                                         100.











                    ERICA'S VOICE

          Hi. It's Erica. I'm not here so
          leave a message.
He realizes he doesn't know what to say, hangs up, then looks
at her glasses.

                    HARRY

              (grabbing his chest)
          Ouch.

BLACK SCREEN




A LIGHT POPS ON and Erica ENTERS HER BEDROOM, crying. She
flops down on her bed, picks up her phone, grabs her glasses,
puts them on, doesn't realize they're Harry's. She dials.
Voice Mail tells her she has One Message. She sits up,
excited.             J

                     ULIAN'S VOICE

          Erica, Hi, it's Julian. It's about
          8:20, I'm in the restaurant...just
          Wondering if you're...
Erica hangs up, starts crying again. She takes off her
glasses to wipe her eyes when she realizes she's holding
Harry's glasses. Just the sight of them makes her burst into
tears, the kind of tears that have been thirty years in the
making.

ERICA'S COMPUTER KEYBOARD - NIGHT

A tear lands on it. Erica, back in a turtleneck and wearing
Harry's glasses, starts writing at a breakneck pace, all the
while, tears flood her eyes.

MORNING - WAVES BREAKING ON THE SHORE


ERICA

wakes up. As soon as her eyes open, she bursts into tears.
While in the SHOWER, the crying never stops. While she EATS
BREAKFAST, a downpour. Running ON THE BEACH, she's wailing.
Back at the "COMPUTER, she's sobbing as her hands fly over
the keys. An actual boo hoo can be heard.
At NIGHT, laptop in bed, Erica writes, eating a   bagel, wearing
Harry's glasses and a pair of wrinkled pajamas,   FRENCH MUSIC plays
in the BG. At this point, she doesn't eVen" pay   attention to her
tears, just wipes and types when out of nowhere   she receives an
INSTANT MESSAGE from HARRY.
He writes: Do I hear French Music?
Shocked, she sits up, tries to fix her hair.




H














                                                         101.











INT. HARRY'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry sits up in bed, staring at his laptop, wearing Erica's
glasses, a pair of pajamas and a three day growth. A
thermometer is propped in his mouth.
He writes: R U there?
She answers: Yes. Hello.
He writes: How are ya?
She writes: Great... as, she wipes her tears on her sleeve.
 e writes:How's the writing going?
She answers: Pouring out of me now. Go figure.

E

He types: I miss y .. He stops, thinks before sending.
 rica waits on her side. Nothing, is coming over.
Then, on his side, he receives: Actually just running out.
Take care...
Harry deletes the I miss y... and instead writes: U 2.
Erica slides down in her bed, wiped.

INT. HARRY' S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Harry takes out his thermometer. Feels lost. Looks at the
clock. It's 10:00 p.m.

INT. LOWELL'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

Lowell lies in bed in pj's, WATCHING TV, smoking. Harry
arrives at his doorway in his pajamas. Lowell puts out his
cigarette, fans the smoke.

                    HARRY

          Lowell, I'm goin' out.

                    LOWELL

              (confused)
          Okay. Don't forget to put some
          clothes on.

                    HARRY

          I mean, I should go out, shouldn't I?
          Since .when don't I go out? Just cause
          some Emergency Room Doctor tells me to
          stay in bed, doesn't mean I have to turn
          into a monk.




                                                       102.











                    LOWELL

          Is there something you'd like me to
          do for you, Mr. Langer?

                    HARRY

          Well, no, just...well, what are you
          doin'?

                    LOWELL

          Watching Lucy.

                    HARRY

          Would you hate making me something
          to eat?

CLOSE - LUCY AND ETHEL ON TV


REVERSE - HARRY AND LOWELL

lying on top of the covers in Lowell's room, both eating
bowls of pasta, watching TV.

                    HARRY

          Funny women are adorable, don't you
          think?

                    LOWELL

          I never really thought about it.

                    HARRY

          Neither had I, but think about it.
          Funny's a unique thing in a woman. It's
          fun to be around.

                    LOWELL

          There's some reason we've been
          watching these two for 5O years.

                    HARRY

          Exactly. It lasts. We're not
          sittin' here watchin' Mamie Van
          Doren reruns.

                    LOWELL

          No we're not. You feeling okay?

                    HARRY

          I don't think I've slept one night
          since I've been home. Every little
          ache and pain scares the shitout of
          me...can't get a handle on my
          emotional life, don't know what I
          want, don't know if what I felt was
          because I just had a heart attack
          or was real. Plus, I feel needy. I
          never used that word in my life.




                                                       103.











                    HARRY (CONT'D)

          Lowell, have you ever seen me like
          this? Be honest.

                    LOWELL

          Nothing even close.

                    HARRY

          That's right, buddy, I'm a mess.
          And I'm no good at it.
              (realizes something)
          Those are very nice pajamas, by the
          way. Did they used to be mine?

                    LOWELL

          Yes but you gave them to me, you
          said you never wore them.

                    HARRY

          I know. But why would I do that?
          They're so elegant. Nice piping...

                    LOWELL

          Mr. Langer, you're always giving
          away beautiful things.

                    HARRY

          Awwwww... How did I get like this?
              (eyes fluttering shut)
          I'm gonna shut my eyes for a few
          minutes. Keep Lucy on...
Harry nods off and Lowell TURNS OUT THE LIGHT.

EXT. BEACH - THE HAMPTONS - MORNING - MUSIC OVER

Erica and Zoe are taking a walk. Erica, still crying, picks
up a brown stone, explains its meaning to Zoe. Zoe holds the
stone, makes an `awwww' face.Erica nods, then Zoe tosses the
stone in the ocean, fed up with hearing about him already.
Then, Zoe stops Erica, points to something.

MARIN AND HER NEW BOYFRIEND

frolicking on the beach. He's a YOUNG HUNK in a tank top,
shorts, highlighted hair. Erica rolls her eyes.

EXT. BEACH STAIRS - DUSK

Marin rushes down the stairs. Erica sits near the bottom of
the stairs, watching the sunset.

                    MARIN

          Mom, we're going into town...
Erica turns, wiping tears.




                                      104.











          MARIN

Are you crying?
    (joining her)
I didn't know you did that.

          ERICA

Yeah, it's my new thing. I've
gotten abnormally great at it.

          MARIN

    (sitting on the step with
    her)
Is it Harry?

          ERICA

Seems I gotta learn how to do that
love 'em and leave 'em stuff.

          MARIN

Fucking men. You don't care when I
say fuck, do you?

          ERICA

Not really. Sometimes. Not right
now.

          MARIN

So now you get my theory about
love? You gotta self protect. It's
too dangerous.

          ERICA

Marin, that theory... how can I put
this so your feelings won't get
hurt. It's just so crazy, it makes
me want to SCREAMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!

          MARIN

And how would you put it if you
wanted to hurt my feelings?

          ERICA

Listen to me... you cannot hide
from love for the rest of your life
because maybe it won't work out and
maybe you'll become unglued. That's
not a way to live.

          MARIN

So you're telling me you're happy
right now? This is good what
happened to you?




                                                       105.











                    ERICA

          No. This was bad. But for the three days
          it was good, it was electrifying.
Marin's eyes fill up.

                    ERICA

          I think you must consider the possibility
          that we are more alike than you realize.
          I let someone in and I had the time of my
          life.

                    MARIN

              (tearful)
          I've never had the time of my life.

                    ERICA

          I know. And bubbee, I say this from
          the deepest part of my heart. . ...
          what the fuck are you waiting "for?

INT. HARRY'S HOUSE - NYC - NIGHT

A PARTY is in progress. It's loud. The place is crawling with
characters from the Hip Hop world. Harry winds his way down his
crowded STAIRCASE, Girls grabbing at him as he passes by. As hard
as he tries, he can't quite bring to life the guy he knew how to
be.

                    LOWELL

              (as Harry passes)

          H

           aving fun?

                       HARRY

          Not quite.
Harry makes his way down the stairs, through the crowded
entry and OUT THE FRONT DOOR. OUTSIDE, Harry steps into the
QUIET STREET, looks up at his house and the party inside.

EXT. ROADSIDE FARM STAND - EAST HAMPTON - DAY

Zoe is picking corn, when she notices Julian across the way.
He glances up, looks right past her, obviously doesn't
remember her, keeps on shopping. Zoe thinks for a see,
wondering how she can get his attention when he looks right
back at her, his face full of hope.

INT. ERICA'S DINING ROOM - LATER

Erica sets the table for two. Zoe pokes her head in the door.

                    ZOE

          I got you something great at the
          farm stand.




J














                                                       106.










Zoe fully opens the door revealing Julian holding a bouquet
of fresh cut flowers.

                    JULIAN

          These are for you to give me when
          you apologize.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - MUSIC OVER

Candlelit. Zoe, Erica and Julian share a bottle of wine and a
home cooked meal. The CAMERA does a 360 around the table,
their faces saying it all. The Women bask in Julian's warmth
as he entertains them with stories. Zoe looks from Julian to
Erica, relieved to see her sister smiling again.

INT. KITCHEN - LATER

Erica places coffee cups in the sink. Julian is next to her,
leaning against the counter, holding a glass of wine.

                    ERICA

          Julian, I hope you know I'm
          mortified by my behavior. I was
          going to get in touch with you,
          send you a note or something...

                    JULIAN

          A note? That's a little chilly.

                    ERICA

          I'm embarrassed. I just haven't
          been myself lately. What can I say?

                    JULIAN

          Just tell me you're sorry.

                    ERICA

          I am sorry.

                    JULIAN

          Then you could kiss me.

                       ERICA

          Kiss you?
 ulian nods.

                    ERICA

          You'll forgive me if I kiss' you?

                       JULIAN

          Think so.
Erica hesitates then gives him a peck of a kiss.




                                                         107.











                    JULIAN

          No one on earth would forgive you
          for that kiss
              (places his wine glass on
               the counter)
          May I?
Erica nods as Julian takes her in his arms and gives her a
kiss that doesn't quit.

                    JULIAN

              (still holding her,
              whispers)
          I forgive you.
Erica very distinctly begins to hear the BEATING of her own
heart.

                                          DISSOLVE TO:


ERICA'S COMPUTER SCREEN - ANOTHER NIGHT

On it is written: The lights on the Eiffel Tower dim to black
as the music continues to play.
Erica sits back, still wearing Harry's glasses. Finished at
last. She notices an empty Kleenex box on her desk. She
tosses it in a hook shot across the room and it lands right
in the trash can.

INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

Julian sits on the sofa, shoes off, reading the first half of
the play. A fire burns in the fireplace. Erica approaches the
back of the sofa, holding the rest of the pages.

                    JULIAN

          It's the best thing you've ever written.

                    ERICA

          It is?

                    JULIAN

          It's wonderful. It's sweet. It's smart.
          It's funny.
Erica leans oyer the sofa, reading over his shoulder.

                    JULIAN

          How great is it that I'm not
          intimidated by your brilliance?
Erica gives him a small kiss of appreciation.




                                                       108.











                    JULIAN

          Must we go through this every time?
          Come here...
She leans into him and he kisses her fully and sweetly. She
holds onto the sofa for support.

                                                   CUT TO:


A PRETTY GIRL - WHO LOOKS A LOT LIKE MARIN

eating lunch in Orso's, talking non-stop.

                    PRETTY GIRL

          I'm totally excited about this audition.
          It's such a great part. It's supporting
          but she's a really funny character.
          There's this totally hilarious scene
          where she's dating this like chauvinist
          older guy and just as they're about to do
          it, the guy moans and she thinks he's
          just really into her, right? Except he's
          having a heart attack and she's like
          creeped out and her mother, who basically
          despises the guy, rushes in, gives him
          CPR and saves his life.







REVERSE ON HARRY

choking on his lunch.

INT. BROADWAY THEATER - DAY

Auditions are in progress. On stage, AN ACTRESS reads for the

                     A

part of "The Sister".

                     CTRESS

          Look, we're four sophisticated people.
          Why can't we all stay for the weekend?

ON ERICA'S PROFILE

in the audience. She sits in a row by herself, listening.
Harry ENTERS HER FRAME, sitting directly behind her.

                    HARRY

          I need to talk to you.
Erica freezes, horrified. Turns, sees him.

                    HARRY

          Got a minute?




                                                       109.











BACKSTAGE

Erica and Harry stand in front of a BACKDROP OF THE BEACH.

                      HARRY

            So your play's about us?

                      ERICA

            No, it's about me.

                      HARRY

            Am I in it?

                      ERICA

            A guy like you is in it but he's
            not you.

                      HARRY

            What happens to this guy who's
            ..not me?

                      ERICA

            Haven't totally decided. He can
            live or he can die.

                      HARRY

            What are you leaning towards?

                      ERICA

            Death.
                (Harry reacts)
            It's funnier.

                      HARRY

            He dies of a funny heart attack?

                      ERICA

            He's sort of a schmuck who screwed
            around with our heroine, so it
            won't be too sad.

                      HARRY

            Schmucks are people too you know. Death
            doesn't seem a little harsh?

                      ERICA

            I just went where the story took
            me. It's a work of fiction, Harry.
            Really...just stuff I made up.

                      STAGE MANAGER

                (approaching)
            Erica, we're ready to do the
            hospital, 'Do You Take Viagra
            scene... Should we wait for you?




                                                       110.










Erica nods, horrified.

                    HARRY

          So I'm going to be the laughing stock of
          Broadway.

                    ERICA

          Harry, he's not you. He's a version
          of the truth of you. So to speak.

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Sorry to interrupt again but Dave wants
          to know, when Henry says, "I love ya",
          you want that to be 'Ya', not 'You',
          right?

                    ERICA

          Right.
We now HEAR Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose play throughout
the theater. The BEACH backing is 'raised and an EIFFEL TOWER
BACKING is lowered behind them. They both try to ignore the
music, but it's impossible.

                     E


                     RICA

          Well, you look really nice. You
          feeling all right?
As they stand in front of the Eiffel Tower backing, FAKE SNOW
FALLS from above...

                    HARRY

          You know it isn't like I wanted to stop
          seeing you. We could've carried on a fun
          thing for awhile. Why is it you dames
          want all or nothing?

                    ERICA

          I don't know, we're just goofy when it
          comes to love... Look, Harry, if it's all
          right with you, I'd like to be friends

                    HARRY

          I'm not ready to be your friend. How's
          that?

                    ERICA

          Fine. I understand.

                    HARRY

          Anyway, do you actually buy that horse
          shit.. .that men and women can be friends
          once they've had sex?




                                            111.











          ERICA

I'm friends with my ex-husband, but then
again, we didn't just have sex.

          HARRY

We didn't just have sex either.

          ERICA

Then what was it? Love to know.

           HARRY

Can I e-mail it to you when I figure it
out?
     (laughs)
This is perfect. I have given the `Can't
We Be friends' speech for 40 years. I
think I invented the 'Can't We Be
Friends' speech. But you know what,now I
get why they never went for it. You dames
got one thing right. Sometimes sex does
change everything. Call me crazy, but I
just don't see us out on the town, being
pals, having dinner, 'cause I'd bet you
anything, at some point, one of us will
have very unfriend like thoughts about
the other then pass the bread becomes
anything but pass the bread. You get what
I'm saying?

          ERICA

You don't want to be friends.

          HARRY

Not "don't". Can't. Can't be friends.
Doesn't work that way.
    (tries to calm down)
Okay, I'm moving into another phase of
this thing. I'm mad at you.
    (realizes)
It almost feels good.

          ERICA

I think I'm mad at you too.

          HARRY

Excellent. 'Cause I don't like
thinking about you so much and
worrying about how you are and if I
ruined your life or...

          ERICA

-- You've worried about me?

          HARRY

Yes honey, the schmuck who deserves to
die, worries about you.




                                                       112.

                    HARRY(cont'd)
          Sometimes worrying about you feels like a
          full time job.

                    ERICA

          Well, doll, I'm doing fine. So you don't
          have to work that shift anymore.
Again, The Stage Manager...

                    STAGE MANAGER

          Erica, they want you to take a look at
          the costumes for the dancing Henry's.
          These gonna work for you?
Harry and Erica TURN and SEE a CHORUS LINE of BALDING 60 YEAR

OLD MEN IN HOSPITAL GOWNS AND SOCKS.


EXT. THEATER - DAY

Harry FLIES OUT the Stage Door, right into the street, is
almost hit by a motorcycle, doesn't seem to care.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Harry walks briskly through the park, still pissed, his pace
starting to get to him. He spots a bench with a WOMAN JOGGER
at one end. He parks himself at the other end of the bench,
out of breath. Tries H reason with himself.
                     to

                     ARRY

          God is a woman, I know that now. No
          man would punish me like this.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You never change, do you?
Surprised, Harry turns, glances over at the Woman. She drinks
from a water bottle then offers him an easy warm smile. She's
adorable, mid-sixties, short grey hair.

                    HARRY

          Do you know me or are you just talking to
          me as "man" in general, the beast women
          love to hate.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No, no, I know you Harry.

                    HARRY

          Oh. Don't tell me. I dated your daughter.
              (the Woman laughs)
          Right? I broke her heart then she married
          some hard working Joe on the rebound, has
          three great kids. What is so funny?




                                                       113.











                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You dated me and you broke my heart but
          after you I met the right guy. I've been
          married thirty-seven years, have four
          kids, eight grandkids and a ninth on the
          way.
Harry now fully turns in her direction, totally clueless.

                    HARRY

          I dated you. .?
              (the Woman nods)
          Did we. ever...?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          No...we did not.
He looks at her hard but still doesn't remember her.

                    HARRY

          Can you give me hint? A year? A
          decade?

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          The sixties.
              (Harry squints at her)
          You took me to Shea Stadium.

                     HARRY

          To a Mets game?    I must've really
          liked you.

                    WOMAN JOGGER

          You took me to see The Beatles.

                    HARRY

          Oh, God, I really liked you. You're
          Sandra. ..Cook. We did. We saw The
          Beatles together. How the hell have
          you been? What happened to you?

                    SANDRA

          Well, let's see, after we stopped
          going out, I went back to school,
          got my doctorate in marine biology,
          went around the world a few times,
          met the man of my dreams at Oxford,
          married him, we lived in London for
          25 years. I wrote and taught, we
          raised 3 sons and a daughter. I've
          just finished my ninth book and now
          I'm training for my first marathon.
          Now, I must confess, I actually
          remember the very last thing you
          ever said to me.




                                                       114.

                    SANDRA(cont'd)
          You walked me to my door, I was
          tearful and you looked at me with
          those puppy dog eyes and said,
          "Honey, I just don't know how to be
          a boyfriend." Now, tell me, what
          have you been up to since 1964?
OVER Harry's face, we HEAR the SOUND of a SIREN BLARING.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Harry is wheeled through the ER with the gurney. Dr. Martinez
runs along with the gurney.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer... Back so soon.

                    HARRY

          This is it, I'm dyin', I've had 20
          minutes of severe chest pain,
          nausea, shortness of breath, blood
          pressure's gotta be 170 over 100.
              (sticks out his arm)
          Give me the nitrate, I didn't take
          viagra.
              (rips open his shirt)
          Plug me in to the EKG, I need an
          aspirin, I'm taking 2 beta
          blockers, blood thinner, Lipitor,
          Procardia and if I were you, I'd be
          pounding my chest. Ow!

                    MALE NURSE

          You're a doctor, huh?

                    HARRY

          Just a very sick man.

CLOSE - THE PAPER TAPE FROM HARRY'S EKG

Dr. Martinez reads it.

                     DR. MARTINEZ

          Mr. Langer, your diagnosis although
          fascinating, was entirely
          incorrect.

                    HARRY

          That's impossible.

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Your realize a severe anxiety attack can
          masquerade as a heart attack.

                    HARRY

          So I'm nuts? Perfect! The one thing
          I'm not taking pills for.




                                                          115.











                    DR. MARTINEZ

          If you don't want ,to end up in here
          every week, I suggest you do whatever it
          takes to decompress. Try something with
          me, okay?
              (takes his pulse)
          Close your eyes...now give yourself a
          visual image of something that gives you
          a feeling of peace and serenity.

                    HARRY

          I don't know. A hammock...

                    DR. MATINEZ

          Okay, good...what else..?

                    HARRY

          Palm trees...clear blue water...
We hear the SOUND OF LAPPING WATER, SEA GULLS. . . .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Anybody there with you?

                    HARRY

          Yes. Beautiful women...in thongs...

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          (disgusted) Okay. What else do you
          see, feel, taste...

                    HARRY

          A margarita...a Cuban cigar.
          ..miles of soft beach.. .

                    DR. MARTINEZ

          Keep going...you're doing great...
And as Harry keeps listing things, Camera MOVES IN ON HIM as
the STEEL BAND gets LOUDER AND LOUDER.

                                         DISSOLVE TO:


THE WORDS. . .


                    SIX MONTHS LATER


FALLING SNOW FILLS THE FRAME

Boom down to see the THEATER MARQUEE of Erica's play on
Broadway. On the Marquee are raves from critics, "****", and
a banner that brags, "Sold Out!".

C




 AMERA CONTINUES DOWN to street level. Couples walk by,
bundled up against the cold. Harry ENTERS FRAME.




                                                       116.










He looks different. He has a beard and has lost some weight:
And in his eyes, a calm we haven't seen before. He pauses in
front of the theater -- loo~s at the PUBLICITY PHOTOS. He
SEES Henry in his boxer shorts at the refrigerator meeting
"Emily" and her Sister. He sees ANOTHER PHOTO of The Dancing
Henrys kicking up their legs like Rockettes. Then, finally, A
PHOTO of Henry and Emily in bed, both wearing glasses. Harry
OPENS THE DOOR TO THE THEATER, steps inside and listens,
hearing Louis Armstrong's La Vie En Rose, then, the audience
breaks out in LAUGHTER. Harry smiles to himself.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING

The elevator opens. Harry steps out, looks around for an
apartment number, finds it, rings the bell and clears his
throat. The door quickly OPENS and we see MARIN. She looks
relaxed and happy to see him.

                    MARIN

          I couldn't believe you were calling from
          downstairs.
              (hugs him)
          So great to see you.

                    HARRY

          You couldn't look better.

                    MARIN

          Thank you. Come on in.

                    HARRY

          No, no, I just wanted to stop by and say
          hi and tell you I'm sorry if I ever did
          anything to you that wasn't on the up and
          up or...

                    MARIN

          What do you mean? You were great to me.

                    HARRY

          I was?

                    MARIN

          Always.

                    HARRY

          That's refreshing. Good. Well, I don't
          know what you've done to yourself but you
          look absolutely radiant.

                    MARIN

          I'm three months pregnant, that might
          have something to do with it.




                                                       117.











                    HARRY,

          Really? Who's ..the, lucky guy?

                    MARIN

          My husband, hold on, he really wants to
          meet you.
              (calls)
          Danny...
A Solid Citizen of a Guy joins Marin, loosened tie,
glasses...

                    MARIN

          Harry Langer, my husband, Danny Yellin.

                    DANNY

              (shaking Harry's hand)
          I've heard so much about you...

                      HARRY

          I bet.. .

                     DANNY

          Yeah, with Hthe play and all...

                     ARRY

          I'm famous,huh?

                    MARIN

          Just to us. In every interview my
          Mom does, she always says she made
          you up.

                    HARRY

          So the guy in the play, he doesn't
          make it, does he?

                    DANNY

          He basically dies at the end of the
          second act, but it's very funny.
              (as if that's some
              consolation)

                    HARRY

          Was hopin' she'd give me a
          reprieve, but...

                    MARIN

          Yeah, well...

                    HARRY

          Yeah. Okay...Best of luck, kids...
Marin is stumped by this little visit. Harry heads toward the
elevator, pushes the button, then turns back.




                                                          118.











                    HARRY

          How is she?

                     MARIN

          She's. . .
              (Harry waits)
          Really good.     Up to her old
          tricks.
Learning Italian, remodeling her apartment in the city.

                    HARRY

          Now if I wanted to see her...how
          would that go over?

                    MARIN

              (encouragingly)
          Only one way to find out, except
          she's out of town right now.

                    HARRY

          Oh yeah? Where is she?

                    MARIN

          Paris. She left two days ago, for
          her birthday. But she'll be back
          next week...
The Elevator arrives. Harry salutes his goodbye and steps
INSIDE THE ELEVATOR. He turns, FACES CAMERA.

                       HARRY

          Paris...

ANOTHER ELEVATOR.OPENS

And a clean shaven, dapper looking Harry steps off, cashmere
coat, gorgeous scarf. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM out of the elevator
and through a BEAUTIFUL LOBBY OF A HOTEL then right onto THE
STREET. CAMERA does a 360 and we catch glimpses of PARIS AT
NIGHT. CAMERA SETTLES ON HARRY just as the LIGHTS OF THE
EIFFEL TOWER POP ON, sending a flood of golden lights high
into the night sky directly behind him.

                       HARRY

          Showtirne.

INT. LEFT BANK BISTRO - NIGHT

Erica sits alone at a table in the back of the room, drinking
a glass of wine. She looks vibrant. She glances up from her
drink and sees what looks like Harry making his way around
the tables. She leans to the side for a better look, to make
sure it's him. It is him and he's corning right toward her.
Her stomach sinks, her mind races... and before she can come
up with a single thought that makes any sense -- there he is.




                                                       119.











                    HARRY

              (proud of himself)
          I knew you'd be here.

                      ERICA

          You did?

                    HARRY

          I've come a long way to see you,
          Erica.

                    ERICA

          You mean we're not bumping into
          each other..? You came here to see
          me?

                    HARRY

          Yes, I did.
              (she seems to shiver)
          I'm aware it was a bold move, one
          of those impulses that grabs you,'
          but...so far, we're okay; right?

                    ERICA

          Well, uh, I mean, I'm just...

                    HARRY

          I'll take that as a 'Yes'.
Harry takes off his coat and scarf, hangs them on a hook.

                     ERICA

          You want a glass of wine or
          something?

                    HARRY

          I was just gonna give you a kiss
          hello.

                      ERICA

          Oh, Okay.
Neither is sure where to go. Cheek? Lips? He lands on her
chin. .Not what he wanted, but he takes a seat across from
her. She looks at him - utterly speechless.

                    HARRY

          I remember you said if we still
          know each other we should go to
          Paris for our birthdays, well, we
          still know each other..".

                    ERICA

          That's true, but, Harry, I haven't
          heard from you in six months.




                                                         120.











                    HARRY

          I know but I've certainly been thinking
          about you. There's a lot I have to say.
          First thing is... I'm not mad at you
          anymore.

                    ERICA

          Good, 'cause I'm not mad at you
          anymore either.

                    HARRY

          That's a relief...since I did come all
          the way to France and everything. And...
          Happy Birthday.

                     ERICA

              (afraid of everything he
              could possibly say)
          Thank you.

                     HARRY

          And congratulations on your amazing
          success...

                    ERICA

          It's been quite a ride. Funny, I thought
          maybe I'd hear from you when it opened.
          Where've you been?

                    HARRY

          After I saw you in the theater that
          afternoon, I had another "episode...

                    ERICA

          Oh, I'm sorry.

                    HARRY

          I was actually okay, but I was sure I was
          dying and the doctor in the ER said I needed
          to decompress. So I did. I walked out of
          there and changed my life, sold most of my
          businesses, packed my bags and moved to an
          island in the Caribbean.

                    E


                     RICA

          That's where you've been all this
          time? In the Caribbean?

                    HARRY

          Actually...No.







EXT. CARIBBEAN BEACH - FLASHBACK

Harry lies on a chaise under a palm tree, drink in hand, Hawaiian
shirt, shades. A steel drum plays in the distance.




                                                          121.











                    ,


                    HARRY (V.O.

          I was there about ,six hours, when it
          occurred to me that wasting away on an
          island in the Caribbean wasn't going to
          remotely cure what was ailing me.
Harry sits straight up into CAMERA.

BLACK SCREEN

A LIGHT POPS ON and we realize we are in HARRY'S CLOSET.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          So I decided to take another kind of
          pilgrimage...into my past.
Harry ENTERS THE CLOSET, reaches onto a top shelf ,and starts
pulling down dozens of what used be called, "Little Black Books".

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My thought was -- if I retraced my steps
          and visited all the women I've dated...
He blows dust off of the books.

                                         BACK IN PARIS


                    HARRY

          -- maybe I could figure out how I
          got so screwed up.

FLASHBACK - HARRY'S PILGRIMAGE

Harry STANDS at one FRONT DOOR after the NEXT, EACH ONE

SLAMMING IN HIS FACE.


                    HARRY (V.O.)

          A lot of the women wouldn't see me.
Then, we see WOMEN of various ages SLAP HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Or speak to me.
Harry reels backwards from one Hefty Mama.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          But I was on a mission to save my
          soul.

                     ,

A Woman In Her Fifties, purposively walks down a SMALL TOWN
MAIN STREET carrying groceries.




                                                          122.










Harry, at her side, keeps talking at her, even though she
picks up her pace and ignores him.

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          My losing streak finally ended when
          I got one to open up to me.
In a HOSPITAL ROOM, an Older Woman on life support, scrawls
out a note and shows it to Harry who sits in a chair by
herside. A Priest stands in the background. The note says,
"As I remember it, you were wildly insensitive". Harry lowers
his head in shame. She places another note in front of him.
It says, "I forgive you." Relieved, he smiles. Then, one last
note: "Now, scram."

                    HARRY (V.O.)

          Hearing what they had to say was no
          picnic.
In an Upper West Side COFFEE SHOP, Harry pas coffee
with a Woman in her Mid Forties. She talks his ear off.
Harry can' t deal with it. He looks away ~ The woman
places her hand on his chin and pulls him right back to
her and keeps talking at him.

                     H


                     ARRY (V .O.)

          But I stuck it out and I listened.
          Then I listened harder.
Harry WALKS down THE STREET with a ANOTHER WOMAN in her
Thirties, who carries a cello.   She never shuts up.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          And one of the things I realized
          was, I was actually giving closure
          to generations of women.
At the corner, the Woman hugs Harry goodbye.

                    HARRY (V. O. )

          Although I admit, some refused to
          give, no matter what I did. . .

CLOSE - DIANE SAWYER

On the set of GOOD MORNING AMERICA. She glances out the
STUDIO WINDOW and sees Harry ON THE STREET among the folks
holding signs. He HOLDS A SIGN that says, "DIANE, YOU WERE
RIGHT.   I WAS ENTIRELY WRONG.   I`M SORRY."   She looks him
straight in the eye and gives 'him the finger.




                                                       123.











HARRY - FULLY DRESSED - LYING ON HIS BED - TOP SHOT


                    HARRY (V. O. )

          When you hear the same story about
          yourself over and over, your life
          begins to make sense and the future
          becomes your only salvation.







INT. PARIS BISTRO - THE PRESENT


                    HARRY

          It took me six months to find them
          all. I visited 18 different states
          but I came the furthest to see you.
A HAND lands on his shoulder and he HEARS:

                    A MAN'S VOICE

          I don't believe it.
Harry looks up and sees handsome young Julian in a beret.
Harry looks to Erica, instantly deflated..

                       HARRY

          Me either.
Harry stands. The two Men hug, then Julian squeezes in next
to Erica. Harry slowly takes his seat across from them.

                    ERICA

          I should have told you he was coming, but
          I was so engrossed in your story.

                    JULIAN

          What story..?

                     HARRY

          Oh, maybe another time. ..So...
              (looks from Erica to
               Julian, it all dawns on
               him)
          I guess I should've seen your play, then
          I would've Jknown how this ended.

                     ULIAN

          Yeah, big twist, huh? So what are
          you doing over here, man?

                    HARRY

          Just a uh, vacation...never been to Paris
          in January...

                     JULIAN

          It's amazing to run into you. You look
          wonderful.




                                                          124.











                    ERICA

          You do.

                    HARRY

          Haven't been on a gurney in six months so
          that's somethin'...

                    JULIAN

          Well, I've just been to every store
          in the city, this woman is
          impossible to buy for... But I
          think I finally found the right
          gift.
He puts what can only be a RING BOX on the table between
Erica and Harry.

                    JULIAN

          Happy Birthday baby.
He kisses her. Harry watches, dying.

                    ERICA

              (reaching for it)
          I'll open it later...
Harry rises, reaches for his coat.

                    HARRY

          No, no, you know what, I'll let you
          two celebrate...

                    ERICA

          Harry, stay.

                    HARRY

          I can't really.

                    JULIAN

          Why? You have somewhere to go?

                                           DISSOLVE TO:


THE WAITER POURING THE END OF A WINE BOTTLE

Everyone at the table is laughing, mid-meal. Julian is doing
the talking as well as laughing. Harry laughs along, trying
to be an approving part of their romance but he's totally
faking it.

THREE GLASSES OF BRANDY ARE SERVED - A LITTLE LATER


                    JULIAN

          -- To the forces of destiny that
          brought us together tonight.




                                                       125.










Erica lights a cigarette.

                    JULIAN

          What are you doing, you don't
          smoke?

                    ERICA

          I'm in Paris, the second hand smoke
          will kill you anyway...

                    JULIAN

          She's very brilliant, but the woman
          can not hold her liquor.
Julian puts his arm around her, pulls her close.

                    ERICA

          I like that about me.

                    BOTH GUYS

          Me too.
The Guys exchange looks.

                    ERICA

          Now, if I were writing this, this
          is where I'd write, 'an awkward
          moment' .

                    HARRY

          Honey, if you were writing this,
          I'd be dead.
Erica laughs.

                    HARRY

          Never fails to amuse her.
The Waiter drops the check on the table. Harry takes it.

                    JULIAN

          No, Harry, please, let us...

                    HARRY

          No, no, I insist. I crashed your
          party.
              (to Erica)
          At least let me buy you dinner on
          your birthday...
              (squints at his watch
               shows it to Erica)
          What time does that say?

                    ERICA

              (squints)
          I have no idea...




                                                       126.











                    HARRY

              (feels around)
          Wait,' I have my. . .

                    ERICA

              (reaching into her purse)
          Me too...
They each take out EACH OTHER'S GLASSES and put them on.
Erica points to Harry wearing her glasses and laughs.

                    HARRY

          You think you look so handsome in
          mine?

                     ERICA

          You know how long I've been looking
          for those?

                      HARRY

          Yes I do.
Harry hands Erica her glasses. She hesitates. He snaps,
gesturing for his to be turned over. She hands them to him.
Julian watches all this, sobered by their chemistry.

                     H


                     ARRY

              (tucking away his glasses)
          Once again...closure.
              (reads his watch)
          So it's only 5 in the afternoon in
          New York. What do they do around
          here for fun?







INT. NOISY CLUB - NIGHT

Camera finds the three of them sitting at a small table. The
place is dark, loud, crowded and young. They're all drinking
champagne. The air is strained.

                    BOTH GUYS

              (at the same time)
          Want to dance?
Harry gestures for Julian to have the first dance. Julian
takes Erica's hand and leads her to the dance floor. Harry
watches them slip through the crowd. Erica turns back, Harry
waves. Julian takes Erica in his arms, it's clear she's
comfortable in his embrace. None of .this is lost on Harry
and as he watches, the smile on his face more than fades, it
evaporates and everything inside him begins to hurt.

ANGLE - THE DANCE FLOOR

Erica and Julian -- they're sexy together.




                                                       127.











ANGLE - THE TABLE

Harry is gone.

EXT. STREET - PARIS - NIGHT

Harry, with his collar turned up against the cold, walks past
the glass pyramid in front of The Louvre.

EXT. PONT NEUF - PARIS - MOMENTS LATER

Harry walks over the bridge, the beauty surrounding him just
making it all worse. He stops, looks out at the Seine. He
hears a classic French song in the distance, then sees a
small barge, playing the music, pass beneath him. Without
warning, a tear falls from his eye.

                    HARRY

              (laughs at himself)
          At the end of the day, I'm nothin'
          but a sap, a stupid old sap,
          standing on a bridge in Paris,
          crying my eyes out.
He stops, looks at the mighty city surrounding him. Beauty's
not supposed to hurt. Another tear.

                    HARRY

              (almost amused)
          Look who gets to be the girl.
He wipes his eyes on his coat sleeve as SNOW begins to fall.

                    HARRY

              (looking toward heaven)
          Anything else... .

                      ERICA'S VOICE

          Harry?
Harry turns and sees Erica standing by a Cab with its motor
running, snow falling on her hair and coat.

                    HARRY

          Where's Julian?

                    ERICA

          He went back to the hotel.

                      HARRY

          How come?




                                                       128.











                    ERICA

              (walking to him)
          He said when he saw me with you, he
          knew I was still in love with you.
          What do you have to say about that?

                    HARRY

          If it's true, my life just got
          made.

                    ERICA

          Why'd you come here, Harry?

                    HARRY

          Because I realized what I was feeling for
          you, have always felt for you, was
          something I didn't understand, like a
          language I didn't speak...
              (she listens...)
          It scared me so I did what I do. I snuck
          away. Turns out the heart attack was easy
          to get over. You were somethin' else.
              (she's starting to melt)
          And when I went to see all those women, I
          found out I was never really present for
          any of them. And something inside me at
          some point, had just...shut off. That's
          when I think my heart gave out and you
          saved me. I finally get what it's all
          about. I'm 63 years old and I am in love
          for the first time in my life. And that's
          what I came here to say.

                    ERICA

          Okay, this is the best birthday ever.

                     HARRY

          I know I'm no spring chicken, I figure I
          only got another 30-40 years in me. Tops.
          But how 'bout we figure out a way to make
          this work.

                    ERICA

          Okay.

                    HARRY

          Okay? Okay! I'll take it.
The Barge drifts back under the bridge, La Vie En Rose piping
out of it's tinny speakers.

                    HARRY

          Honey, they're playing our song.




                                                         129.










She comes close and he pulls her in, kissing her great. And
as they separate, he smiles, relieved.

INT. CHIC EATERY - NYC - A HOT AUGUST NIGHT

The same restaurant from the first scene of the film - One
Year Later. Harry ENTERS FRAME, just like he did before.

           Langer, party of four.. .and a
           half.
The Maitre'D snaps to attention and leads Harry, Erica,
Marin, holding her Baby Girl, and her husband Danny through
the crowded restaurant. The Baby fusses and reaches out to
Harry who takes her in his arms and proudly parades her
through this swanky crowd to a round table in the center of
the room. Harry beams at the prize in his arms as he sits
with his family for a Sunday dinner.

        FADE IN:

        Very happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in.

        PAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town
        nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South
        Park.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as
        they walk by.

        It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off
        from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.

        A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He
        is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes
        and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.

                             STAN
                   I'm going to the movies
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movie
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget all my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how I should view the world
                   Where everything works out
                   I love it that way
                   I'm going to the movies
                   The movies today!

        Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.

        INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

        We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
        off. BRRRRRTTT!!!

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER
                   Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
                   a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
                   and water the cows!!

        From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
        bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.

        We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
        closet and pulls out an orange coat.

        The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
        hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.

                             MOTHER (O.S.)
                   KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!

        This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
        no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
        hazel eyes.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

        INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

        Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
        kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
        sitting at the humble table.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Sit down, you can share some of your
                   brother's waffle.

        The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.

        EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

        Kenny opens the door to find Stan.

                             STAN
                   Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
                   out! You wanna come?!

        Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
        Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
        light up.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm, rmph!

        Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Kenny! Where're you going?

                             KENNY
                   Mph mprh mprh rm!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   What do you mean you don't want to go to
                   church?

                             KENNY
                   Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.

        Kenny and Stan walk down the street.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
                   then when you die and go to hell you can
                   ANSWER TO SATAN!!

        Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
        then walks off with Stan anyway.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
        happy beat.

        TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
        Rhinoplasty office.

                             TOM
                   Say, where are you boys going?

                             STAN
                   We're going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   Where everyone is beautiful
                   And have their hair combed just
                   right!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
                   Mph rm rmph rm!
                   Mprh rm rmph rm rm

                             TOM
                   Have fun you rascals!

        EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

        Kenny and Stan knock at the door.

        A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.

                             KYLE
                   Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
                   to church, Kenny?

                             STAN
                   Kyle, check it out.

        Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.

                             KYLE
                   OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!

        Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
        Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
        boy bounces up next to him.

                             KYLE
                   No, Ike! You can't come with me!

        Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Kyle, you take your little brother out to
                   play with you!

                             KYLE
                   Aw, ma!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Do as I say, Kyle!

        Kyle's mother closes the door.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it!!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
        street and sing in unison.

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies
                   To see the better side of life
                   Where something interesting happens
                   Every day and night!

                             KYLE
                   In movies we can pretend
                   That love is real
                   and good always wins-

                             STAN
                   We can even make believe marriages
                   last!

        A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?

        Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
        suddenly jumps up.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   I'm going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movies
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how to view the world!

                             KYLE
                   Let's go get fat ass!

        EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY

        This house looks just like all the others.

        INT. THAT SAME HOUSE

        CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
        into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
        them --

        BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
        who chows down on the chips.

        Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
        eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.

        The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.

                             CARTMAN
                   MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!

        CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
        (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
        with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Look, Eric it's your little friends.

                             CARTMAN
                   What the hell are you guys doing here?

                             IKE
                   Baba turtre bad!

        Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ooh!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

        Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
        singing.

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies
                   To see the better side of life!

                             CARTMAN
                   Maybe there'll be pirates!
                   Or a whole city burnin'!
                   Maybe we'll see a monster
                   Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies!
                   Everything's gonna be okay!

        The boys skip out of frame.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
        Park buildings.

        The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.

                             BOYS
                   Going to the movies!
                   The movies today!!!!!

                             STAN
                   Can I get five tickets to Terrance and
                   Phillip Asses of Fire, please?

                             TICKET GUY
                   No.

        Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
        comes to an ABRUPT HALT.

        The boys look confused.

                             KYLE
                   What'dya mean, no?

                             TICKET GUY
                   Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is
                   rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.

        The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.

                             CARTMAN
                   The hell we can't! My money is just as
                   good as any white person's!

                             TICKET GUY
                   You have to be accompanied by a parent or
                   guardian.

                             KYLE
                   But why?

                             TICKET GUY
                   Because this movie has naughty language,
                   and it might make you kids start using
                   bad words.

                             CARTMAN
                   Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't
                   let us in to see this movie I'm gonna
                   kick you square in the nuts.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Sorry, Charlie.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it!

                             TICKET GUY
                   Next, please?

        A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step
        aside.

                             STAN
                   This is terrible! This can't be
                   happening!!

                             KYLE
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude!

                             CARTMAN
                   Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that
                   good anyway.

                             KYLE
                   Cartman! What the hell are you talking
                   about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it
                   probably can't sustain itself over ninety
                   minutes.

                             IKE
                   Poo baba!

                             STAN
                   Wait! I've got an idea!

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER

        The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
        Ticket Guy with the boys.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance
                   and Phillip Asses of Fire.

                             TICKET GUY
                   You realize this movie is rated R? It may
                   not be appropriate for your little ones.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Oh.
                       (Turning to boys)
                   Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate
                   for you.

                             STAN
                       (Whispering)
                   Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to
                   buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten
                   bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of
                   Vodka and not forget about how miserable
                   your life is and not stop the voices in
                   your head then go right ahead.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Five tickets please.

        The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.

        INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

        The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge
        tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.

                             IKE
                   Purpre mama!

                             KYLE
                   Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!

        ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN

        A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'

                             BOYS
                   HOORAY!!!

        On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome
        Canadian star with a great body.

                             PHILLIP
                   Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest
                   say to the Uranian gynecologist?

        PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
        handsome in a more rugged way.

                             TERRANCE
                   I don't know, Phillip, what?

        Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        ANGLE - BOYS

        Laughing their asses off.

                             KYLE
                   That was sweet!

                             STAN
                   Where do they come up with this stuff?!

                             CARTMAN
                   How come Terrance and Phillip are so
                   weird looking?

                             KYLE
                   Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like
                   Ike!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh.

                             IKE
                   Poo bada!

        ANGLE - SCREEN

                             TERRANCE
                   You're such a pigfucker, Phillip!

                             PHILLIP
                   What?! Why would you call me a
                   pigfucker?!

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck
                   pigs.

                             PHILLIP
                   Oh yeah!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        ANGLE - BOYS

                             KYLE
                   Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they
                   said?

        ANGLE - SCREEN

        Terrance pulls out a white envelope.

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I
                   just got a letter!

                             PHILLIP
                   A letter from who, you shit sucking cock
                   master?

        TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
        the film enters their innocent ears.

                             TERRANCE
                   It's from your mother.

                             PHILLIP
                   My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it
                   say?

                             TERRANCE
                   It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever
                   tell my son that I licked your hairy
                   balls.'

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                             PHILLIP
                   Oh, you fucking ball whore!

        The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
        taking it all in.

                             CARTMAN
                   Wow... Ball whore...

        The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide
        smiles.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!

                             TICKET GUY
                   I knew it! You PAID a homeless guy to get
                   you in, didn't you!

        The boys think a second.

                             CARTMAN
                   Suck my balls.

                             KYLE

        The boys walk away, merrily. The ticket guy is in shock.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Oh oh, I'm in trouble.

                             BOYS

        EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

        All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for
        ice skating.

        The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
        Charlie Brown Christmas special.

        Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
        joyous music plays.

        The boys walk up to the pond.

                             CLYDE
                   Hey, where have you guys been all day?

        All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.

                             BEBE
                   You saw it?!

                             CLYDE
                   How'd you get in?!

        Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're
        like celebrities.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced
                   cockmasters!

        All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the
        voice of God.

                             KIDS
                   Wowwww...

                             STAN
                   Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming
                   unclefuckers.

                             KIDS
                   Ooooohhh!!!

                             CLYDE
                        (To another kid)
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude.

        The other kids nod.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
                   called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
                   wart! Stan? Stan?

        But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
        gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.

        The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
        around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
        Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.

        All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
        stop to admire her.

        Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
        he's looking at.

                             STAN
                   Thank my lucky stars
                   Here before me now
                   Is everything I'd ever hoped for
                   Knew it in a word
                   Saw it in a glance
                   The only thing I think I'd die
                   for...

                             KYLE
                   Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
                   fucking song again.

        ANGLE - WENDY

        Spinning and soaring in slo-mo.  Effortlessly covering every
        inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.

        Stan is slack-jawed.

                             STAN
                   I can't stop now
                   My heart's awake
                   I pray her arms
                   my arms to take
                   So this is why I'm ali-

        Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
        landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
        and abruptly ending his song.

                             WENDY
                   Hi, Stan!

        Stan vomits profusely all over himself.

                             WENDY
                   Ew! Gross!

        Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
        face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
        year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
        speaks with a rich English accent.

                             GREGORY
                   Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
                   brush.

        Stan looks at Gregory.

                             STAN
                   Who are you, kid?

                             GREGORY
                   My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
                   counter-cousin for some time.

                             WENDY
                   Want to skate with us?

                             GREGORY
                   We've been skating all morning. And
                   laughing and talking of memories past.

        Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
        get Wendy's attention.

                             STAN
                   We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                             WENDY
                   That's nice, Stan.

        Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.

                             KYLE
                   Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
                   guy?

                             STAN
                   She's not my girlfriend, dude!

        Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
        Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
                   movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said,
                   "Who wants to touch me?!"

        A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
        arm.

                             SMALL BOY
                   Oooooh...

        EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING

        Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
        consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.

        It's a brand new day.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
        mountain peaks.

        INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.

                             KIDS
                   Shut your fucking face,
                   Unclefucka!!
                   You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
                   Unclefucka!!

        The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.

        CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
        be speaking.

                             MR. HAT
                   Okay, children, let's take our seats.

        As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
        puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
        old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.

                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
                   We have a lot to learn and precious
                   little time.

        Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
        one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
        except, of course, for Wendy.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
                   Sigfried and Roy?

                             KYLE
                   It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
                   it's Terrance and Phillip.

                             KIDS
                   TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!

        Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
        sulks.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Well, anyway... Today children, our
                   friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
                   about the environment.

                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
                   That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
                   environment is what surrounds us. It is
                   what we live and breathe.

                             CARTMAN
                   I hate the environment.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, how can you hate the environment?

                             CARTMAN
                   'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
                   fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

        The kids all GASP!

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?

                             CARTMAN
                   Fragile?

                             KYLE
                   No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You
                   can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Kyle!

                             CARTMAN
                   Why the fuck not?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Eric!

                             STAN
                   Dude, you just said fuck again.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Stanly!

                             KENNY
                   Mph.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Kenny!

                             CARTMAN
                   That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
                   can say something, I should be able to
                   say it too!

                             BEBE
                   Wow, Cartman's cool!

                             CLYDE
                   He's like Terrance and Phillip!

        Cartman gloats proudly.

                             CARTMAN
                   Fuckin' a right.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   How would you like to go to the
                   principal's office?

                             CARTMAN
                   How would you like to gargle rat jiz?

        Mr. Garrison is in shock.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

                             CARTMAN
                   I said -

        Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
        to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.

                             CARTMAN
                        (Through megaphone)
                   HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!

        Garrison is floored.

                             KYLE
                   Oh, dude we are fucked now.

        INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

        The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.

                             STAN
                   Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw
                   the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

        Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
        a frizzy haired woman of about forty.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   I am VERY disappointed in you boys!
                   You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've
                   already called in your parents, but first
                   I want you to THINK about what you've
                   done.

                              CARTMAN
                   Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?

                             PRINCPAL VICTORIA
                   What?

                             CARTMAN
                   What's the big fucking deal?

                             STAN
                   Yeah.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   AGH!! I want to know where you heard
                   these horrific obscenities!

        The boys look at each other.

                             STAN
                   Nowhere.

                             KYLE
                   I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
                   times before...

                             STAN
                   Yeah!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
                   ever said-
                        (Reading)
                   'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
                   spelunker' in school!

        The boys all laugh.

        But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
        mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.

                             STAN
                   Oh, oh...

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Thank you all for coming on such short
                   notice. As you can see, your boys are all
                   being disciplined.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   This just isn't like you, Stanley!

        Stan looks down at the floor.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
                   Did he say the S word?

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   No, it was worse than that...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (Gasping)
                   The F word?!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   No, worse. Here's a short list of the
                   things they've been saying.

        The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
        eyes bulge.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh dear God...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What is 'fisting'?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   That's when the fist is inserted into the
                   anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.

        The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   What?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (To Kyle)
                   Young man, you will tell Peincipal
                   Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all
                   these horrible phrases!

                             KYLE
                   I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath,
                   and swore ourselves to secrecy!

                             CARTMAN
                   It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

                             STAN
                   Dude!

                             CARTMAN
                   What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of
                   here.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt!
                   Not again!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   What is Terrance and Phillip?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
                   untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.
                   Their TV show is filled with toilet humor
                   and bad language and is just complete
                   garbage.  Now it appears they have a
                   movie and I'm positive it's not suitable
                   for children!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Well, it looks like I'll have to send a
                   warning letter out to parents. I have to
                   put a stop to this before MORE children
                   see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

                             CARTMAN
                   Everybody's already fucking seen it.

                             MS. CARTMAN
                   Eric!

                             CARTMAN
                   I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie
                   has warped my fragile little mind.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and
                   let us adults speak.

        The boys get up and walk out. Kyle's mother slams the door
        behind them.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We must take action on this immediately.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give
                   detention to those boys.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Forgive me for saying so, Principal
                   Victoria, but your methods are too...
                   Shall we say... soft?  As head of the
                   PTA, I am exercising my right under
                   article 42 of the PTA code.

        A look of shock comes over the principal's face.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Article 42!  You don't mean-?!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is
                   impeaching you.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   But I-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   You are officially relieved of your
                   duties as principal of this school!

        Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Get out of that chair! The PTA is in
                   charge now!

        INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

        The other school kids are in line for lunch.

        Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through
        the P.A.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Attention students. We are now enforcing
                   a new dress code at South Park
                   Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts
                   are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone
                   wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is
                   to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.

        The kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip
        shirts.

                             KIDS
                   HOOORAY!!!

        The kids all cheer and run out the door. Leaving the
        cafeteria absolutely empty... Except for Wendy.

                             WENDY
                   Hello?

        Wendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building.

                   the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip
                   Asses of Fire'. Here with a special
                   report, is a quadriplegic midget in a

        INT. SPELLING BEE - DAY

        A QUADRIPLEGIC MIDGET IN A BIKINI stands in front of the
        camera with a microphone.

                             Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
                   Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects
                   of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching
                   indeed. All over America, children seem
                   to be influenced.

         A TEACHER is on stage with a young spelling bee contestant.

                             TEACHER
                   Alright, this is for the silver medal.

                   Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have
                   to spell forensics?

        All the kids cheer.

        EXT. BIRTHDAY PARTY - DAY

        A happy birthday party is going on is some kids backyard. A
        clown is entertaining everyone.

                             CLOWN
                   Hey kids, how would you like to see some
                   magic tricks?!

                             KIDS
                   FUCK YOU!!

        The clown looks startled.

                             CLOWN
                   Huh?

                             CHILD
                   Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red
                   nose.

                             CHILD 2
                   Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck
                   your gay pants.

        PAN OVER to again find the midget reporter. He now has a
        graphic of a record chart next to him.

                             Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
                   And the devastating impact of the
                   Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and
                   Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your
                   Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has
                   climbed the charts with a bullet --

        We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka."

        The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and
        Puffy in that video they did in Vegas.  They wear shiny
        bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish-eye lens of the
        camera.

                             TERRANCE & PHILLIP
                        (Singing)
                   Shut your fucking face!
                   Unclefucka!!

        The news anchor shakes his head in disgust.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The
                   controversy surrounding the Terrance and
                   Phillip movie began in the small mountain
                   town of South Park, Colorado where the
                   local PTA banned the movie.  With us
                   tonight is the head of the South Park
                   PTA, Sheila Brofloski-

        A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The
        TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing
                   this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or
                   is it Canada?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Canada!

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the
                   Canadian Minister of Movies.

        A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a
        goofy looking Canadian slides into the other.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Thank you, Minister, for joining us.

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Thanks for having me, buddy.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Minister, parents all over America are
                   concerned about your country's
                   entertainment. Your thoughts?

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Well, the film is R rated, and it's not
                   intended for children-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh but OF COURSE children are going to
                   see it!!

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The
                   fact is that we Canadians are quite
                   surprised by your outrage-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   YOU JUST DON'T CARE!

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The
                   United States has graphic images of
                   violence on television all the time, what
                   is that one show? COPS? And car crashes
                   caught on tape? We can't believe that a
                   movie with some foul language and fart
                   jokes would piss you off so much.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ...
                   ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.

                   But minister, it isn't like this film is
                   the first troublesome thing to come out
                   of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams
                   a few decades ago.

        The Minister thinks.

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   What?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   The Canadians are just mad that we
                   mothers here in South Park have the
                   chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or
                   not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children
                   are now safe from your Canadian smut!

        INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching
        the Terrance and Phillip movie.

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, Terrance I hope you learned
                   something from this whole experience.

                             PHILLIP
                   I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a
                   boner biting dick fart fuck face!

        The boys laugh merrily. Wendy just looks bored.

                             TERRANCE
                   Say Phillip, want to see the Northern
                   Lights?

                             PHILLIP
                   You bet, Terrance!

        Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts.

        The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass.

                             PHILLIP
                   HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by
                   lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!

                             TERRANCE
                        (Just a skull)
                   I sure did, Phillip!!

        The boys laugh hysterically.

                             STAN
                   Did you see that, Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Yup.

        EXT. THEATER - DAY

        The boys walk out happily.

                             KYLE
                   Man, that movie gets better every time I
                   see it!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah, but you know what? That whole part
                   about lighting farts is bullshit. You
                   can't do that.

                             STAN
                   Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Stan... I think you and I need some time
                   apart.

                             STAN
                   WHAT?!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh shit.

                             WENDY
                   It's just... It's obvious that we don't
                   have a whole lot in common anymore. I
                   need somebody who's... a little deeper.

                             STAN
                   But Wendy, I can go-

        Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth.

                             WENDY
                   No. Don't speak. You'll only make things
                   more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.

        And just like that, Wendy is gone. Stan looks almost ready to
        cry.

        Kyle walks up behind Stan.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance
                   and Phillip is funny can fuck off
                   anyways.

                             STAN
                        (Insincere)
                   Yeah...

        The boys walk off.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!!

                             CARTMAN
                   No you can't Kenny!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rm rmph!!

                             CARTMAN
                   Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED
                   DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!

                             KENNY
                   Mph mm!

        Kenny pulls out a book of matches.

        He strikes a match and holds it under his ass.

        After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame.

        Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive.

                             KENNY
                   MMMPMMPH!!! MGMFEODFO!!!

        Kenny runs around, and finally falls to the ground, still
        burning.

                             STAN
                   OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!

                             KYLE
                   YOU BASTARD!!

        Cartman looks shocked.

                             CARTMAN
                   Wow, I guess you CAN do that!

        INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

        DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room
        ER style.

        Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway.

                             NURSE
                   CBC chem kit STAT!!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM
                   PENTOTHAL!!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM

        It's mid-operation.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum!

        Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves
        into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Try to untangle his trachea and
                   esophagus!

                             NURSE
                   Right!

        While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso,
        the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his
        windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside
        out in the process.

        Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor
        and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!

                             NURSE
                   Watch his liver!!!

        Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the
        floor.

                             ASSISTANT
                   I'll get it!!!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   We have precious little time left people!
                   We're going to lose him soon!!

        Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

                             NURSE
                   Doctor, his heart's stopped!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Crack him.  Let's get it out of there!!!

        Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   We need to zap this, quick!

        And runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Who's making a potato?

                             DOCTOR 2
                   My bad, sir.  I missed lunch.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this
                   kid!!!!!!

        INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

        Fade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little
        eyes start to open.

        Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are
        there.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me?

        Kenny stirs.

                             KENNY
                        (Weakly)
                   Mph rmph rm...

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   How are you feeling, son?

                             KENNY
                   mph.... rmph....

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Great... Son, I have some bad news.  We
                   accidentally replaced your heart with a
                   baked potato.  You have about seven
                   seconds to live.

                             KENNY
                   Mrm?!

        Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering
        gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the
        outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle.

                             STAN
                   Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!

                             KYLE
                   You bastards!!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Damn it!  It never gets any easier!
                   Anybody get the score of that Broncos
                   game?

        INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

        Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents.

        The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression.

                             NURSE
                   I'm sorry...

        Kenny's mother breaks down.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

                             KENNY'S DAD
                   You bastards!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I knew this would happen! Those bastard
                   Canadians have now killed a child! Can't
                   people see the damage that film is
                   doing?!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   He was killed doing something he saw in
                   the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip...
                   THEY killed Kenny.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   You bastards.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This is it! The time for action is NOW!!
                        (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   This is like a spreading rash!
                   They're pulling out our children's
                   brains
                   and filling them with trash!
                   Can't you see what this is leading
                   to?
                   A world of smut and sex and poo!
                   I believe the good fight has begun!
                   Something must be done!

        Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   I agree!
                        (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   We must take action fast!
                   My child used to say 'please and
                   thank you'
                   Now he says suck my ass!

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   And my boy was the sweetest boy the
                   world had ever known!
                   until those damn Canadians brought
                   that filth into our home!
                   I agree that there is now a battle
                   to be won!
                   We can't just stand here singing!
                   Something must be done!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   But what are we going to do against the
                   media machine? It's so big and powerful!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Right! And we can use that same media
                   machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got
                   to let the whole world know what the
                   Canadians did to your son!

                             PARENTS
                   Yeah!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   COME ON!

        The parents all head out the door-

        EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

        The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march
        out into the street, singing in unison as they go.

                             PARENTS
                        (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   Something's gotta give!
                   This world has become a bitch in
                   which
                   we have no desire to live!

        Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the
        middle of the road. People start honking their horns in
        frustration.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   My boy could have become a doctor
                   Or a lawyer rich and true
                   Instead he burned up like a piggy
                   on a bar-b-que!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We will fight for children's rights
                   in memory of your son!

                             PARENTS
                   We can't just stand here singing!
                   Something must be done!

        Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the
        road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over
        the busy intersection.

                             PARENTS
                   We've pushed and pushed it to the
                   edge
                   And now the time has come!
                   Something's gotta change!
                   It's time to buy a gun!
                   We can't just stand here singing
                   No we can't just stand here singing
                   No we can't just stand here
                   singing!
                   Something must be done!!!

        A few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if
        ending the song with a borage of fireworks.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM -

        The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body.

                             CARTMAN
                        (Dazed)
                   I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him
                   a hundred dollars!

                             KYLE
                   Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

                             CARTMAN
                   No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I
                   don't have to pay him!

                             KYLE
                   Oh.

        The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can
        still hear the boys voices as they exit.

                             KYLE (O.S.)
                   I can't believe he's dead.

                             CARTMAN (O.S.)
                   Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now.
                   Like this has all happened before...

        After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is
        left all alone on the operating table.

        The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face...

        ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs...

        FLASH!!

        EXT. SPACE -

        Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL
        SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.

        *note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body,
        this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.

        Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears
        warm and inviting.

        Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down
        in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.

        Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and
        bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost
        close enough to the light to touch it.

        Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.

        Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to
        a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to
        become darker and more twisted.

        Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled
        with flames and heat.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

        Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body
        plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell.

        Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and
        disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel.

        He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of
        whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth. The
        marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker
        has been placed over it that reads 'banned'.

        The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled.

                             STAN
                   How can they do this?

                             KYLE
                   It isn't fair!

                             CARTMAN
                   Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan
                   O'Brian tonight, we could at least go
                   watch that.

        The boys hang their heads and walks away.

        The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a
        mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   THIS must be him, officer! This is the
                   scum that sold R rated tickets to
                   children!

                             TICKET GUY
                   What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!

        Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen.

                             OFFICER BARBRADY
                   You can explain downtown!

                             TICKET GUY
                        (Getting dragged away)
                   Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You
                   should arrest those pervert Canadians!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will...

        EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        Establishing.

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The boys are sitting on Cartman's couch watching TV.

        ANGLE - TELEVISION - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

        Conan comes back from a commercial break. Sitting next to
        him, is Ms. Brooke Shields.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   Our next guests have the number one movie
                   in the world right now, please welcome
                   Terrance and Phillip!

        A few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage. A few
        boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in
        the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs.

        Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields.

                             PHILLIP
                   Hello, Conan!

                             TERRANCE
                   Hello, Brooke Shields!

                             CONAN
                   It's nice to have you here in America.

                             PHILLIP
                   Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all,
                   we thought what the hell!

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   So guys... I understand you have a comedy
                   routine worked out for us.

                             PHILLIP
                   We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse
                   me, Terrance.

                             TERRANCE
                   Yes, Phillip?

        Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into
        the band.  They both laugh wildly.

                             PHILLIP
                   Gotcha!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh. Nobody in the audience laughs.

        ANGLE - BOYS

        They laugh merrily.

        RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

                   Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.

                             PHILLIP
                   Cheers, Terrance!

        Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing
        nervous. He looks out into the audience...

        Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes
        eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother
        nods back.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                        (Nervous)
                   So, guys, I need to ask you a serious
                   question...

                             PHILLIP
                   I just farted Terrance back into the
                   stone age!

        They both laugh hard.

        Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh.

                             BROOKE SHIELDS
                   I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!

                             TERRANCE
                   Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was
                   it, to have a person lighting a fart on
                   fire in your movie? Who is responsible
                   for that?

        Terrance and Phillip exhange glances.

                             TERRANCE
                   Phillip, I think our friend Conan has
                   been working too hard.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone
                   light a fart on fire in your movie!

                             PHILLIP/TERRANCE
                        (Together)
                   It was our idea to have someone light a
                   fart on fire in your movie.

        ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE

        Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (Into her lapel)
                   That's it!  Move, move, move!

        ANGLE ON TERRANCE AND PHILLIP

        A battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip
        and arrest everyone in their group.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Terrance and Phillip, you are under
                   arrest for working in America without the
                   proper documents! WE GOT YOU!

        ANGLE - BOYS

                             KYLE
                   Dude, what the hell is going on?

        RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

                             TERRANCE
                   Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed
                   by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

                             PHILLIP
                   This little scrotum sucker willfully
                   deceived us!
                        (Pointing to Conan)
                   You are a bad man!

                             TERRANCE
                   And you call yourself a Canadian!
                        (To Phillip)
                   I told you we should of done Leno!

        Conan O'Brian turns away, ashamed.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian.
                   They're master manipulators. You did a
                   good job.

                             TERRANCE
                   You loved our movie, Conan!  We watched
                   it together.  You... You laughed!

        Conan grabs his head.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   What have I done?!!!

        Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke
        Shields with blood.

                             BROOKE SHIELDS
                   AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight
                   AAAGHGH!!!!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles
        Conan's lifeless body.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   You see what your filth has caused?

                             TERRANCE
                   US?! This is your mess, outraged mother!!

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock.

                             STAN
                   Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and
                   Phillip!

                             KYLE
                   Our moms suck!

                             CARTMAN
                   This could mean... No more Terrance and
                   Phillip - EVER!

        EXT. UNITED NATIONS - DAY

        Establishing shot.

        INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENERAL ASSEMBLY ROOM

        Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at
        their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation
        headsets -- in the general assembly hall.  The Canadian
        Ambassador stands before them.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby
                   condemn the actions taken by America in
                   apprehending Terrance and Phillip!

        A MURMUR goes through the crowd.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As
                   you can see from this graph, the entire
                   economy of Canada relies on Terrance and
                   Phillip! Without them we are doomed to
                   recession!

        The United Nations head bangs his gavel.

        Now Kyle's mother stands up. She is with a group of mothers
        all wearing M.A.C T-shirts.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   If I may?

        Everyone looks at Kyle's mother.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   As president and founder of M.A.C., I
                   would like to state-

                             UNITED NATIONS HEAD
                   Excuse me, M.A.C.?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Yes, Mothers Against Canada.

                             UNITED NATIONS HEAD
                   Kay.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I would like to state that Canada must
                   learn to stop infiltrating our country
                   with its graphic art!

        Cheers from the Americans.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   Last time I checked America was a free
                   country!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Look at this!

        Kyle's mother pulls Kenny's mother up by the head.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This woman's child was KILLED by your
                   country's humor! Look how upset she is!

        Kenny's mom looks fine.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   We will continue to sell Terrance and
                   Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough
                   to buy it!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Then you leave me no choice... I call for
                   an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!

        More cheers from the Americans. The Canadians look worried.

        INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

        The boys are in the check out line at Bob's supermarket.

                             CARTMAN
                   What the hell do you mean I can't get
                   Cheesy Poofs?!

                             BOB
                   Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian
                   export. We can't carry them any more.

                             KYLE
                   Who the hell made up that law?!

                             CARTMAN
                   You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD
                   Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation
                   with a delightful cheddar crunch.

                             BOB
                   There's nothing I can do. I can still
                   sell you Cheese-o's.

                             CARTMAN
                   FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!

        Cartman storms out. The boys follow him.

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

        The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door
        behind him. The boys all walk toward the living room.

                             CARTMAN
                   Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!

                             STAN
                   About what?

                             CARTMAN
                   About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This
                   whole thing has gone too far!

                             KYLE
                   I don't really think you need Cheesy-
                   Poofs, tubby-

        But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the
        living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for
        them, silently.

        Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's
        mother's face looks almost evil.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Boys, we have to have a difficult
                   discussion.

                             KYLE
                   We already know what you did. We saw it
                   on television.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and
                   Phillip?

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Stanly, you're too young to understand
                   what's good for you. That's why we
                   mothers have taken charge.

                             KYLE
                   But they fucking didn't do anything
                   wrong!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and
                   outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?

        The mothers all gasp in horror.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What was that word, young man!?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone
                   licks your ass for-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I know what it is!

                             CARTMAN
                        (To his mother)
                   Lick someone's ass?!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   The Terrance and Phillip movie has
                   obviously done irreparable damage to
                   their brains.  We have to put them in
                   rehab right away.

                             KYLE
                   What's that?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   You boys need help.  There are rehab
                   centers that specialize in treating
                   people with chronic addictions to bad
                   language.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   There are?

        Kyle's mother thinks for a second.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Well no, I guess not...  But we will
                   establish the first of its kind right
                   here in South Park.  All the children in
                   town will have to attend and receive
                   treatment from the school counselor Mr.
                   Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these
                   sorts of ideas!

                             CARTMAN
                   Why?  So you can fuck up our life some
                   more?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that
                   way!

                             CARTMAN
                   But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to
                   fucking bad language!  I don't have a
                   fucking problem!

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Kenny walks through the black void of hell. A trippy, single
        shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes.

                             KENNY
                   Mphrmo?

        No answer... No nothing...

        Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground
        scaring the shit out of him.

                             KENNY
                   MPHR!! MMLY MMT!

        Suddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and
        louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the
        clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around. He is face
        to face with SATAN!

        Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose.

        Kenny's eyes bulge open.

                             KENNY
                   MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!

                             SATAN
                   Fallen one... We have such sights to show
                   you!

        Kenny shakes. Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across
        the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in
        Kenny's face.

                             SATAN
                   I am Satan. I am your God, now.

                             KENNY
                   MPH RM!!!

        Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies
        across the room and cuts Kenny off.

                             SATAN
                   Come with me. I will show you what
                   delightful pain awaits.

        Two black DEMONS grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him
        away.

                             KENNY
                   MMMMMPHPHP!!!!

        Just then, SADDAM HUSSEIN show up next to Satan.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell,
                   kid! Relax! Take a load off!!

                             SATAN
                   You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't
                   you?!

        Kenny's eyes grow wide.

                             KENNY
                   MMMPPH!!!

        EXT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

        Establishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.  There are anti-
        drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on
        Pottery"; and, "I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds."  MR.
        MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.  There's
        a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you
                   boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay.
                   Now the sooner you recognize your
                   problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you
                   back to your third grade homeroom where
                   you belong.

                             KYLE
                   But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our
                   parents are over-reacting.

                             BEBE
                   Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even
                   like Terrance and Phillip!

        Wendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she
        doesn't even acknowledge him.

        Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having
                   Cheesy Poof withdrawal...

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay, kids from all over the State have
                   been brought here, because you all share
                   the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's
                   start with you.

        He points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the
        lake.

                             GREGORY
                   My name is Gregory... And I have a potty
                   mouth.

        Wendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this.

                             CARTMAN
                   You've got a stupid accent too.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Eric, that is not appropriate.

                             CARTMAN
                   What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the
                   ear.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly
                   what I'm talking about. We have to change
                   the way you think.

                             GREGORY
                   How are you gonna do that?

        Mr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking
        the following lines.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   There are times when you get suckered in,
                   by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en.
                   But it's when you do these things too
                   much
                        (Singing)
                   That you've got to clear your head
                   and get back in touch...

        Mr. Mackey plays the piano and sings:

                             MR. MACKEY
                   You can do it, it's all up to you,
                   mkay?
                   With a method, there's nothing you
                   can't do, mkay?
                   You don't have to spend your life
                   addicted to crack
                   Homeless on the streets giving hand-
                   jobs for cash
                   as long as you follow this simple
                   plan
                   I'm fully convinced that it's,
                   easy, mkay...

        The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a
        chalkboard.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Step one: Think about fun. Think
                   about all that you'll miss addicted
                   to this
                   Step two: Think it all through.
                   Think how's this gonna change my
                   life, what am I gonna miss?
                   Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
                   anything that gets in your way!
                   And step four: Just don't do it
                   anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

        Mackey gets the children in a circle all holding hands.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Come on, kids! Sing along!

                             KIDS
                        (Extremely half-assed)
                   You can do it, it's all up to you
                   mkay?
                   With a method, there's nothing you
                   can't do, mkay?
                   We don't have to spend our lives
                   addicted to crack
                   Homeless on the streets giving hand-
                   jobs for cash

                             MR. MACKEY
                   As long as you follow my simple
                   plan
                   I'm fully convinced that it's,
                   easy, mkay...

        Everyone starts dancing in a circle.

                             KIDS
                   Step one: Think about fun. Think
                   about all that you'll miss addicted
                   to this Step two: Think it all
                   through. Think how's this gonna
                   change my life, what am I gonna
                   miss?
                   Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
                   anything that gets in your way!
                   And step four: Just don't do it
                   anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

                             MR. MACKEY
                   It's easy, Mkay?!

        Everyone falls down laughing.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - LOUNGE

        Kyle's mom and the other moms watch the kids and Mr. Mackey
        rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What the hell do they think this is?!
                   Summer camp?!

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        Just then, Kyle's mother walks in with a scowling look,
        interupting the kids and Mr. Mackey who are still laughing
        merrily. The other mothers are behind her.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!

        Mr. Mackey stands up, looking scared.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Uh, we're just, starting our program...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This is NOT a place for fun and games!
                   This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!!
                   We at MAC have a trial to go to!

        The mothers walk away.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay.

                             CARTMAN
                   God Damn it your mom is a bitch, Kyle.

        Kyle hangs his head.

        EXT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

        A news reporter stands in front of the Supreme Court. All
        around him are protestors, with signs that say CANADA NO! and
        CAN'TADA! Still others hold signs with Kenny on them.

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S.
                   Supreme Court where the most important
                   trial of the - day - is happening.
                   Thousands of people have shown up from
                   all over the country to show their
                   outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me
                   now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor
                   little boy who was killed by the
                   Canadians.

        Kenny's mother steps into frame. She is wearing a shirt with
        Kenny's picture on it. Written on the T-shirt is 'Have you
        seen my son? No, you haven't. He's dead.'

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the
                   Canadians.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Yes, yes I do, Tom.

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Did you ever think you would see the day
                   when thousands of people were wearing
                   your son Kenny on T-shirts?

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   No I didn't. But if any of you would like
                   one they're 14.95. Available in blue or
                   white.

        The reporter thinks for a second, and then turns back to the
        camera.

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Well, we can only imagine the intense,
                   vehement trial that is going on inside.

        INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

        Terrance and Phillip are on the stand.

                             JOHNNY COCHRAN
                   Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly,
                   with malice of forethought were trying to
                   destroy American culture, yes or no?

        Terrance rips a fart.

                             JOHNNY COCHRAN
                   YES OR NO!

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids are all in the main room, sitting on a couch,
        huddled around a television.

        They laugh merrily.

                             STAN
                   Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!

        INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

                             TERRANCE
                   The Americans are just showing their TRUE
                   COLORS as smelly bastards.

                             PHILLIP
                   Fight the power!

                             TERRANCE
                   The young boy that died lit himself on
                   fire. It was unfortunate, but how can
                   they blame US?

                             PHILLIP
                   Don't believe the hype!!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids all shout agreement.

                             KIDS
                        (Adlib)
                   Yeah! WooHoo!

        BACK TO COURTHOUSE

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                             TERRANCE
                   You cannot oppress us! We will continue
                   to pursue our art. We know there are
                   Americans out there who will help us!

        Kyle's mother now stands up from the prosecutor's table.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We
                   Americans do NOT allow that for our
                   children!!

                             PHILLIP
                   Please. You teach your children that
                   America is the land of the free. But it's
                   all bullshit. You're one of the most
                   conservative countries in the world!

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The children all listen, wide-eyed.

        INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

                             TERRANCE
                   The problem is you don't allow your
                   children to think for themselves. You try
                   to raise them in a protective bubble, and
                   then when they finally get old enough,
                   they realize they've been lied to, and
                   they resent you for it.

                             PHILLIP
                   Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so
                   fucked up.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   THAT IS ENOUGH!!

                             TERRANCE
                   WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors
                   YOU from the world.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   NO THEY DON'T!

                             PHILLIP
                   YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN
                   MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN

        BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP.

        Suddenly, the screen goes blank. A sign that says 'PLEASE
        STAND BY' comes on.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids all watch, wide-eyed.

                             KYLE
                   What happened?

        INT. CANADIAN PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

        The Canadian Prime Minister stands directly in front of
        camera, looking right at us.

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our
                   national treasure Terrance and Phillip.
                   We, in turn, have taken yours... The
                   Smothers Brothers!

        The Canadian Prime Minister steps out of the way, revealing
        the Smothers Brothers tied up in chairs behind him.

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   I'll let you catch your breath... Now,
                   release Terrance and Phillip, or else we
                   will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers
                   Brothers!!

                             TOMMY SMOTHERS
                   Please listen to them!!

                   They're not fucking around!!

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   We're not fucking around. This is not
                   aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is
                   aboot freedom... This is aboot respect.
                   RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!

        Another Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime
        Minister's ear.

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA!

        He raises his middle finger, but it's all blurred and
        digitized.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group.

                             WENDY
                   Why not?

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I
                   want you to watch this movie, with all
                   the immature profanity taken out, and
                   notice how much better a movie it
                   becomes...

        Mackey puts the tape in and hits play.

        The TITLES come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'
        Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with
        'bunz'.

                             KIDS
                   HOORAY!!!

        The movie begins. Phillip walks in. But it isn't Phillip's
        voice, somebody has dubbed him over.

                             DUBBED PHILLIP
                   Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to
                   pass gas near your head.

                             DUBBED TERRANCE
                   I would rather you didn't, Phillip.

                             DUBBED PHILLIP
                   Oh? Is that so?

        Phillip farts on Terrance.

                             TERRANCE
                   Oh, you are such a maroon!

                             PHILLIP
                   You would know, dummy.

        The boys look confused.

                             TERRANCE
                   You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.

        The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a
        match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death.

        A TITLE comes up - THE END.

        And the credits roll.

                             CARTMAN
                   WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

                             KYLE
                   Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

        The lights in the theater come up.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   So you see, the point and the theme of
                   the film is kept intact. And of course,
                   the MPAA didn't cut out any of the
                   graphic violence. What did you think?

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to
                   get the taste of ass out of my mouth from
                   that piece of shit movie.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Eric, you're not watching your mouth!

                             CARTMAN
                   You get me Cheesy Poofs with the
                   delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch
                   my fucking mouth!

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated.
                   Help me to help you!

                             CARTMAN
                   Help yourself prickfuck!

                             MR. MACKEY
                   I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little
                   asshole!

        Mackey slaps his hand over his mouth and looks around, scared.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.

                   How is the children's progress?

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Very encouraging. Most of the children
                   have been weened from their naughty
                   mouths.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?

                   Well, some of the children just don't
                   respond to 12 step programs.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Then we'll have to resort to plan B and
                   call the v-chip organization.

        Dramatic MUSIC STING. Mackey looks afraid.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been
                   fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.

        Back in the courthouse, the jury walks in and sits down.

                             JUDGE
                   Madam foreman, have you reached a

                             JUDGE

                   You raise awareness by distributing
                   buttons, stickers and leaflets.

                             CARTMAN
                   That'd be sweet! We could try to bring

                   You guys don't even care. All you care
                   about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart
                   on each other more.

        The boys sit there and blink.

                             STAN

                   This is about freedom of speech, Stan,
                   about censorship.

        The handsome English kid, Gregory chimes in.

                   Yes, what's next? Barcodes on our

                   'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich,
                   chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring
                   me ten proofs of purchases and we'll
                   grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

                             KENNY
                   Mrph?

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky
                   Smores are now available in stores
                   everywhere! No biggie!

        Saddam walks over to Kenny and releases his chains.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                        (To Kenny)
                   Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get
                   to it!

        Kenny runs out and away.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!

        Saddam walks over and joins Satan on the couch.

                             SATAN
                   I don't see why you have to belittle me
                   in front of people like that.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke.
                   Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only
                   available up on Earth. He'll never get
                   'em, see?

                             SATAN
                   Sometimes I just think you don't have any
                   respect for me.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, come here, guy.

        Saddam pulls Satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Who's my cream puff?

                             SATAN
                   I am.

        INT. PTA MEETING - DAY

        A large crowd of parents has gathered for a PTA meeting.

        Kenny's mother is at a table selling dead Kenny t-shirts. She
        has a shitload of money all around her. Another MOTHER walks
        up, hands Kenny's mom money, and gets a shirt.

                             MOTHER
                   Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs.
                   McKormick?

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Why yes. Yes it is.

        Meanwhile, Kyle's mother is on the stand.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   As our next official order of business
                   here at M.A.C., we will test the new V-
                   chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was
                   created to lock children out of watching
                   certain shows on television. And now the
                   N.I.H. has created a new, exciting
                   product that they can tell us all about.
                   Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.
                   Pangloss.

        DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Thank you, parents.

        One person claps. Pangloss hits a button and a slide
        projector starts showing pictures of the device.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very
                   simple, and similar to that of the V-
                   chip. The chip is placed just under the
                   subject's skin, where it emits a small
                   but painful shock of electricity whenever
                   an obscenity is uttered.

        The parents are fascinated.

                             STAN'S FATHER
                   Now wait a minute, are you telling us
                   that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid
                   is swearing?

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   It's just like a lie detector. Certain
                   things happen in you when you swear just
                   like when you lie, the chip picks up on
                   this and gives the subject a shock.

        The parents AD LIB 'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs'

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   We are very excited to see the results of
                   this test.
                        (Calling)
                   Patient 453, would you step out here,
                   please?

        Cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Patient 453 here has been fitted with the
                   new v-chip...

                             CARTMAN
                   My head hurts.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Don't worry about that. Now, I want you
                   to say 'Doggy.'

                             CARTMAN
                   Doggy.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Notice that nothing happens.
                        (To Cartman)
                   Now say 'Montana.'

                             CARTMAN
                   Montana.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Good. Now 'Pillow'.

                             CARTMAN
                   Pillow.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Alright, now I want you to say
                   'horsefucker.'

        Cartman looks offstage to his mother.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.

        Cartman smiles.

                             CARTMAN
                   Horsefuck-

        BZZZZZAAAAT!!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!

        Cartman falls to the floor in pain. All the parents ooh and
        ahh and applaud.

                             CARTMAN
                   OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-

        BAZAAATTT!!

                             CARTMAN
                   OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T
                   FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--

        BAZAAATTT!!

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Success!! Our device works perfectly! We
                   will begin mass production immediately!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And so we have succesfully removed the
                   Canadian smut from all of our children's
                   brains.
                   We have made changes at school to ensure
                   that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to
                   smut!!!!!!! It's OVER!

        The crowd goes wild.

        EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

        School is now Naziesque. A military drum echoes in the
        distance.

        INT. CLASSROOM - SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        Stan and Kyle are sitting in their desks, waiting for school
        to begin.

        Wendy walks by on her way to her desk.

                             STAN
                   Hi Wendy.

                             WENDY
                        (Not even looking)
                   Hi Stan.

        Wendy walks on by.

                             KYLE
                   Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats
                   ass about you.

                             STAN
                        (Eyes still on Wendy)
                   I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!

                             KYLE
                   Good thing she was never your
                   girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.

        Cartman walks in and gingerly sits down.

                             KYLE
                   Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in
                   your head or your ass?

                             STAN
                   What's the difference?

        Stan and Kyle laugh.

                             CARTMAN
                   Very funny dickhead-

        BZZAAT!  The v-chip shocks Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   OW!  FUCK-

        BZZZAAAT!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AY!

        Cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap.

                             KYLE
                   Whoa!  What the hell was that?!

                             STAN
                   Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him
                   ever time he cusses!

        Stan and Kyle look at each other.  Kyle smiles.

                             KYLE
                   Hey Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   What?

                             KYLE
                   You know, me and Stan were just talking
                   about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck
                   you are.

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

        BZAAAT!

                             CARTMAN
                   SHIT-

        BZZZAAAT!!

                             CARTMAN
                   FUCK-

        BZZAAAT!!  The cycle continues as Stan and Kyle laugh merrily
        watching Cartman flopping around on the floor.

                             KYLE
                   This is sweet!!

                             STAN
                   Totally!

        Garrison stands before his class.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Okay, children, let's try a few new math
                   problems. What is five times two?

        The kids all just sit there.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Come on, children, do be shy, just give
                   it your best shot.

        Clyde raises his hand.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Yes, Clyde?

                             CLYDE
                   Twelve?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Okay, now let's try to get an answer from
                   somebody who's not a complete retard.
                   Anyone? Come on don't be shy...

        Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi
        looking American soldiers.

        They walk over to the children and start pulling off their
        'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins.

                             STAN
                   Hey, what are you doing?

                             SOLDIER
                   You can't wear these in school. It's
                   against school policy, thank you.

        Another solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a
        yellow star.

                             KYLE
                   What's that for?

                             SOLDIER 2
                   You get a star for doing well in school.

        Just as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door.

                             WENDY
                   NAZIS!!

                             STAN
                   What's the matter, Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.

                             STAN
                        (To Kyle)
                   God damn it, why does she keep saying
                   that?

        INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

        The boys are in line. Nazi-ish soldiers usher them through.

                             STAN
                   I'm so sick of these soldiers.

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, they suck.

                             CARTMAN
                   I know.  Always saying, do this, do that.
                   They think they're so cooool.
                        (To the soldier)
                   Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler!
                        (BZZZT)
                   OW!!!

        The soldier glares at him. The boys walk into the kitchen,
        where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school
        CHEF!

                             CHEF
                   Hello there, children!!

                             STAN
                   Hey, Chef.

                             CHEF
                   How would like some Salisbury Steak with
                   buttered noodles?

                             KYLE
                   We can't, we're on a hunger strike.

                             CHEF
                   A hunger strike? For what?

                             STAN
                   To free Terrance and Phillip.

                             CARTMAN
                   But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.

                             STAN
                   Chef, do you know anything about women?

                             CHEF
                   Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?

                             KYLE
                   I don't know.

                             CHEF
                   Children, I know ALL there is to know
                   about women.

                             STAN
                   What's the secret to making a woman
                   happy?

                             CHEF
                        (Dishing out food)
                   Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the
                   clitoris.

                             STAN
                   Huh?

        Suddenly, Chef realizes who he's talking to.

                             CHEF
                   Oops, I guess you haven't got that far
                   in your anatomy class, huh?

                             STAN
                   No, what does that mean, find the
                   clitoris?

                             CARTMAN
                   Is that like finding Jesus or something?

        Now Chef starts to panic.

                             CHEF
                   Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything.
                   Now move along, children! You're holding
                   up the line!

        Just then, the P.A. blares out an announcement.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA (O.S.)
                   ATTENTION ALL SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY
                   STUDENTS AND STAFF! REPORT TO THE
                   GYMNASIUM IMMEDIATELY FOR A SPECIAL
                   ANNOUNCEMENT!!

                             STAN
                   Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude.

        INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

        All the elementary students are gathered in front of a large
        television monitor.

        Mr. Garrison and his class walk in and look confused.

        The boys walk up to Chef.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Please take your seats, everyone!!!!

        They all go to their seats.

                             KYLE
                   What's going on, Chef?

                             CHEF
                   Something big, children.

        The television goes from that Emergency broadcast signal to a
        scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                       (Very serious)
                   This is a State of Emergency. We go now
                   to the White House for a VERY IMPORTANT
                   ANNOUNCEMENT from the President of the
                   United States.

        INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

        The President is sitting in a chair by the fireplace.

                             PRESIDENT CLINTON
                   Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m.
                   today, a day which will live in infamy...
                   sort of... the U.S. has declared war on
                   Canada.

        ANGLE - KIDS

        They all stare in silence. Mr. Garrison takes a deep breath.

                             CHEF
                   Oh, no...

                             MR. MACKEY
                   I don't believe it.

                             CARTMAN
                   Holy crap-
                       (BZZZT!)
                   OW!! Hey crap isn't a swear word, what
                   the fuck?!
                       (ZZZZZZTTT)
                   AGAGAGH!!!

                             PRESIDENT CLINTON
                   All Canadians are to leave the country
                   immediately, or be subject to military
                   camps. All Canadian products are to be
                   thrown out.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   How can they do this?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   I never thought there would be war again
                   in my lifetime...

        INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                             PRESIDENT CLINTON
                   Do not be afraid of this war. Instead
                   embrace it. We have God on our side. And
                   besides, they're just Canadians, what the
                   hell are they gonna do?

        INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

        Everyone watches the television in stunned silence.

                             STAN
                   Chef, what does it mean that we're at
                   war?

                             CHEF
                   It's... It's not good children.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   What do we do? Do we go on as normal
                   or...?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   I don't know Principal Victoria... I
                   don't know...

                             PRESIDENT
                   And now, I would like to bring up the
                   woman who led, and is still leading the
                   way in this glorious stand-

                             KYLE
                       (Pointing to TV)
                   HOLY SHIT DUDE!!

        Kyle's mom appears on the TV dressed in military garb.

                             PRESIDENT
                   Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.

                             CHEF
                   Isn't that your mother, Kyle?

        Kyle can't believe it.

        On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium. She
        is dressed to the hilt. She hugs the President and the first
        lady and then takes a deep breath.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   My fellow Americans. I have led this
                   fight in the War against profanity. I
                   have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our
                   neighbor to the north has abused us for
                   the last time.

                             PRESIDENT
                   As Commander in chief, I have ordered our
                   Army to set up defensive positions along
                   the US-Canada border in anticipation of
                   an attack.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What about air strikes?

                             PRESIDENT
                   Huh?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We have to have air strikes on their
                   military and entertainment centers.  It's
                   the only way to ensure that their smut
                   can't reach American soil!

                             PRESIDENT
                   Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes
                   are necessary.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I
                   remind you that our country's heart and
                   soul are at stake, and our children's
                   minds are the battlefield!
                   The bastard Canadians want to fight us
                   because we won't tolerate their potty
                   mouths. Well, if it is war they want...
                   THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

        A huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's
        mother. She is obviously floored by it. She can't help but
        smile. She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises
        her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder.

        The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the
        rest of the crowd.

        Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.

                             CHEF
                   Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.

                             CARTMAN
                   Amen to that.

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Kenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another
        one of hell's prisoners.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

                             GEORGE BURNS
                   Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have
                   proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores?
                   Beat it, kid.

        Kenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door.
        Kenny opens the door and peeps inside-

        INT. SATAN'S BEDROOM - KENNY'S POV

        Saddam and Satan are lying in bed.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   You just get cranky when you're tired,
                   that's all.  I told you that you
                   shouldn't have tried to carry that futon
                   all by yourself.

                             SATAN
                   I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not
                   too big to carry myself-

        Just then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN.

                             TV
                   In war news, countries from Europe and
                   Asia are joining sides in the Canadian-
                   American War-

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and
                   forget about the whole thing-

                             SATAN
                   SHHH!!!!

                             TV
                   ...The death count is already on its way
                   to 10 million with no signs of slowing
                   down.  What started as a spat between the
                   United States and Canada is quickly
                   turning into World War III-

        Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks
        off the television and sits up in bed.

                             SATAN
                   It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen
                   are drawing nigh!  The time of the
                   prophecy is upon us!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh I love when you get all biblical
                   Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my
                   crank!

                             SATAN
                   No I'm being serious! Those Canadian
                   entertainers are to be killed. It is the
                   seventh sign.

        Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient
        tome.  Satan turns the pages as he talks.

                             SATAN
                   Behold, the signs of my reign on earth
                   are all falling into place!  The fall of
                   an empire-

        He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of
        Ceasar.

                             SATAN
                   -The coming of a comet-

        He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth.

                             SATAN
                   Jerry Springer's movie doing more than
                   ten million box office-

        A picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money.

                             SATAN
                   ....And now....

        Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like
        Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head.

                             SATAN
                   The seventh sign!  When the blood of
                   these Canadians touches American soil...
                   It will be my time to rise!!!!!

        DRAMATIC music.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!

                             SATAN
                   Do you always think about sex?  I'm
                   talking about some very important stuff
                   here!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Listen buttercup, let's make love and
                   forget about the whole thing.

                             SATAN
                   Is sex the only thing that matters to
                   you?

        Saddam thinks for a second.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I love you.

        Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   You know I do.

                             SATAN
                   I know.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   So what do you say we shut off that light
                   and get close, huh?

        Satan reaches over and turns off the light.  Everything goes
        pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well.

        A beat.

        Then, a small moan from Satan.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is
        reading out of a huge book.

                             KYLE
                   Does it say what the clitoris is?

                             STAN
                   All it says is that it's above the
                   vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?

                             KYLE
                   Isn't that in Arizona or something?

        Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE
        bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian
        items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away.

        The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it
        starts to burn.

        Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing.

                             STAN
                   What is this?

                             CARTMAN
                   They're burning all the Canadian stuff
                   cause of the war.

                             STAN
                   That book wasn't Canadian!

        Clyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and
        Phillip dolls into the burning mass.

        Kyle stops him on his way back.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip
                   anymore?

                             CLYDE
                   Of course not! We're at war! My daddy
                   says I HATE Canadians now!

        More kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff.

        Several random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of
        the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys'
        parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the
        charge.

                             MAC MOTHER
                   THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!!
                   MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR
                   CHILDREN!!!

        A townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire.

        Another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy
        Poofs.
   
                          CARTMAN
                   NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY
                   GOD, WHY?!
   
        Cartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn
        away.

                             CARTMAN
                   This is all cause of your mom, Kyle.
                   She's such a bitch-
                       (BBBZAATT!!)
                   AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.

                             KYLE
                   And she's getting worse...

                             STAN
                   Dude... Isn't that your brother?

        Kyle looks to where a group of big, mean FIFTH GRADERS have
        encircled Ike.

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   Why don't you go back to your own
                   country, CANADIAN!

                             FIFTH GRADER 2
                   Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride
                   donkeys!

                             IKE
                   Eee todo ba!

        Kyle's eyes grow wide. He dashes over.

                             KYLE
                   Hey! Leave him alone!

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like
                   rats.

                             KYLE
                   He's my brother!

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   You don't look Canadian.

                             KYLE
                   He's adopted!

        Kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him.

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   Well you better get his beady eyed
                   Canadian ass out of America before my
                   daddy finds him!!

        The boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and
        throw more Canadian items into the fire.

                             KYLE
                   It's only a matter of time before my mom
                   has HIM burned too!

                   What has the world come to? This is
                   horrible. We're locked up, burning books,

                   happening?

        DRAMATIC MUSIC begins.

                   I don't know. But it has gone far enough!

        INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - KYLE'S DAD'S OFFICE

        Kyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer. Stan and
        Cartman are waiting in the background.

                             KYLE
                   Okay... I just need to find a few private
                   message boards...

                             STAN
                   Wait! Before we put a message out, do a
                   search on the word 'clitoris'.

                             KYLE
                   Okay...

        Kyle types in the word and hits return.

                             KYLE
                       (Reading the screen)
                   "Found Eight Million Pages With the Word

                             STAN
                   Wow!

                             KYLE
                   I'll just try the first one.

        Kyle clicks the mouse. They wait for the screen to load.
        Finally, it does.

                             KYLE
                   Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a
                   horse!

        Stan and Cartman rush over.

                             STAN
                   Is it Cartman's mom?

                             CARTMAN
                   Very funny!

                             KYLE
                   Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!!

        Cartman looks at the screen.

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh, son of a bitch!
                       (ZZAP!!)
                   AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!

                             STAN
                   Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!

        Ike bounces in, happily.

                             IKE
                   Ber dada!

                             KYLE
                   Get out of here Ike, you're too young for
                   this stuff!

                             IKE
                   Papa mama simi.

        Ike bounces out.

                             CARTMAN
                   Come on, just get to the message board!

                             KYLE
                   I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian
                   server... I've got to break into the main
                   frame...

        Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll
                   try to reroute the encryptions...

        Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys.

                             STAN
                   Dude, do you know what you're doing?

                             KYLE
                   No, dude, all you have to do is hit the
                   keys really fast and say a bunch of
                   stupid shit and it works.
   
        Just then the screen pops up. Access Granted.

                             KYLE
                   Bingo. Okay, here we go...

                   Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

                             KYLE
                   We're not gonna have pie and punch!

                             CARTMAN
                   More people will come if they think

                       (Dramatically)

        Triumphant MUSIC cue.

        INT. KYLE'S ATTIC

        The door to the attic pops open.  Kyle shoves Ike up into the
        attic.

                             KYLE
                   You stay up here in the attic, Ike.
                   Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?

                             IKE
                   Uhh...

                             KYLE
                   Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.

        The door closes and it is dark.

        Ike blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street
        below.

        A few armed soldiers walk by.

        Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to
        play.

        INT. PENTAGON - NIGHT

        Tons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant
        computer screens show Canada's latest attacks.

                             SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                   Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des
                   Moines!!

                             PRESIDENT
                   How can you tell?

        Everyone laughs merrily.

                             SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                   Good one, sir!

        Suddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding
        some papers.

                             PENTAGON GUY
                   Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing
                   into Canadian computers! It looks like we
                   may have a resistance movement
                   starting...

        The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's
        mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms
        behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military
        badges on her.

                             PRESIDENT
                       (Showing her the papers)
                   Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance...
                   It's probably Canadian spies!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Well find out where that signal is coming
                   from!  Then hunt them down like dogs!
                   Any and all Canadian influence must be
                   stopped at all cost!

                             PRESIDENT
                   Yes ma'am!

        The President starts to run off.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And Bill?

                             PRESIDENT
                   Yes?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I'm needing lunch.

                             PRESIDENT
                   Right away, ma'am!

        The president runs off.

        Establishing.

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as
                   more and more troops are needed to fight
                   the Canadian forces...

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        Cartman's mother is tucking him into bed.

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   What is quickly being referred to as 'The
                   Great Canadian-American War' has already
                   reached a death toll of two million.

        Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Goodnight, honey.

                             CARTMAN
                   Mom... When is the war gonna be over?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You
                   want it to end quickly, huh?

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz
                   all my favorite TV shows have been
                   replaced by news and it's pissing me off.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh.

        With that, Cartman's mother gets up-

                             CARTMAN
                   Mom...

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Yes, hon?

                             CARTMAN
                   If you went down on a horse... You'd tell
                   me, right?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Sure, hon. Goodnight.

        She switches off the light, and leaves.

        Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and
        thinks.

        He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but
        then tries to close his eyes to sleep.

                             CARTMAN
                   Go away, scary noise.

        Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -

        KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.

        Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.

        Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he
        makes no sound.

        Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.

        Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny
        disappears.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

                             CARTMAN
                   I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

        Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she
        just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh you poor dear. You've been through so
                   much...

                             CARTMAN
                   I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire
                   and now he's all pissed off!!
                       (BZZTZT!)
                   AGH! I can't say pissed off?!
                       (BAZZTZT!!)
                   AGH!!

        INT. HELL - DAY (MOVED)

        Kenny is again snooping around. He quietly creaks Satan's
        door open and walks in.

        Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.

                             SATAN
                   The execution of Terrance and Phillip is
                   imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!

        Kenny looks scared.

                             SATAN
                       (Evil and scary)
                   Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for
                   the souls of your pitiful friends that-

        Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey Satan!  I got some great new home
                   furnishings today!

        Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to
        Kenny is squashed again.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get
                   something to match with that bathroom
                   tile!

        Saddam looks at Kenny.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of
                   purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!
                   Well, keep lookin!

        A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.

                             SATAN
                   Do you wanna know what I did today?

        Saddam lets out a sigh.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   What did you do today Satan?

                             SATAN
                   You don't care.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon
                   thing has got you all stressed out. Let's
                   make love.

                             SATAN
                   Do you remember when you first got here?
                   We used to talk all night long. Until the
                   sun came up... We would just lie in bed
                   and TALK.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   That's because I wanted to fuck you,
                   dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those
                   pants down!

                             SATAN
                   Don't call me dumb!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!

        As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and
        forth as if watching a tennis match.

                             SATAN
                   How come you always want to make love to
                   me from behind? Is it because you want to
                   pretend I'm somebody else?

        Saddam sighs.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who
                   am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?

        A beat.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Come on, kid. Help me with these shower
                   curtains.

        Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad
        music playing.

                             SATAN
                       (Gently)
                   Sometimes I think
                   When I look up real high
                   That there's a whole world up there
                   And just maybe it could be mine
                   But then, I sink
                   because it's here I'm supposed to
                   stay
                   but I don't even know how or why
                   its supposed to be that way-

        Satan walks to his veranda.

                             SATAN
                   Up there, there is so much room
                   Where babies burp and flowers bloom
                   Everyone dreams I can dream too
                   Up there, Up where
                   The skies are ocean blue
                   I could be safe and live without a
                   care... Up there

        Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.

                             SATAN
                   They say I don't belong
                   That my place is down below
                   Because of my beliefs I'm supposed
                   to stay where evil is sewn
                   But what is evil anyway?
                   Is there reason to the rhyme?
                   Without evil there could be no good
                   So it must be good to be evil
                   sometimes
                   Up there, there is so much room
                   Where babies burp and flowers bloom.
                   Everyone dreams I can dream too
                   Up there, Up where
                   The skies are ocean blue
                   I could be safe and life without a
                   care... Up there

        PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan.

        EXT. SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

        A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small
        building.

        INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT

        Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La
        Resistance'.

        Cartman comes running in, he looks scared.

                             KYLE
                   You're late, Cartman!

                             CARTMAN
                   I had to ride my bike here. My behind is
                   killing me.

                             KYLE
                   Your behind?

                             CARTMAN
                   I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if
                   I say 'ass-
                       (BBZZAATT)
                   OW!!!

                             KYLE
                   Did you bring the pie and punch?

                             CARTMAN
                   No you guys... Something happened... You
                   guys wanna hear something creepy?
                       (Looking over each shoulder)
                   I don't think Kenny is dead.

                             STAN
                   What?

                             CARTMAN
                   I saw him last night!

                             KYLE
                   I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny
                   every day.

                             CARTMAN
                   YOU DO?!

                             KYLE
                   Sure, dude.  On the face of every child,
                   on the smile of every baby...

        Kyle and Stan laugh again.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey!  I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I
                   think he's haunting me.

        KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!

        The boys all look scared.

                             KYLE
                   Somebody's here...

        The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in
        front of their eyes.

                             KYLE
                   Who is it?

                             VOICE
                   Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

                             KYLE
                   What's the password?

                             VOICE
                   Uhh... I don't know.

                             KYLE
                   Guess.

                             VOICE
                   Uhh... Bacon.

                             KYLE
                   Okay.

        Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab
        stands there looking handsome and angelic.

                             GREGORY
                   Viva la Resistance.

                             STAN
                   Oh no, it's that kid.

                             GREGORY
                   This is the place--

        Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes
        grow wide.

                             STAN
                   Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?

                             GREGORY
                   Well, apparently you have a bigger heart
                   than we thought. Let us get this meeting
                   underway, there are others coming.

        Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.

        INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER

        Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking
        RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of
        twelve.

        The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA
        RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall.

        Stan and Kyle look nervous.

                             STAN
                   Everyone be seated, please.

        The kids all sit down.

                             KYLE
                   Wow, a lot of people showed up.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, so what do we say?

                             KYLE
                   I thought you had something planned.

                             STAN
                   Me?!

        Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch.

                             STAN
                       (Nervous)
                   Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are
                   supposed to be killed, and we think that
                   sucks ass!!

        The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy,
        who is sitting next to Gregory.

                             STAN
                   Uhh... So we think we should prank call a
                   bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas
                   sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA
                   LA RESISTANCE!!!

        Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.

                             STAN
                   Uhh...

        Gregory stands up.

                             GREGORY
                   May I?

                             STAN
                   What?

        Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.

                             GREGORY
                   Terrance and Phillip are currently being
                   held at a Canadian Internment camp two
                   kilometers outside of town.
                   They are to be executed tomorrow during a
                   star-studded USO show for the troops.

        Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan
        and Kyle can't believe it.

                             GREGORY
                   We must sneak into the camp through this
                   duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip
                   inside... The war is escalating, and the
                   American forces are preparing for a large
                   scale attack on Canada. That means the
                   time is now...

                             KYLE
                   Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

        Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.

                             GREGORY
                   This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go
                   myself.

        Wendy smiles at Gregory.

                             STAN
                   No!

        Everyone looks at Stan.

                             STAN
                   WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to
                   save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!

                             GREGORY
                   This will be very dangerous... Are you
                   quite sure?

                             CARTMAN
                   Fuck that!
                       (BZZT)
                   AGAGH!!

                             STAN
                   We're going... Let's run through the
                   plan!!

        INT. SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS

        A huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different
        battalions.

        We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat,
        Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather,
        Jesus, Officer Barbrady....

                             JIMBO
                   Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I
                   was gettin' worried I'd never see another
                   one!

                             NED
                   I know what you mean.

                             JIMBO
                   And they're giving all us troops a big
                   USO tomorrow with celebrities and
                   executions!

        PAN OVER to Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   You look great in your new uniform Mr.
                   Hat.

                             MR. HAT
                   You do too, Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-
                   leave so I can go get me some poontang.

        Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back.

        GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps
        up to a podium and addresses the troops.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   PAY ATTENTION!

        The crowd settles down.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   It's no secret that the Evil Canadian
                   Federation has scored major victories all
                   over the United State.  We have brought
                   you here because you ar America's best,
                   and last hope.

        Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his
        ear.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Oh... Apparently you're not the best,
                   you're simply the last. Anyway, let's
                   strategize... Map!

        A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in
        front of him.  He walks around it pointing out things with a
        laser-pointer.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Our sources have told us that the
                   Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's
                   USO show and stop us from executing
                   Terrance and Phillip.

        He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Now each battalion has a specific code-
                   name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise
                   your hands-

        Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand.

        Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that
        everybody else in his section is also African American.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   You will be the all-important first
                   defense wave, which we will call
                   'Operation Human Shield'.

                             CHEF
                   Hey, wait a minute...

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human
                   Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But
                   don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until
                   the bitter end.  Battalion 14?

        A bunch of white guys raise their hands.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The
                   Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5
                   here-

        He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   -and try not to get killed for God's
                   Sake.  Are there any questions men?

        Chef raises his hand.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Yes soldier?

                             CHEF
                   Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
                   Proclamation?

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   I don't listen to hip-hop.

        Chef scowls.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   If you somehow live, we will regroup on
                   this hill outside--

        Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Now what's wrong with this thing?

        General Plymkin messes with the controls.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Fucking windows 98!

        General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with
        the cord in his hands.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   GET GATES IN HERE!!!

        BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER
                   AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO
                   THE INTERNET!!!

                             BILL GATES
                   It is faster, over five million--

        Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates
        falls to the floor, dead.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Alright men, get lots of rest, and
                   prepare thyselves for battle!

        INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT

        In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing
        the plan.

                             GREGORY
                   ...after you clear this zone here,
                   rendezvous behind this ridge where
                   Terrance and Phillip should be held.

                             KYLE
                   Gotcha.

                             GREGORY
                   You are indeed brave, but you will need
                   someone who's done this sort of thing
                   before.  MOLE!

        Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving
        a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out)

        The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops
        THE MOLE.  He is a very bitter little nine year old French
        kid with a THICK French accent.

                             VOICE
                   Oui?

                             GREGORY
                   Thank you for coming, Mole.

                             THE MOLE
                   So... We must free more Canadian
                   prizoners?

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, I guess.

                             THE MOLE
                   America... She iz a beetch that sheets on
                   her own children.

        Stan and Kyle look at each other confused.

                             GREGORY
                   This is the Mole.  He will accompany you
                   to the prison where Terrance and Phillip
                   are.  He is an expert in covert
                   operations and a lifelong fighter for
                   freedom.

                             THE MOLE
                   Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured
                   down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want
                   this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.

        Everyone stares at The Mole.

                             GREGORY
                   Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy
                   is... kept safe?

        Stan gets pissed.

                             KYLE
                   Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me
                   death!!!

                             OTHERS
                   YEA!!!

        Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely
        gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.

                             GREGORY
                   God has smiled upon you this day
                   The fate of a nation in your
                   hands...

        Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good
        this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.

                             GREGORY
                   As brothers and sisters we unite
                   And behind you we shall fight!
                   Until only the most righteous
                   belief stands!

        The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.

                             GREGORY
                   Do you see the distant flames?
                   they bellow in the night
                   Fight in all our names
                   For what we know is right
                   And if you all get shot and cannot
                   carry on
                   Though you die, La Resistance
                   lives on!

                             KYLE
                   What? Shot?

        Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join
        in the song.

                             KIDS
                   You might get stabbed in the head
                   by a dagger or a sword
                   You might be burned to death
                   or skinned alive or worse!

                             GREGORY
                   But when they torture you
                   You will not feel a need to run
                   For though you die, La Resistance
                   Lives on!

                             KIDS
                   Do you hear the beating drum?
                   It is our hearts all joined to one
                   It is the music of our souls
                   knowing we have much to overcome!

        As THE SONG CONTINUES we-

        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

        The MAC Mothers are on a stage, preparing two electric
        chairs.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Something must be done!
                   Tomorrow it will be!
                   We're going to execute this threat
                   to our democracy!

        All the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with
        American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made
        from selling t-shirts.

                             M.A.C. MOTHERS
                   And after that our kids will be
                   safe from all the Canadian scum!
                   The time is now the time is here

        The song still CONTINUES as we

        EXT. HELL - CONTINUOUS

        Satan stands on his veranda.

                   I want to be part of that world!
                   But if only I had the strength to
                   go without HIM...
                   If only I had the strength to leave
                   him behind...
                   Get on with my life in that
                   world...
                   Start over as part of that world...

        INT. MILITARY BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

        The soldiers, including Garrison, Mackey, Ned and Jimbo are
        in their bunks.

                   Tomorrow we face our destiny!
                   Tomorrow we fight to keep our
                   country free!

                   Like our forefathers we shall
                   answer the call!

        PAN DOWN to Chef's bunk where he is lying naked with a hot
        chick. As usual, Chef sings a song that has absolutely no
        relevance to what's going on.

                             CHEF
                       (Stroking woman's arm)

                   diamonds
                   Baby your butt is tender like the
                   night
                   I can see by the look in your pants
                   that you want to treat me right.
                   I'll whisper sweet nothings in your
                   cleavage
                   And you can kiss me gently with
                   your tongue
                   And I'll make love to you so deeply
                   That you'll feel pressure clear up
                   to your lungs.

        Meanwhile, the soldiers continue their song.

                             SOLDIERS
                   Something must be done!
                   Something's gotta give!

        Ike blinks.  Does he understand them? he picks up a small
        book and starts to write in it.

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Satan paces back and forth in hell.

                             SATAN
                   This is it! World War Three is at hand!
                   The millennium nears!

        Satan crosses to one of his small demons.

                             SATAN
                   Prepare the minions for the rising of
                   Gothos!

        The demon dashes off.

                   This is so exciting! Let's fuck!

        Satan sighs and bows his head.

                             SATAN
                   This is the millennium, Saddam! This is
                   Armageddon! There's more to life than
                   sex!

                   what I do. I want you to respect my MIND.

                   I DO respect your mind! It turns me on!
                   It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of
                   you! Don't you see?

                   Hey guy, relax, put out
                   You gotta put out for me!
                   I'm just a man with needs
                   And right now I need your
                   generosity!
                   I love your eyes, your nose and
                   lips
                   So drop those pants and do some
                   dips
                   Come on guy, you gotta relax
                   relax, put out for me!

        Kenny looks confused.

                             SATAN
                   What if I, don't wanna put out?
                   That's all you ever say
                   Relax put out
                   I'm a living creature, I have
                   feelings too, I don't need this
                   abuse from you-

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, guy, relax, put out!
                   You gotta relax, shut your mouth-
                   Baby I'd do anything for ya!
                   Now don't make me smack you in the
                   eye like last time-

        Kenny keeps watching as Saddam throws on a Shakey's hat and
        does a quick softshoe. Satan rolls his eyes.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I get what I want, and what I want
                   is for youuuuu toooo put ooooout!!!

        Saddam finishes the song and Satanhangs his head.

                             SATAN
                   What if I just left?

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides,
                   you know that if you left me, I'd hunt
                   you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna
                   go grab a drink.

        Saddam leaves. Satan looks about to cry, but then notices
        Kenny still standing there.

                             SATAN
                   What are you doing?! Get on with your
                   misery!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

                             SATAN
                   Him? I don't know... He can be nice...
                   sometimes.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm.

                             SATAN
                   What do you mean?! I could leave him if I
                   wanted to!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.

        Satan lowers his head. Slowly he starts to cry. Kenny walks
        over and pats him on the back.

        EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND

        Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the
        mountains.  Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro.

        There's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats.
        There's a giant banner reading "USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!"

        Loads of soldiers file into their seats.

                             ANNOUNCER
                   Alright you men! The USO show is about to
                   start!!

        The military men go wild.

                             ANNOUNCER
                   Get ready for loads of entertainment and
                   fabulous celebrities! To be followed
                   immediately by the swift and nasty
                   execution of Terrance and Elroy!

        The crowd goes crazy again.

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - BEHIND THE USO SHOW - DUSK

        Right out of Nazi Germany.  Barbed wire, guards, the whole
        bit.

        ANGLE ON BOYS

        They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground
        underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around
        the camp.

        The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes,
        clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.

                             THE MOLE
                   Be careful not to touch this wire-

        A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.

                             CARTMAN
                   OW!  MOTHERFUCKER!

        BZZAAAAT!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   FUC-

        Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to
        cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove.

                             CARTMAN
                   MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!!

        BZAAT!

                             CARTMAN
                   MMMPPPHHH!!!

        Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the
        camp.

                             THE MOLE
                   It sounds like the USO show has started.
                   We have precious little time...

        Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp.

                             KYLE
                   Oh my God...

                             THE MOLE
                   God? ...Let me tell you something about
                   God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.

        Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly.

                             STAN
                   How are we ever gonna find them?

        The Mole whips out some night vision goggles.

        ANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

        The Mole inspects the camp.  He sees a guard on a guard
        tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing
        in a line in rags.

        The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see
        the saddened faces of the Canadians.

                             KYLE
                   Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and
                   Phillip?

                             THE MOLE
                   No. Zey must have zem inside. We will
                   have to dig.

                             KYLE
                   That's gonna take a long time!

                             THE MOLE
                   Time? Did time matter to the
                   Revolutionists who were forced to eat
                   their own shit while dying in the
                   dungeons of ze King?

        The boys think.

        EXT. USO SHOW - DAY

        Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show
        in Apocalypse Now.

        Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the
        landing platform and touches down.  The US army men cheer.

        The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the
        microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is
        wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Ladies and gentlemen of the American war
                   effort, we salute you!

        A big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the
        power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and
        forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more
        Pattonlike.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Tomorrow you will be risking your lives
                   so that our children will have a better
                   future... God bless you men. And God
                   bless this filth free nation. Many of you
                   will die. Die like blood bathed pigs.  So
                   tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A
                   HUNDRED STARS! Now without further ado, I
                   give you...

        Out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and
        brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to
        offer.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Pint size pixie and darling of the indie
                   movie scene, Winona Ryder!

        She gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder
        emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience.
        She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   Hi guys!  I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder!

        One guy claps.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   I want you all to know I'm super psyched
                   to be here today.  You guys rock.  What
                   you're doing for our country so sooo
                   cool.  It's so real.  I've been acting
                   since I was twelve and I can't
                   distinguish between make believe and real
                   life.

        Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   And then I confuse me real life with my
                   big-screen one.  And sure, people get
                   hurt, and I'm sorry about that but
                   Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault
                   that I can get any guy I want.  And
                   that's reality to me.  But you guys...
                   wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It
                   doesn't get any more real--  Now, this
                   one goes out to you.

        She cues the band which has been assembled from the same
        helicopter.  Jazz music starts up.

        It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   You know what I'm gonna do for you now,
                   don't you?

        'New York, New York' continues to play.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   WRONG!
                       (Singing)
                   The bells are ringin'
                   For me and my gal!
                   The birds are singin'
                   For me and my gal!-
   
        INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - BELOW THE USO SHOW

        The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all
        fours.  Cartman holds a flashlight.

                             CARTMAN
                   Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't
                   know we were gonna get all dirty and
                   stuff.

                             THE MOLE
                   Sheet!

                             STAN
                   What is it?

                             THE MOLE
                   Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis
                   direction!

                             STAN
                   We're going to die here like baby mice
                   who have had no milk in days.  Dry up
                   into crunchy little pinkies.

        The boys stare.

        A beat.

                             THE MOLE
                   Or, we can dig UP.

        The mole starts digging up towards the ground.

        EXT. INSIDE THE PRISON CAMP

        Mole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search
        light passes over the hole.

                             THE MOLE
                   Sheet!

        Mole ducks, just avoiding the light.

        Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole.

        The whole camp is in front of them.  There is a HUGE
        barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)  A
        dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with
        Howitzers.  It doesn't look good.

                             THE MOLE
                   Move! Move!

        One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the
        ground, and run for a nearby building.  Once at the building,
        they all duck to avoid the search lights.

                             THE MOLE
                   Okay.... The Americans must be holding
                   Terrance and Phillip in one of those
                   bunkers. We will split up here.  Let's
                   synchronize watches!

        The others look at each other.

                             KYLE
                   We don't have watches.

        A beat.

                             THE MOLE
                   You don't have watches?

                             STAN
                   Dude, you didn't say anything about
                   watches.

                             THE MOLE
                   What do you think this is kid?  Lick
                   Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking
                   kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life
                   with consequences you take to the grave!

                             KYLE
                   Dude, we don't have watches.

                             THE MOLE
                   Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?

                             STAN
                   Got it.

                             THE MOLE
                   And ze rope?

                             STAN
                   Check.

                             THE MOLE
                   And the butfor?

                             KYLE
                   What's a butfor?

                             THE MOLE
                   For pooping, silly.

        A beat... Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and
        slowly blows the smoke.

                             THE MOLE
                   Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you
                   stand watch here and await my return. If
                   any guards come by, make a sound like a
                   dying giraffe.

                             KYLE
                   What's a dying giraffe sound like?

                             THE MOLE
                       (Putting his hands to his
                        mouth)
                   Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.

                             KYLE
                   Kay.

        The Mole turns to Cartman.

                             THE MOLE
                   Cartman, over zere, is the electrical
                   box. You must sneak over zere and shut it
                   off before I return with Terrance and
                   Phillip or the alarms will sound and I
                   will be shot full of holes. Got it?

                             CARTMAN
                   Okay.

                             THE MOLE
                   You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY
                   IMPORTANT do you understa-

                             CARTMAN
                   I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU
                   FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!

        Cartman storms off.

                             THE MOLE
                   I will tunnel my way into ze buildings,
                   and find ze prisoners.

        The Mole starts to dig.

                             KYLE
                   Be careful, dude.

                             THE MOLE
                   Careful? Was my mother careful when she
                   stabbed me in the heart with a clothes
                   hanger while I was still in ze womb?

        And with that, The Mole quickly starts to tunnel his way
        underground.

                             STAN
                   Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up.

        EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

        Back on stage at the USO show.  Winona Ryder is just
        finishing up her song.

                             WINONA RYDER
                       (Singing)
                   ....It's a hell of a TOWN!  And
                   that's my New York Melodyyyyyy!!!!

        The band finishes with a flourish. Winona takes a bow.

        One person in the entire audience claps.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Let's hear it again for the one and only
                   Winona Ryder!!!

        The same guy claps again.

                             ONE CLAPPING GUY
                   We love you, Winona!

        Everybody else in the audience just stares at him.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Next up we have a special treat...

                   GAY AL'S BIG GAY EXPERIENCE!!!

        The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage.  Winona
        fumes in the wings.

                             RANDOM SOLDIER
                   This guy is the coolest!

                             RANDOM SOLDIER 2
                   Totally man!

        The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set
        complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of
        colorfully dressed dancers.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   How we all feeling tonight?!

        Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy!". Now the
        place is rocking!! Everybody loves Big Gay Al!

        Winona can't believe it.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I can't hear you...

                             CROWD
                   Happy!!!

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Friends, you know why I'm here... I'm
                   here to teach TOLERANCE!!

        The crowd cheers.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm here to say that we're all PEOPLE
                   under God, and we should embrace, and
                   accept our differences!!

        The crowd cheers louder.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   And that means we should LOVE CANADIANS
                   TOO!!

        The entire place goes incredibly quiet.

        You can hear a pin drop.

        Silence...

        Deafening silence...

                             BIG GAY AL
                   JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!!

        Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage
        and starts to sing.

                             BIG GAY AL
                       (Singing)
                   Bombs are flying
                   People are dying
                   Children are crying
                   Politicians are lying too
                   Cancer is killing
                   Texaco is spilling
                   The whole world's gone to hell
                   But how are you?

        Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all
        his dancers dash to his side.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm super!  Thanks for asking!
                   All things considered I'm doing
                   super
                   I must say!
                   Very peachee
                   Nothing bugs me
                   'Cause everything is super when
                   you're
                   -don't you think I look cute in
                   this hat?

        The crowd is absolutely confused.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple
                   But I just can't feel bad for you
                   right now
                   Because I'm feeling so insanely
                   super
                   That even seeing you in that chair
                   can't bring me down!

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ANOTHER AREA

        Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to
        building. He is scared out of his mind.

                             CARTMAN
                       (Imitating the Mole)
                   Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very
                   important, Cartman... Stupid British
                   piece of shi-
                       (BAZZT!)
                   OW!

        He approaches the electrical box.  Just as he's about to open
        it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.  Cartman
        gets scared and hides in the shadows.  The soldiers continue
        walking...

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big
                   Gay AL!

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
                   Me too!!

        ...And pass a terrified Cartman.

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA

        The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return.

                             KYLE
                   I don't think he's coming back, dude.

        Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is
        carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me
                   out of there!! They locked me up for
                   selling movie tickets to minors!

                             THE MOLE
                   Is this one of zem?

                             KYLE
                   No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!

                             THE MOLE
                   Oh... Alright, back you go.

        The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole.

                             TICKET GUY
                   No! Please! I don't want to go back!!

        The boys sit back down and wait again.

        EXT. USO SHOW/STAGE - CONTINUOUS

        Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues-

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm super! Thanks for asking!
                   All things considered I'm doing
                   better than okay!
                   Feeling peaches
                   nothing bugs me
                   Everything is super when you're
                   -don't you think I look cute in
                   this hat and my little shoes and
                   this matching tie that I got at
                   Merv's?

        The chorus guys all pick Big Gay Al up and dance around with
        him on stage.

                             CHORUS
                   He's super! Thanks for asking!
                   All things considered he is better
                   than okay!
                   And it's peachee, nothing bugs him
                   Everything is super when you're-
                   Let's fight fight fight against
                   Canada today!!!!!!

        The song ends and everyone erupts into applause.

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't
        around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out.

                             SATAN
                   The execution is going to happen any
                   moment... We must prepare.

        The demons make excited noises.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

                             SATAN
                   Get everyone in hell ready. When the
                   blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the
                   day is ours!

        Two of the demons head for Satan's room.

                             SATAN
                   No! Not Saddam. Don't wake him... Uh...
                   I'll tell him...

        Satan walks to the bedroom.

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ELECTRICAL BOX AREA

        Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking
        all around for soldiers.

        He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large
        switch labeled ON and OFF.  He reaches to turn off the switch
        when he feels a tap on his shoulder.

        Cartman jumps.

                             CARTMAN
                   Agh!!!

        Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see -
        KENNY!!

                             CARTMAN
                   Son of a gun!  HECK!

        Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny
        again struggles to speak.

                             CARTMAN
                   GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN
                   FAULT!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmprmmh rm!!

                             CARTMAN
                   I don't have proofs of purchases from
                   Snacky Smores, Kenny!

                             KENNY
                   MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AGAGAH!!

        Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on.

        INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

        Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic.

        Suddenly, the attic door bursts open!

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Found one!

        Other soldiers file into the attic and grab Ike by the arms.

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Yep, that's a Canadian alright.

                             IKE
                   Sibi mammama.

        The American Soldier picks up Ike.

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   So, thought you could hide from us, did
                   you?! Take him away!

        The soldiers drag Ike down the stairs.

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
                   Sir, look at this!
                       (Holding up a book)
                   He was writing some kind of diary...

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Diary?  What does it say?

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
                       (Reading)
                   Cookie monster.  Banana.

        Sweeping, moving MUSIC STING.

        EXT.  INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA

        Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it! Come on, Mole we're running out
                   of time!

        Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming.

        But it's only Cartman. He's panting heavily.

                             CARTMAN
                   You guys! Seriously! You guys!

                             KYLE
                   What Cartman?!

                             CARTMAN
                   Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

                             STAN
                   Oh, brother.

                             KYLE
                   Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

        Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks.

                             KYLE
                   Cartman?!

                             CARTMAN
                   Whoops.

        Just then, all the alarms in the place go off.

                             KYLE
                   Oh shit!

        From the distance, the boys hear gunshots.

        Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole. The boys see that
        The Mole has been shot up badly.

                             THE MOLE
                   Ze alarms! Zey went off!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.

        As SHOUTS and RUNNING FOOTSTEPS draw closer, The Mole lays
        down and begins to die in Kyle's arms.

                             THE MOLE
                   Please... Do not let ze resistance die...

        Gentle MUSIC begins.

                             THE MOLE
                   Now the light, she fades
                   And darkness closes in
                   But I will find strength
                   I will find pride within
                   Because although I die
                   Our freedom will be won
                   Though I die
                   Ze Resistance
                   Lives on...

        The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood.

                             THE MOLE
                   It's so very cold...

                             KYLE
                   We can't leave without you!

                             THE MOLE
                   It's okay, I am done for.

                             KYLE
                   No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU -
                   we don't know where the hell we are!!

        The Mole coughs up more blood.

                             THE MOLE
                   Where is your God when you need him?
                   Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot
                   now?

        The Mole dies.

                             KYLE
                   SHIT!

                             VOICE
                   FREEZE!!

        The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at
        them.

        Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed.

                             KYLE
                   Run, Stan!!

        One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan
        disappears into the night.

                             PENTAGON GUY
                   Forget him! The night will swallow him
                   up.

                             MARINE
                   You are under arrest!  Cuff 'em!

                             KYLE
                   What?

                             PENTAGON
                   So THIS must be the resistance the
                   pentagon has been tracking!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh, son of a bitch...

        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

        Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of MAC, take the stage
        again.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And now, for our big finale, the MOMENT
                   YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!

        Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage.

                             TERRANCE
                   Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.

                             PHILLIP
                   I know, Terrance.  This is quite the
                   shitstorm we've found ourselves in this
                   time.

        From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of
        official looking military people.  The crowd cheers.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   It is my pleasure to present to you, THE
                   EXECUTION OF TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!

        The crowd cheers.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   Strap them in!

        Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the EXECUTIONER,
        donned in a black hood.

        The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and
        puts them into electric chairs.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   Today is a great day for democracy!

        The crowd cheers.

        The Executioner steps up to the throw switch.

                             TERRANCE
                   Phillip, this is worse than that trip to
                   Quebec City when I fell asleep in that
                   disco.

                             PHILLIP
                   I know, Terrance. I know.

        EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

        LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area.

        It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness
        looking tired and scared.

                             STAN
                   Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody
                   here?

        A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on.

                             STAN
                   MARCO!!!

        No answer.

                             STAN
                   MARCO!!!

        No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.

                             STAN
                   Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...

        Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and
        his head smacks against a rock.

        Stan is out cold.

        Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating
        WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his
        flashlight around.

                             STAN
                   What is that?

        The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on
        something that is huge and throbbing.

                             STAN
                   OH MY GOD!!!

        EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

        Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   Gentlemen, do you have any last words?

                             PHILLIP
                   Last words? Let's see... How aboot "GET
                   ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS CHAIR". How's
                   that for last words?

        Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   WAIT!!

        General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   We have just captured some Canadian
                   Sympathizers!

        The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We will execute them along with Terrance
                   and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!

        Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is,
        until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at
        gunpoint.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Kyle?!

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Eric?

                             KYLE
                   Hi, ma.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   We also have a Canadian SPY who was
                   hiding out in South Park!!

        Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Ike?!

        Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   General... These are OUR CHILDREN!

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   They are Canadian sympathizers and they
                   must be dealt with accordingly!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   But they're CHILDREN!

        Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped
        into their chairs.

                             CARTMAN
                   Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I
                   get your autographs?!

                             TERRANCE
                   Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're
                   killed.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   We can't kill these kids!

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that
                   started all this. Don't get all emotional
                   NOW!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   But we're doing all this to help our
                   children's futures!

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Yes, I think shooting our children would
                   adversely affect their futures.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   No... The General is right.

                             KYLE
                   MOM!!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Boobie... This is the only way you're
                   ever going to learn. I have an
                   opportunity here to teach you about
                   consequences.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Sheila, you're going to far! Those are
                   YOUR children!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO
                   BE RUINED BY SMUT!!
                       (To Kyle)
                   I am sorry young man, but I have had it
                   up to here! STRAP THEM IN!

        She walks away.

                             KYLE
                   YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR
                   LANGUAGE!!

        EXT. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

        Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE,
        pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files.
        It's the size of a small building.

        The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.

                             BIG THING
                   Be not afraid...

        Stan trembles.

                             STAN
                       (Weakly)
                   What...

                             BIG THING
                   Behold my glory.

                             STAN
                   What... are you?

                             BIG THING
                   I am the clitoris.

        Stan's eyes grow wide. MUSIC starts to swell up.

                             STAN
                   The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE
                   CLITORIS!!

                             BIG THING
                   Stan, your friends need you. They are in
                   trouble and you must help them.

                             STAN
                   Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to
                   get Wendy to like me.

                             BIG THING
                   There are more important matters right
                   now...

                             STAN
                   NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR
                   YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO
                   GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!

                             BIG THING
                   Dude, she's eight years old, just get her
                   some ice cream or something.

                             STAN
                   Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!

                             BIG THING
                   Now go, your friends are in danger... The
                   USO show is a mile east of here, just
                   over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

        The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La
        Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are
        with them as well.

                             WENDY
                   Stan! Stan are you okay?!

                             STAN
                   Wendy?

                             GREGORY
                   I see you failed in your mission.
                   Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.

        Wendy bends down to pick up Stan.

                             WENDY
                   Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The
                   Canadian forces are about to attack!!

        Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around
        her.

        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

        A drummer plays as the execution begins.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!!
                   Throw the switch!!!

        The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip
        start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look
        horrified.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Goodbye, bastards!

        Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and
        Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.

                             TERRANCE
                   Take that, bitch.

        As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:

                             PHILLIP/TERRANCE
                   FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!

        Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the
        army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead
        bodies in all directions.

        Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale
        attack!!

        From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs
        in every direction.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR
                   YOUR LIVES!!

        FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion!  Everybody just starts
        screaming and shooting in every direction.  Total and
        complete mayhem.

        One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and
        Phillip stop drying.

        The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and
        right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.

                             KYLE
                   CARTMAN!

                             CARTMAN
                       (Frying)
                   WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!

                             PHILLIP
                   What's going on Terrance?

                             TERRANCE
                   Canada is saving us!!

        Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle
        picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.

        INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM

        Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his
        cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.

                             SATAN
                       (Whispering)
                   Have you finished?

        Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He
        holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last
        drops underneath the bed.

                             KENNY
                   Mph mph.

                             SATAN
                   Then move out of the way.

        Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of
        matches.

                             SATAN
                   I must be strong... I must be strong...

        Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.

                             SATAN
                   Damn it...

        Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-

                             SATAN
                   Goodbye, Saddam...

        -and throws it onto the bed.

                             SATAN
                   Come on!

        Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.

        EXT. USO SHOW - DAY

        People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack
        has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all
        around.

                             JIMBO
                   Ned!  Behind you!

        Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one
        Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through
        Ned's neck.

        Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.

                             JIMBO
                   NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!

        FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst
        the explosions.

                             CARTMAN
                   HOLY SHIT!
                       (Zap)
                   AGHAGHGAH!!

        Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the
        blue current swirl around his body.

                             CARTMAN
                   HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!

        General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where
        explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie
        talkie as his men die all around him.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   ALRIGHT MEN!!!  FALL INTO FORMATION!
                   "HUMAN SHIELD" UP FRONT THEN "OPERATION
                   GET BEHIND THE DARKIES"!!!

        They all fall in.  A phalanx of black men, Chef included in
        them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!  PROTECT OUR
                   TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!

        Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian
        tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.  Behind them is
        a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Holy Mother of Johosephat...

        The black guys all look at each other nervously.

        EXT. BATTLEFIELD

        The boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly
        here and there.

        A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the
        boys holding a massive head wound.

                             KYLE
                   Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!

        Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get
                   him out of here...

        Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman.

        Just then, Garrison goes limp.

        Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys
        run from the battle.

        They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are
        standing in a human shield around the white guys.

                             CHEF
                   Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU...
                   ONE!!

        The Canadian tanks take aim.

                             CHEF
                   TWO!

        The Canadian tanks fire.

                             CHEF
                   THREE!!

        All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the
        whites completely exposed.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   What the-

        The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers
        to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.

                             BLACK SOLDIER
                   GREAT PLAN, CHEF!

                             CHEF
                   Operation Human Shield my ASS!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

        From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both
        sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be
        heard in the distance.

        We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.  He
        shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.  He wounds one and
        then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Die Canadian, mmkay?!

        And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.

        But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of
        nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay-

        Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs
        through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around
        gunfire.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going
                   FAST!!!

        Another bullet zings by his head.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!

        THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More
        bullets follow, tearing him to shreds.

        WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE

        This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private
        Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters,
        gunfire and death.

        Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a
        ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   My God... This is terrible...

        Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely
        insane.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This is what we wanted! We wanted our
                   children to be brought up in a smut-free
                   environment!!!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   But we didn't want THIS. I just followed
                   you 'cause I made a shitload of money
                   selling Kenny t-shirts!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh Lord, what have we done...?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Wake up, people!  We all have to do
                   things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's
                   the not pretty things that make life
                   worth fighting the not pretty things for!
                   Why do you think children have to be born
                   in hospitals?

        The other mothers look very confused.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect
                   plan!!  Perfect!  Perfect! Perfect!!!!!

        The other mothers walk away.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the
                   not pretty things from letting our
                   children be born in hospitals!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   We're going to find our boys! For God's
                   sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!

        Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and
        explosions.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Killed.  They should only be so lucky.
                   Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!

        She charges the field.

        EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

        Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud
        explosions.

                             PHILLIP
                   Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!

                             TERRANCE
                   You did? Just now?

        They laugh merrily.

                             PHILLIP
                   Come on, we can take shelter in one of
                   those buildings!

        But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY
                   FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!

        Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother
        plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.

                             TERRANCE
                   AGH!

                             PHILLIP
                   Terrance! NO!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   DIE!!!!!!

        SLOW MOTION SHOT -

        Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach.

        Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down,
        down...

        Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!!

        CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes.

        CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground...

        BACK TO REAL TIME

        Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames
        and ash take over the sky.

        Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops
        fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.

                             SATAN
                   RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!

        Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on
        both sides can't believe what they're seeing.

        Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off
        and looks around.

        EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT

        As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike
        huddle close to each other in a trench.

                             CARTMAN
                   Kyle... All those times I said you were a
                   big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're
                   not a Jew.

        Kyle thinks.

                             KYLE
                   Yes I am!

                             IKE
                   Baba mama!

        Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the
        boys' heads.

                             CARTMAN
                   AGH!
                       (Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand)
                   What the hell am I still holding this
                   for?!

        Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS
        and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Mr. Hat! Noooooo!

        Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench.

                             KYLE
                   Stan!

                             STAN
                   Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can
                   get Wendy to like me now!

                             KYLE
                   Sweet.

                             CARTMAN
                       (Sarcastic)
                   Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's
                   well that ends well, huh? We can go home
                   now. There's just one little thing left
                   to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!

        More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys.

        Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys.

                             CARTMAN/KYLE
                   AGAGAH!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to
                   take us to the netherworld!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rmph rmph?!

                             KYLE
                   Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying
                   to tell us something!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

                             CARTMAN
                   Okay!  We can get you some proofs of
                   purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!  Just
                   mellow the heck out!

        EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

        More battle. People are dying left and right.

        The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A
        Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows
        the Canadian's head clean off.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Hey, pal, don't lose your head.

        Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead,
        and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled
        shotgun.

                             CANADIAN SOLDIER
                   I'm glad you got that off your chest.

        Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian
        through the head with his bayonet.

                             TOM
                   I guess he got the point.

        A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes.

                             CANADIAN SOLDIER 2
                   Plastics are a cheap and efficient
                   insulator for electrical applications.

        Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush
        in.

                             SATAN
                   Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!

        The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.

                             SATAN
                   You're all part of Satan's army now!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What the hell is going on?!

        Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face.

                             SATAN
                   I am the dark master!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I
                   don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!

                             SATAN
                   SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh.

                             SATAN
                   YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE
                   INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME...
                   NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF
                   DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!

        Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.

                             CHEF
                   Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a
                   lot.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I... I was just trying to make the world
                   a better place for children...

                             SATAN
                   Yes... And in doing so, you brought
                   enough anger and intolerance to the world
                   to allow my coming.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And I thought my mother was the master of
                   guilt.  Geez Louise.

                             SATAN
                   SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO
                   ME!!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh God... What have I done...

        One by one, the soldiers start to kneel.

        Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible,
        deep laugh that fills the world.

        But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to
        the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another
        figure.

        He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini
        glass in his hand.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, I'm missing the party!

                             SATAN
                   No! It can't be!

        Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his
        ass.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Did you miss me, buttercup?
                       (Yelling out)
                   All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!
                   Everyone bow down to ME!!

        Satan puts his head down.

                             KYLE
                   HOLD EVERYTHING!!!

        Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.

                             KYLE
                   You made a deal with Kenny that if he got
                   ten proofs of purchases from Snacky
                   Smores you'd grant him any wish.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   And?

        Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC
        plays.

                             SATAN
                   I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking
                   with him!

                             KYLE
                   What?

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   The deal's off, go away, guy.

                             SATAN
                   No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't
                   just renege on a deal. That's lying.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not
                   hear okay?

        Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he
        sits down like a good little bitch.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Now, let's start torturing people, shall
                   we? We'll start with...
                       (Looks at Cartman)
                   THIS little fat kid first!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AY!  Don't call me fat, buttfucker-

        ZAP!!  A huge CHARGE shoots from Cartman, knocking one of
        hell's demons on his ass.

                             STAN
                   Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!

                             CARTMAN
                   How the fuck should I know!!

        ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside
        Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling.

                             KYLE
                   Look at that!

                             CHEF
                   It's that v-chip thing that's inside you,
                   Eric!  The polarity must have been
                   reversed by the electric chair!

                             TERRANCE
                   Oh boy!

        A smile comes across Cartman's face.

                             CARTMAN
                   BUTTFUCKING SHIT!

        BZZZZZZZZT!   A huge charge busts the chains that hold
        Cartman's wrists.

        He jumps down.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yes!

        TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays as Cartman uses his newly found power.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Quick, Satan!  Do something!

        But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands
        and lets loose.

                             CARTMAN
                   FUCK A HUNK A SHIT, YOU RAT FUCK!!!

        BZZZZZZZZZAAT!!!!  A charge hits Satan square between the
        eyes and knocks him down.

        He gets to his knees and stands up again.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!

                             CARTMAN
                   Try this on for size-

        Cartman holds up his hands.

                             CARTMAN
                   DRIPPING VAGINA EATING SON OF A
                   PIGFUCKING CRACK WHORE!!! HAIRY COCK
                   SLURPING MAGGOT FUUUUUCK!!!!

        BZZZAAAAT!!

        The charge hits Saddam in the chest.  He drops again.

        Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.  He appeals to
        Cartman.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey buddy!  No need to stress! Let me
                   make you a deal!  How about a lifetime
                   supply of Snacky Smores and we just
                   forget about this whole thing?!

                             KYLE
                   Don't listen to him, Cartman!

                             KENNY
                   Mrphmmmph!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   (giving in)  Okay.  (then)  Not.

        Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the
        worst words in the world.

        Then, it comes out.  Like a volcano.

                             CARTMAN
                   SUCK THE HOT SHIT FROM MY GURGLING ASS
                   YOU BLOOD DRENCHED FROZEN TAMPON ON A
                   STIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!!

        A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and
        joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam.  Saddam is
        thrown back against the wall.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                       (To Satan)
                   What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy
                   him!!

        Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks...

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save
                   me!!

        Satan stands there.

                             SATAN
                   Help you? You've destroyed my life and
                   now you want me to help you?!  You're
                   always making me feel like a piece of
                   shit.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Come on guy, you know I only rib you
                   because I love you so much!

                             SATAN
                   If you love somebody then you treat them
                   with respect!  You've never respected me!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Can we talk about this later?  Everyone
                   is watching!

                             SATAN
                   I don't care!  I want to talk about it
                   now!

        Saddam grabs Satan by the arm.

                             SATAN
                   Ow, you're hurting me!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Listen guy, you're embarassing me in
                   front of my friends!  You know how I get
                   mad when I get embarassed.

        Satan starts getting really mad.  Steam starts coming from
        his nostrils.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Your little problems can wait til later,
                   see?

        Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Now do what I say and keep your fucking
                   mouth shut!

                             SATAN
                   THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!

        Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming
        cliff, back into the depths of hell.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy
                   guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx.....

                             CHEF
                   Saddam Hussein is dead!

                             STAN AND KYLE
                   Hooray!!!

        Everyone cheers.

                             PHILLIP
                   You're quite a purveyor of filth, little
                   boy!

                             TERRANCE
                   Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of
                   words!

                             CARTMAN
                   Well, I learned it all from you guys.

                             PHILLIP
                   Of course you did, cock fuck!

        They all laugh merrily.

        Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam
        fell.

                             SATAN
                   He spent so much time convincing me I was
                   weak and stupid that I believed it
                   myself.

        The boys look at each other, confused.

                             SATAN
                   Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted
                   was sex.  But it took me so long to
                   figure that out.

        He starts to cry.  Chef hands him a hanky.

                             CHEF
                   Here you go Satan-

                             SATAN
                   Thank you. Give me the proofs of
                   purchases.

        Kenny hands them to Satan.

                             SATAN
                   Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any
                   wish you want is yours.

        TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny
        speaks.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.

        Everyone GASPS!!

                             KYLE
                   WHAT?

                             STAN
                   Are you sure, Kenny?

                             SATAN
                   What did he say?

                             STAN
                   He said that his wish is for everyone who
                   died in the war to come back.

                             CHEF
                   Kenny, you realize this wish is the only
                   chance for YOU not to be dead...

                             KENNY
                   M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm.
                   Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.

        Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand,
        important speech.

                             SATAN
                   Very well, then. I will put an end to the
                   war as your wish and make everything as
                   it was before the war started. But you
                   Kenny, must remain dead.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rm.

        Satan turns to the open abyss.

                             SATAN
                   I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's
                   too fucking cold up here.

                             STAN
                   Aren't there cold parts of hell?

                             SATAN
                   Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's
                   the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm
                   destined to live in hell... alone...

        Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But
        something catches his eye.

                             SATAN
                   Hello... What's this?

        Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and
        then places it gently on his hand.

                             SATAN
                   Hi there, little guy... Would you like to
                   go to hell with me?

                             SATAN (AS MR. HAT)
                   Sure. I bet we can be best friends!

        Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.

        The boys walks over to Kenny.

                             KYLE
                   Thank you, Kenny.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for
                   us. You're a real pal.

        A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are
        dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.

        At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others
        who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at
        themselves, wondering what just happened.

        Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and
        Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Wow... We were all killed and now we're
                   fine. That's super!

                             KYLE
                   Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, but you know, I learned something
                   today.  I learned that getting all worked
                   up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is
                   just stupid... You all focused so hard on
                   erasing profanity that you forgot the
                   most important thing... To love each
                   other.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a
                   bitches!

        The boys' parents walk up.

                             STAN
                   Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going
                   to have fun with profanity just like you
                   and dad did when you were little.

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or
                   dicksucker or, or-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Shiteater-

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   -Or monkey fucker-

        They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness.

        Wendy walks up to Stan.

                             WENDY
                   I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get
                   it after all!

        Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.

                             STAN
                   Wendy... How would you like to go get
                   some ice cream?

                             WENDY
                   Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
                   cream?

                             STAN
                   My friend the clitoris told me.

                             WENDY
                   Wow, I have a clitoris too.

                             STAN
                   Really? Where the hell do you keep it?
                   It's huge.

        Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits
        into Wendy's mouth.

                             STAN
                   But Wendy... What about Gregory?

        Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.

                             WENDY
                   Stan, I never cared for Gregory.

                             STAN
                   You didn't?

                             WENDY
                   No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

                             STAN
                   Cool!

                             WENDY
                       (Singing)
                   Thank my lucky stars
                   Here before me now
                   Is everything I'd ever hoped for-

                             STAN
                   Knew it in a word
                   Saw it in a glance
                   The only thing I think I'd die for

                             STAN AND WENDY
                   I can't stop now... My heart's
                   awake!
                   I pray your arms my arms to take!
                   So this is why I'm alive!

        Now everyone joins hands and starts singing-

                             EVERYONE
                   SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!
 YOU'RE A COCK SUCKING ASS RAPING UNCLEFUCKA! YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S TRUE! NOBODY FUCKS UNCLES QUITE LIKE YOU!                    UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!

        Kenny's mom and dad come up.

                             KENNY'S DAD
                   This is all so wonderful.  I just wish
                   our little Kenny could see all of this
                   joy.

                             KYLE
                   Oh he can, dude.  Look!

        Kyle points to the sky.  Everyone looks up just in time to
        see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.

        We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.
        As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting
        towards the heavens.
   
        As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and
        up through the clouds. (NOTE:  This will also be done in 3-D
        CGI)

        Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into
        the warmth of the baby blueness.

        Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.  They smile
        gently.  He feels calm.  He feels good.

        Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...
        into Heaven.

                                                                  END.

        FADE IN:

        Very happy, Disneyesque MUSIC swirls in.

        PAN DOWN from a pretty blue sky, to a small quaint town
        nestled in the hills. A wooden sign tells us this is South
        Park.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Birds fly into the air, TOWNSPEOPLE smile to each other as
        they walk by.

        It is a scene reminiscent of, if not directly ripped off
        from, the opening number of 'Beauty and the Beast'.

        A little eight year old boy walks happily down the street. He
        is STAN MARSH, a noble looking boy with piercing blue eyes
        and a strong chin. As he walks, he sings a happy song.

                             STAN
                   I'm going to the movies
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movie
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget all my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how I should view the world
                   Where everything works out
                   I love it that way
                   I'm going to the movies
                   The movies today!

        Stan merrily walks up to a crappy looking house.

        INT. BEDROOM - MORNING

        We are in a young boy's bedroom, just as his alarm clock goes
        off. BRRRRRTTT!!!

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER
                   Good morning South Park! It's five-thirty
                   a.m. on Sunday!! Time to feed the horses
                   and water the cows!!

        From the back, we see the blond haired kid sit up from his
        bed. He stretches, and then walks over to his closet.

        We still only see the boy from the back as he reaches in his
        closet and pulls out an orange coat.

        The kid puts his coat on, then turns to camera and pulls the
        hood shut, so that we never get a good look at his face.

                             MOTHER (O.S.)
                   KENNY! YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR CHURCH!!!

        This boy's name is KENNY, and under his orange coat, we have
        no idea what he looks like, except for his European nose and
        hazel eyes.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

        INT. KENNY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN

        Kenny walks through his small, dirty house and into the
        kitchen, where his MOTHER, FATHER and OLDER BROTHER are
        sitting at the humble table.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Sit down, you can share some of your
                   brother's waffle.

        The doorbell rings. Kenny walks over to the door.

        EXT. KENNY'S HOUSE - DAY

        Kenny opens the door to find Stan.

                             STAN
                   Kenny! The Terrance and Phillip movie is
                   out! You wanna come?!

        Stan shows Kenny a newspaper clipping. It's an ad for the new
        Terrance and Phillip movie 'Asses of fire'. Kenny's eyes
        light up.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm, rmph!

        Kenny walks away with Stan. His mother comes out after him.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Kenny! Where're you going?

                             KENNY
                   Mph mprh mprh rm!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   What do you mean you don't want to go to
                   church?

                             KENNY
                   Mrmph, rmph rmph rm rmph.

        Kenny and Stan walk down the street.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Well fine, go ahead and miss church!! And
                   then when you die and go to hell you can
                   ANSWER TO SATAN!!

        Dramatic MUSIC STING. Kenny stops, thinks for a minute... And
        then walks off with Stan anyway.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Stan and Kenny now both happily march down the street to the
        happy beat.

        TOM, a plastic surgeon, peeps his head out the door of his
        Rhinoplasty office.

                             TOM
                   Say, where are you boys going?

                             STAN
                   We're going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   Where everyone is beautiful
                   And have their hair combed just
                   right!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm!
                   Mph rm rmph rm!
                   Mprh rm rmph rm rm
                   Rmph rm rmph rm rmph!

                             TOM
                   Have fun you rascals!

        EXT. KYLE'S HOUSE - DAY

        Kenny and Stan knock at the door.

        A handsome eight year old Semite, KYLE, answers the door.

                             KYLE
                   Hey, dudes... Aren't you supposed to go
                   to church, Kenny?

                             STAN
                   Kyle, check it out.

        Kenny holds up the newspaper clipping.

                             KYLE
                   OH MY GOD, DUDE!!!

        Kyle slips on his coat and heads out the door. But just then,
        Kyle's little brother, IKE, a two year old adopted Canadian
        boy bounces up next to him.

                             KYLE
                   No, Ike! You can't come with me!

        Kyle's MOTHER, a big fat bitch, comes to the door and yells.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Kyle, you take your little brother out to
                   play with you!

                             KYLE
                   Aw, ma!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Do as I say, Kyle!

        Kyle's mother closes the door.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it!!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Now the three boys, and little Ike, merrily strut down the
        street and sing in unison.

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies
                   To see the better side of life
                   Where something interesting happens
                   Every day and night!

                             KYLE
                   In movies we can pretend
                   That love is real
                   and good always wins-

                             STAN
                   We can even make believe marriages
                   last!

        A HOMELESS guy is lying in the alley.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Spare a dollar? Spare a dollar?

        Stan walks by and throws a dollar at him. The homeless guy
        suddenly jumps up.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   I'm going to the movies!
                   To see the brighter side of life!
                   I'm going to the movies
                   Everything's gonna be alright!
                   Forget my troubles
                   Put my own life on hold
                   Let a studio tell me
                   how to view the world!

                             KYLE
                   Let's go get fat ass!

        EXT. ANOTHER HOUSE - DAY

        This house looks just like all the others.

        INT. THAT SAME HOUSE

        CLOSE UP on a bag that reads 'CHEESY POOFS'. A hand reaches
        into the bag, pulls out a wad of orange crunchies and raises
        them --

        BOOM UP to reveal the fat face of eight year old ERIC CARTMAN
        who chows down on the chips.

        Now we see that fat little Eric is sitting on his couch,
        eating Cheesy Poofs and watching television.

        The doorbell rings. Cartman doesn't move a muscle.

                             CARTMAN
                   MOM! SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR!

        CARTMAN'S MOTHER enters. She is extremely June Cleaveresque
        (except that she's a hermaphrodite crack whore). She returns
        with Stan, Kyle and Kenny.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Look, Eric it's your little friends.

                             CARTMAN
                   What the hell are you guys doing here?

                             IKE
                   Baba turtre bad!

        Kyle holds up the newspaper ad.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ooh!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE

        Now all four boys are merrily walking down the street and
        singing.

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies
                   To see the better side of life!

                             CARTMAN
                   Maybe there'll be pirates!
                   Or a whole city burnin'!
                   Maybe we'll see a monster
                   Or, better yet, Uma Thurman!

                             BOYS
                   We're going to the movies!
                   Everything's gonna be okay!

        The boys skip out of frame.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The movie theatre is nestled neatly between two other South
        Park buildings.

        The boys walk up to the geeky, teenage TICKET GUY.

                             BOYS
                   Going to the movies!
                   The movies today!!!!!

                             STAN
                   Can I get five tickets to Terrance and
                   Phillip Asses of Fire, please?

                             TICKET GUY
                   No.

        Suddenly, all the happy music that has permeated the film
        comes to an ABRUPT HALT.

        The boys look confused.

                             KYLE
                   What'dya mean, no?

                             TICKET GUY
                   Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire is
                   rated 'R'. You kids can't get in.

        The boys look shocked. They just stand there, in silence.

                             CARTMAN
                   The hell we can't! My money is just as
                   good as any white person's!

                             TICKET GUY
                   You have to be accompanied by a parent or
                   guardian.

                             KYLE
                   But why?

                             TICKET GUY
                   Because this movie has naughty language,
                   and it might make you kids start using
                   bad words.

                             CARTMAN
                   Listen you son of a bitch, if you don't
                   let us in to see this movie I'm gonna
                   kick you square in the nuts.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Sorry, Charlie.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it!

                             TICKET GUY
                   Next, please?

        A few TEENAGERS walk up to get their tickets. The boys step
        aside.

                             STAN
                   This is terrible! This can't be
                   happening!!

                             KYLE
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude!

                             CARTMAN
                   Aw, screw it. It probably isn't all that
                   good anyway.

                             KYLE
                   Cartman! What the hell are you talking
                   about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it
                   probably can't sustain itself over ninety
                   minutes.

                             IKE
                   Poo baba!

                             STAN
                   Wait! I've got an idea!

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - A LITTLE LATER

        The old Homeless guy from the intro song walks up to the
        Ticket Guy with the boys.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Uh, hi. I want five tickets to Terrance
                   and Phillip Asses of Fire.

                             TICKET GUY
                   You realize this movie is rated R? It may
                   not be appropriate for your little ones.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Oh.
                       (Turning to boys)
                   Hey, he says this movie isn't appropriate
                   for you.

                             STAN
                       (Whispering)
                   Look, homeless guy, if you don't want to
                   buy us tickets, and NOT get your ten
                   bucks and NOT go buy yourself a bottle of
                   Vodka and not forget about how miserable
                   your life is and not stop the voices in
                   your head then go right ahead.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Five tickets please.

        The Ticket guy suspiciously hands them over.

        INT. MOVIE THEATER - DAY

        The boys are all sitting in the front row. Cartman has a huge
        tub of popcorn, all kinds of candy, and a large drink.

                             IKE
                   Purpre mama!

                             KYLE
                   Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!

        ANGLE - MOVIE SCREEN

        A TITLE reads 'Terrance and Phillip - Asses of Fire'

                             BOYS
                   HOORAY!!!

        On the screen, we come across PHILLIP, a very handsome
        Canadian star with a great body.

                             PHILLIP
                   Say Terrance, what did the Spanish Priest
                   say to the Uranian gynecologist?

        PAN OVER to TERRANCE, who is also Canadian, and equally
        handsome in a more rugged way.

                             TERRANCE
                   I don't know, Phillip, what?

        Phillip rips a big fart. Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        ANGLE - BOYS

        Laughing their asses off.

                             KYLE
                   That was sweet!

                             STAN
                   Where do they come up with this stuff?!

                             CARTMAN
                   How come Terrance and Phillip are so
                   weird looking?

                             KYLE
                   Cuz, dummy they're Canadian, just like
                   Ike!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh.

                             IKE
                   Poo bada!

        ANGLE - SCREEN

                             TERRANCE
                   You're such a pigfucker, Phillip!

                             PHILLIP
                   What?! Why would you call me a
                   pigfucker?!

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck
                   pigs.

                             PHILLIP
                   Oh yeah!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        ANGLE - BOYS

                             KYLE
                   Woa, dude! Did they say what I think they
                   said?

        ANGLE - SCREEN

        Terrance pulls out a white envelope.

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, fuck my ass and call me a bitch, I
                   just got a letter!

                             PHILLIP
                   A letter from who, you shit sucking cock
                   master?

        TRACK IN on the boys' wide eyed faces as the dialogue from
        the film enters their innocent ears.

                             TERRANCE
                   It's from your mother.

                             PHILLIP
                   My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it
                   say?

                             TERRANCE
                   It says 'Dear Terrance, please don't ever
                   tell my son that I licked your hairy
                   balls.'

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                             PHILLIP
                   Oh, you fucking ball whore!

        The boys don't laugh, they just smile widely, they seem busy
        taking it all in.

                             CARTMAN
                   Wow... Ball whore...

                             TERRANCE

        The song ends and the boys erupt into applause.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The boys walk out of the theatre with glazed eyes and wide
        smiles.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!

                             CARTMAN

                   Hey wait a minute... Where's your
                   guardian?

                             STAN
                   Huh?

                             TICKET GUY
                   I knew it! You PAID a homeless guy to get
                   you in, didn't you!

        The boys think a second.

                             CARTMAN
                   Suck my balls.

                             KYLE

                   Shut your fucking face,
                   Unclefucka!!

        The boys walk away, merrily. The ticket guy is in shock.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Oh oh, I'm in trouble.

                             BOYS
                       (Singing, fading off)
                   You're an asslicking, ball sucking

        EXT. STARK'S POND - DAY

        All the children of South Park are gathered at the pond for
        ice skating.

        The scene is reminiscent of the skating scene from the
        Charlie Brown Christmas special.

        Delicate snowflakes fall, children laugh and skate, and
        joyous music plays.

        The boys walk up to the pond.

                             CLYDE
                   Hey, where have you guys been all day?

                             STAN
                   Oh, nowhere... We just went out to go see
                   the TERRANCE AND PHILLIP MOVIE!

        All the kids gasp! Dramatic MUSIC STING.

                             BEBE
                   You saw it?!

                             CLYDE
                   How'd you get in?!

        Suddenly, all the kids are gathered around the boys. They're
        like celebrities.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey! Stop crowding us you shitfaced
                   cockmasters!

        All the kids stop, wide eyed. As if they've just hear the
        voice of God.

                             KIDS
                   Wowwww...

                             STAN
                   Yeah, you're all a bunch of ass ramming
                   unclefuckers.

                             KIDS
                   Ooooohhh!!!

                             CLYDE
                        (To another kid)
                   We HAVE to see this movie, dude.

        The other kids nod.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey Stan, tell 'em about when Terrance
                   called Phillip a testicle shitting rectal
                   wart! Stan? Stan?

        But Stan is elsewhere, because out on the ice, skating
        gracefully, is little eight year old WENDY TESTABURGER.

        The heavens part, a CHOIR OF ANGELS sing, as Wendy skates
        around and around, performing a series of impossible Triple
        Lutzes, Sowcows and what-have-you-not's.

        All the animals of the forest -- deer, birds, bunnies -- all
        stop to admire her.

        Stan's smile grows wider and wider. Kyle turns to see what
        he's looking at.

                             STAN
                   Thank my lucky stars
                   Here before me now
                   Is everything I'd ever hoped for
                   Knew it in a word
                   Saw it in a glance
                   The only thing I think I'd die
                   for...

                             KYLE
                   Aw, God Damn it, he's singing that
                   fucking song again.

        ANGLE - WENDY

        Spinning and soaring in slo-mo.  Effortlessly covering every
        inch of the pond with her ballet maneuvers.

        Stan is slack-jawed.

                             STAN
                   I can't stop now
                   My heart's awake
                   I pray her arms
                   my arms to take
                   So this is why I'm ali-

        Wendy finishes her routine with a triumphant Hamill-camel
        landing right in front of Stan and spraying ice in his face
        and abruptly ending his song.

                             WENDY
                   Hi, Stan!

        Stan vomits profusely all over himself.

                             WENDY
                   Ew! Gross!

        Just then, another kid skates up, spraying more ice in Stan's
        face. His name is GREGORY, and he is a very handsome eight
        year old boy, with golden hair and an open-buttoned shirt. He
        speaks with a rich English accent.

                             GREGORY
                   Come, Wendy, let us try to jump the hilly
                   brush.

        Stan looks at Gregory.

                             STAN
                   Who are you, kid?

                             GREGORY
                   My name is Gregory. I have been Wendy's
                   counter-cousin for some time.

                             WENDY
                   Want to skate with us?

                             GREGORY
                   We've been skating all morning. And
                   laughing and talking of memories past.

        Gregory skates away. Stan looks stunned. Finally, he tries to
        get Wendy's attention.

                             STAN
                   We saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                             WENDY
                   That's nice, Stan.

        Wendy skates after Gregory. Stan looks completely rejected.

                             KYLE
                   Woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new
                   guy?

                             STAN
                   She's not my girlfriend, dude!

        Meanwhile, the schoolkids are all still gathered around
        Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yes, I saw the Terrance and Phillip
                   movie. Who wants to touch me?  I said,
                   "Who wants to touch me?!"

        A small boy steps forward and tentatively touches Cartman's
        arm.

                             SMALL BOY
                   Oooooh...

        EXT. SOUTH PARK - TOWN - MORNING

        Establishing shot of the little town of South Park which
        consists of four buildings. The sun rises in the background.

        It's a brand new day.

        EXT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        The elementary school is nestled peacefully between two
        mountain peaks.

        INT. SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        The kids of South Park are all in their seats, singing.

                             KIDS
                   Shut your fucking face,
                   Unclefucka!!
                   You're a shitsucking, cocksucking
                   Unclefucka!!

        The door opens, and suddenly the kids quiet down.

        CLOSE-UP on a hand puppet with a large red hat. It seems to
        be speaking.

                             MR. HAT
                   Okay, children, let's take our seats.

        As the voice continues, we PULL BACK to reveal that the
        puppet is on the right hand of MR. GARRISON, a forty-six year
        old teacher who is in denial about his homosexuality.

                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
                   We have a lot to learn and precious
                   little time.

        Garrison looks over the class and notices that every single
        one of them is wearing a Terrance and Phillip T-shirt,
        except, of course, for Wendy.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Why is everyone wearing T-shirts of
                   Sigfried and Roy?

                             KYLE
                   It's not Sigried and Roy, Mr. Garrison,
                   it's Terrance and Phillip.

                             KIDS
                   TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!

        Stan looks over at Wendy. She just rolls her eyes. Stan
        sulks.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Well, anyway... Today children, our
                   friend Mr. Hat is going to tell us all
                   about the environment.

                             MR. GARRISON (AS MR. HAT)
                   That's right, Mr. Garrison. The
                   environment is what surrounds us. It is
                   what we live and breathe.

                             CARTMAN
                   I hate the environment.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, how can you hate the environment?

                             CARTMAN
                   'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and
                   fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.

        The kids all GASP!

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?

                             CARTMAN
                   Fragile?

                             KYLE
                   No, he's talking about fuck, dude. You
                   can't say fuck in front of Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Kyle!

                             CARTMAN
                   Why the fuck not?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Eric!

                             STAN
                   Dude, you just said fuck again.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Stanly!

                             KENNY
                   Mph.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Kenny!

                             CARTMAN
                   That's bullshit! If Terrance and Phillip
                   can say something, I should be able to
                   say it too!

                             BEBE
                   Wow, Cartman's cool!

                             CLYDE
                   He's like Terrance and Phillip!

        Cartman gloats proudly.

                             CARTMAN
                   Fuckin' a right.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   How would you like to go to the
                   principal's office?

                             CARTMAN
                   How would you like to gargle rat jiz?

        Mr. Garrison is in shock.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!

                             CARTMAN
                   I said -

        Cartman takes out a megaphone, hits the switch and puts it
        to his mouth. It feeds back horribly.

                             CARTMAN
                        (Through megaphone)
                   HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO GARGLE RAT JIZ?!

        Garrison is floored.

                             KYLE
                   Oh, dude we are fucked now.

        INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY

        The boys are seated in front of the Principal's desk.

                             STAN
                   Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw
                   the Terrance and Phillip movie!

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!

        Just then, the Principal walks in. She is PRINCIPAL VICTORIA,
        a frizzy haired woman of about forty.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   I am VERY disappointed in you boys!
                   You should be ASHAMED of yourselves! I've
                   already called in your parents, but first
                   I want you to THINK about what you've
                   done.

                              CARTMAN
                   Principal Victoria, can I ask a question?

                             PRINCPAL VICTORIA
                   What?

                             CARTMAN
                   What's the big fucking deal?

                             STAN
                   Yeah.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   AGH!! I want to know where you heard
                   these horrific obscenities!

        The boys look at each other.

                             STAN
                   Nowhere.

                             KYLE
                   I'VE heard them from Mr. Garrison a few
                   times before...

                             STAN
                   Yeah!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Boys, I seriously doubt that Mr. Garrison
                   ever said-
                        (Reading)
                   'Eat penguin shit you cum sucking ass
                   spelunker' in school!

        The boys all laugh.

        But then the door opens and in walks Stan's mother, Kyle's
        mother, Cartman's mother and Kenny's mother.

                             STAN
                   Oh, oh...

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Thank you all for coming on such short
                   notice. As you can see, your boys are all
                   being disciplined.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   This just isn't like you, Stanley!

        Stan looks down at the floor.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What did my son say, Principal Victoria?
                   Did he say the S word?

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   No, it was worse than that...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (Gasping)
                   The F word?!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   No, worse. Here's a short list of the
                   things they've been saying.

        The mothers look over the sheet of paper. Immediately, their
        eyes bulge.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh dear God...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What is 'fisting'?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   That's when the fist is inserted into the
                   anus or vagina for sexual pleasure.

        The two moms stare at Ms. Cartman.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   What?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (To Kyle)
                   Young man, you will tell Peincipal
                   Victoria THIS INSTANT where you heard all
                   these horrible phrases!

                             KYLE
                   I can't dude! We all took a sacred oath,
                   and swore ourselves to secrecy!

                             CARTMAN
                   It was the Terrance and Phllip movie!

                             STAN
                   Dude!

                             CARTMAN
                   What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of
                   here.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt!
                   Not again!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   What is Terrance and Phillip?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Terrance and Phillip are two VERY
                   untalented, unfunny actors from Canada.
                   Their TV show is filled with toilet humor
                   and bad language and is just complete
                   garbage.  Now it appears they have a
                   movie and I'm positive it's not suitable
                   for children!

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Well, it looks like I'll have to send a
                   warning letter out to parents. I have to
                   put a stop to this before MORE children
                   see 'Terrance and Phillip'.

                             CARTMAN
                   Everybody's already fucking seen it.

                             MS. CARTMAN
                   Eric!

                             CARTMAN
                   I'm sorry! I can't help it!! That movie
                   has warped my fragile little mind.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Alright, boys, that's enough. Get out and
                   let us adults speak.

        The boys get up and walk out. Kyle's mother slams the door
        behind them.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We must take action on this immediately.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Ooh yes. I think we'll have to give
                   detention to those boys.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Forgive me for saying so, Principal
                   Victoria, but your methods are too...
                   Shall we say... soft?  As head of the
                   PTA, I am exercising my right under
                   article 42 of the PTA code.

        A look of shock comes over the principal's face.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Article 42!  You don't mean-?!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Yes Principal Victoria.  The PTA is
                   impeaching you.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   But I-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   You are officially relieved of your
                   duties as principal of this school!

        Kyle's mother sits herself down at Principal Victoria's desk.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Get out of that chair! The PTA is in
                   charge now!

        INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

        The other school kids are in line for lunch.

        Just then, the Kyle's mother's voice comes blaring through
        the P.A.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Attention students. We are now enforcing
                   a new dress code at South Park
                   Elementary. Terrance and Phillip shirts
                   are NO LONGER ALLOWED IN SCHOOL. Anyone
                   wearing a Terrance and Phillip shirt is
                   to be SENT HOME IMMEDIATELY.

        The kids look down. They're all wearing Terrance and Phillip
        shirts.

                             KIDS
                   HOOORAY!!!

        The kids all cheer and run out the door. Leaving the
        cafeteria absolutely empty... Except for Wendy.

                             WENDY
                   Hello?

        Wendy's hello echoes throughout the entire building.

                   All over America, kids are flocking to
                   the R rated film, 'Terrance and Phillip
                   Asses of Fire'. Here with a special
                   report, is a quadriplegic midget in a
                   bikini.

        INT. SPELLING BEE - DAY

        A QUADRIPLEGIC MIDGET IN A BIKINI stands in front of the
        camera with a microphone.

                             Q. MIDGET W/BIKINI
                   Thanks, Tom. It appears that the effects
                   of the Canadian Comedy are far reaching
                   indeed. All over America, children seem
                   to be influenced.

         A TEACHER is on stage with a young spelling bee contestant.

                   Oh, fuck that, why should I fucking have
                   to spell forensics?

        All the kids cheer.

        EXT. BIRTHDAY PARTY - DAY

        A happy birthday party is going on is some kids backyard. A
        clown is entertaining everyone.

                             CLOWN
                   Hey kids, how would you like to see some
                   magic tricks?!

                             KIDS
                   FUCK YOU!!

        The clown looks startled.

                             CLOWN
                   Huh?

                             CHILD
                   Yeah, and fuck your stupid little red
                   nose.

                             CHILD 2
                   Yeah, and fuck your yellow hair. And fuck
                   your gay pants.

        PAN OVER to again find the midget reporter. He now has a
        graphic of a record chart next to him.

                   And the devastating impact of the
                   Canadian phenomenon is Terrance and
                   Phillip's new hit song, "Shut Your
                   Fucking Face, Unclefucka" which has
                   climbed the charts with a bullet --

        We see a clip from the video, "Unclefucka."

        The video has Terrance and Phillip dressed like Mase and
        Puffy in that video they did in Vegas.  They wear shiny
        bright jumpsuits and lunge at the fish-eye lens of the
        camera.

                             TERRANCE & PHILLIP
                        (Singing)
                   Shut your fucking face!
                   Unclefucka!!

        INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

        The news anchor shakes his head in disgust.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Thanks, midget. Shocking report.  The
                   controversy surrounding the Terrance and
                   Phillip movie began in the small mountain
                   town of South Park, Colorado where the
                   local PTA banned the movie.  With us
                   tonight is the head of the South Park
                   PTA, Sheila Brofloski-

        A screen appears with Kyle's mother, looking very pissed. The
        TITLE below her reads 'Outraged Mother'.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Ms. Brovlofski, how are these kids seeing
                   this film? Is bad parenting to blame? Or
                   is it Canada?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Canada!

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Alright. Here with a counterpoint is the
                   Canadian Minister of Movies.

        A split screen appears, Kyle's mother on one side, and a
        goofy looking Canadian slides into the other.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Thank you, Minister, for joining us.

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Thanks for having me, buddy.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   Minister, parents all over America are
                   concerned about your country's
                   entertainment. Your thoughts?

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Well, the film is R rated, and it's not
                   intended for children-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh but OF COURSE children are going to
                   see it!!

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Uh, can I finish? Can I finish? ...The
                   fact is that we Canadians are quite
                   surprised by your outrage-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   YOU JUST DON'T CARE!

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Can I finish? Hello? Can I finish? ...The
                   United States has graphic images of
                   violence on television all the time, what
                   is that one show? COPS? And car crashes
                   caught on tape? We can't believe that a
                   movie with some foul language and fart
                   jokes would piss you off so much.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ...
                   ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                   But minister, it isn't like this film is
                   the first troublesome thing to come out
                   of Canada. Let us not forget Brian Adams
                   a few decades ago.

        The Minister thinks.

                             CANADIAN MINISTER OF MOVIES
                   What?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   The Canadians are just mad that we
                   mothers here in South Park have the
                   chutzpah to stand up to them!  Like it or
                   not, Mr. Canadian Minister, OUR children
                   are now safe from your Canadian smut!

        INT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The boys are in the front row, this time with Wendy, watching
        the Terrance and Phillip movie.

                             TERRANCE
                   Well, Terrance I hope you learned
                   something from this whole experience.

                             PHILLIP
                   I did, Terrance, I learned that you are a
                   boner biting dick fart fuck face!

        The boys laugh merrily. Wendy just looks bored.

                             TERRANCE
                   Say Phillip, want to see the Northern
                   Lights?

                             PHILLIP
                   You bet, Terrance!

        Terrance pulls out a match, lights it, then farts.

        The flame burns Terrance to a blackened mass.

                             PHILLIP
                   HA HA HA! You burned yourself to death by
                   lighting the fart! HA HA HA!!

                             TERRANCE
                        (Just a skull)
                   I sure did, Phillip!!

        The boys laugh hysterically.

                             STAN
                   Did you see that, Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Yup.

        EXT. THEATER - DAY

        The boys walk out happily.

                             KYLE
                   Man, that movie gets better every time I
                   see it!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah, but you know what? That whole part
                   about lighting farts is bullshit. You
                   can't do that.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmpmh rm.

                             CARTMAN
                   No way.

                             STAN
                   Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Stan... I think you and I need some time
                   apart.

                             STAN
                   WHAT?!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh shit.

                             WENDY
                   It's just... It's obvious that we don't
                   have a whole lot in common anymore. I
                   need somebody who's... a little deeper.

                             STAN
                   But Wendy, I can go-

        Wendy places her little gloved hand over Stan's mouth.

                             WENDY
                   No. Don't speak. You'll only make things
                   more annoying. Goodbye, Stan.

        And just like that, Wendy is gone. Stan looks almost ready to
        cry.

        Kyle walks up behind Stan.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, anybody who doesn't think Terrance
                   and Phillip is funny can fuck off
                   anyways.

                             STAN
                        (Insincere)
                   Yeah...

        The boys walk off.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!!

                             CARTMAN
                   No you can't Kenny!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rm rmph!!

                             CARTMAN
                   Okay Kenny, I'll bet you a HUNDRED
                   DOLLARS you can't light a fart on fire!

                             KENNY
                   Mph mm!

        Kenny pulls out a book of matches.

        He strikes a match and holds it under his ass.

        After a few seconds Kenny farts, and there is a little flame.

        Suddenly, the flames catch and Kenny starts burning alive.

                             KENNY
                   MMMPMMPH!!! MGMFEODFO!!!

        Kenny runs around, and finally falls to the ground, still
        burning.

                             STAN
                   OH MY GOD!! YOU KILLED KENNY!!

                             KYLE
                   YOU BASTARD!!

        Cartman looks shocked.

                             CARTMAN
                   Wow, I guess you CAN do that!

        INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

        DOCTORS and NURSES are pushing Kenny into the operating room
        ER style.

        Everything is quick and chaotic. Shouts fill the hallway.

                             NURSE
                   CBC chem kit STAT!!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   LOAD THAT I.V. WITH 70CCS OF SODIUM
                   PENTOTHAL!!

        INT. OPERATING ROOM

        It's mid-operation.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Siphon the fluid off his brain!! Vacuum!

        Another nurse hands him a sucker tube.  He immediately shoves
        into Kenny's skull.  It starts to slurp and burble.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Try to untangle his trachea and
                   esophagus!

                             NURSE
                   Right!

        While Doctor Gauche wrestles with Kenny's lungs and torso,
        the nurse reaches into Kenny's mouth and pulls both his
        windpipe and esophagus out of his mouth, turning them inside
        out in the process.

        Off to the side, Stan, Cartman and Kyle look on as the doctor
        and nurses tangle themselves in knots with Kenny's innards.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   No! THAT DOESN'T GO THERE!!

                             NURSE
                   Watch his liver!!!

        Kenny's liver POPS out of his torso and slides across the
        floor.

                             ASSISTANT
                   I'll get it!!!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   We have precious little time left people!
                   We're going to lose him soon!!

        Suddenly, there is a long, BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP.

                             NURSE
                   Doctor, his heart's stopped!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Crack him.  Let's get it out of there!!!

        Doctor Gauche lifts Kenny's heart out of his body.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   We need to zap this, quick!

        And runs it to the microwave.  He opens the door.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Who's making a potato?

                             DOCTOR 2
                   My bad, sir.  I missed lunch.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Damn it! I am NOT going to lose this
                   kid!!!!!!

        INT. RECOVERY ROOM - LATER

        Fade up from black.  We're close on Kenny's face.  His little
        eyes start to open.

        Doctor Gauche leans over him Kenny.  Stan and Kyle are
        there.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Kenny.  Kenny, can you hear me?

        Kenny stirs.

                             KENNY
                        (Weakly)
                   Mph rmph rm...

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   How are you feeling, son?

                             KENNY
                   mph.... rmph....

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Great... Son, I have some bad news.  We
                   accidentally replaced your heart with a
                   baked potato.  You have about seven
                   seconds to live.

                             KENNY
                   Mrm?!

        Just then, Kenny's baked potato heart explodes, splattering
        gore all over the inside of the recovery room and on the
        outside of Dr. Gauche, Stan and Kyle.

                             STAN
                   Oh my God! THEY killed Kenny!

                             KYLE
                   You bastards!!

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Damn it!  It never gets any easier!
                   Anybody get the score of that Broncos
                   game?

        INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM

        Kyle's mother is waiting with the rest of the parents.

        The nurse walks up to Kenny's parents with a sad expression.

                             NURSE
                   I'm sorry...

        Kenny's mother breaks down.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Oh my God, they killed Kenny!

                             KENNY'S DAD
                   You bastards!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I knew this would happen! Those bastard
                   Canadians have now killed a child! Can't
                   people see the damage that film is
                   doing?!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   He was killed doing something he saw in
                   the movie. It was Terrance and Phillip...
                   THEY killed Kenny.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   You bastards.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This is it! The time for action is NOW!!
                        (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   This is like a spreading rash!
                   They're pulling out our children's
                   brains
                   and filling them with trash!
                   Can't you see what this is leading
                   to?
                   A world of smut and sex and poo!
                   I believe the good fight has begun!
                   Something must be done!

        Everyone gathers around Kyle's mother.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   I agree!
                        (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   We must take action fast!
                   My child used to say 'please and
                   thank you'
                   Now he says suck my ass!

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   And my boy was the sweetest boy the
                   world had ever known!
                   until those damn Canadians brought
                   that filth into our home!
                   I agree that there is now a battle
                   to be won!
                   We can't just stand here singing!
                   Something must be done!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   But what are we going to do against the
                   media machine? It's so big and powerful!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Right! And we can use that same media
                   machine to exploit OUR cause!  We've got
                   to let the whole world know what the
                   Canadians did to your son!

                             PARENTS
                   Yeah!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   COME ON!

        The parents all head out the door-

        EXT. HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS

        The doors to the hospital swing open, and the parents march
        out into the street, singing in unison as they go.

                             PARENTS
                        (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   Something's gotta give!
                   This world has become a bitch in
                   which
                   we have no desire to live!

        Cars come screeching to a halt as the parents sing in the
        middle of the road. People start honking their horns in
        frustration.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   My boy could have become a doctor
                   Or a lawyer rich and true
                   Instead he burned up like a piggy
                   on a bar-b-que!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We will fight for children's rights
                   in memory of your son!

                             PARENTS
                   We can't just stand here singing!
                   Something must be done!

        Cars are now smashing into each other, and flying off the
        road to people's deaths, as the music number has taken over
        the busy intersection.

                             PARENTS
                   We've pushed and pushed it to the
                   edge
                   And now the time has come!
                   Something's gotta change!
                   It's time to buy a gun!
                   We can't just stand here singing
                   No we can't just stand here singing
                   No we can't just stand here
                   singing!
                   Something must be done!!!

        A few more cars careen off and explode into flames as if
        ending the song with a borage of fireworks.

        INT. OPERATING ROOM -

        The boys gather around Kenny's lifeless body.

                             CARTMAN
                        (Dazed)
                   I bet him he couldn't do it... I bet him
                   a hundred dollars!

                             KYLE
                   Come on, Cartman. It's not your fault.

                             CARTMAN
                   No, I know. I'm just fucking STOKED I
                   don't have to pay him!

                             KYLE
                   Oh.

        The boys walk out, leaving Kenny's corpse behind. We can
        still hear the boys voices as they exit.

                             KYLE (O.S.)
                   I can't believe he's dead.

                             CARTMAN (O.S.)
                   Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now.
                   Like this has all happened before...

        After they leave, PUSH IN to Kenny's dead body, which is
        left all alone on the operating table.

        The camera continues to zoom in to Kenny's face...

        ZOOM IN on Kenny's dead face. We pass into his thoughs...

        FLASH!!

        EXT. SPACE -

        Kenny's body is floating through a great void. A PEACEFUL
        SONG plays as he soars upwards to the heavens.

        *note - except for Kenny's little construction paper body,
        this entire sequence should be done in 3D CGI.

        Ahead of him, Kenny can see a great white light. It appears
        warm and inviting.

        Now Kenny notices large beautiful breasts bobbing up and down
        in the heavens. He reaches out to touch them.

        Kenny blissfully floats upward toward the bright light and
        bobbing breasts. The music crescendos as Kenny gets almost
        close enough to the light to touch it.

        Just then, a huge, electronic sign pops up. 'Access Denied'.

        Suddenly, Kenny goes spiraling downward. The song changes to
        a MINISTRY type number as Kenny's surroundings start to
        become darker and more twisted.

        Kenny's hapless spirit enters a horrifying red tunnel, filled
        with flames and heat.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

        Burning souls SCREAM and CRY all around Kenny, as his body
        plunges into what is now obviously the depths of hell.

        Kenny passes images of Hitler, John Wayne Gacy, hunger and
        disease as he continues through the twisting tunnel.

        He then passes images of Jimmy Stewart and Gandhi. All of
        whom are opportunely locked in hell for all eternity.

        EXT. MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

        The same ticket guy from before is at the ticket booth. The
        marquee still reads 'Terrance and Phillip' but a huge sticker
        has been placed over it that reads 'banned'.

        The boys stand underneath the marquee looking baffled.

                             STAN
                   How can they do this?

                             KYLE
                   It isn't fair!

                             CARTMAN
                   Well, Terrance and Phillip are on Conan
                   O'Brian tonight, we could at least go
                   watch that.

        The boys hang their heads and walks away.

        The ticket guy suddenly hears a bunch of commotion. He sees a
        mob of angry mothers, led by Kyle's mother.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   THIS must be him, officer! This is the
                   scum that sold R rated tickets to
                   children!

                             TICKET GUY
                   What?! Jesus Christ, I didn't mean to!

        Barbrady slaps handcuffs on the freaked out teen.

                             OFFICER BARBRADY
                   You can explain downtown!

                             TICKET GUY
                        (Getting dragged away)
                   Oh shit! Hey it's not MY fault! You
                   should arrest those pervert Canadians!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh we will, Mr. Scumbag... We will...

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The boys are sitting on Cartman's couch watching TV.

        ANGLE - TELEVISION - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

        Conan comes back from a commercial break. Sitting next to
        him, is Ms. Brooke Shields.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   Our next guests have the number one movie
                   in the world right now, please welcome
                   Terrance and Phillip!

        A few cheers as Terrance and Phillip walk out on stage. A few
        boos as well, and we see that the South Park mothers are in
        the audience holding 'Anti-Terrance and Phillip' signs.

        Terrance and Phillip walk out and sit next to Brooke Shields.

                             PHILLIP
                   Hello, Conan!

                             TERRANCE
                   Hello, Brooke Shields!

                             CONAN
                   It's nice to have you here in America.

                             PHILLIP
                   Yeah, well, you being a Canadian and all,
                   we thought what the hell!

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   So guys... I understand you have a comedy
                   routine worked out for us.

                             PHILLIP
                   We sure do, Conan. And here it is. Excuse
                   me, Terrance.

                             TERRANCE
                   Yes, Phillip?

        Phillip rips a fart that launches Terrance backwards and into
        the band.  They both laugh wildly.

                             PHILLIP
                   Gotcha!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh. Nobody in the audience laughs.

        ANGLE - BOYS

        They laugh merrily.

        RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

                             TERRANCE
                   Good one, Phillip!  Cheers.

                             PHILLIP
                   Cheers, Terrance!

        Terrance extricates himself from the band. Conan is growing
        nervous. He looks out into the audience...

        Kyle's mother is sitting there, looking angry. Conan makes
        eye contact with her, and then nods his head. Kyle's mother
        nods back.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                        (Nervous)
                   So, guys, I need to ask you a serious
                   question...

                             PHILLIP
                   I just farted Terrance back into the
                   stone age!

        They both laugh hard.

        Brooke Shields waits a beat, then belts out a fake laugh.

                             BROOKE SHIELDS
                   I farted once on the set of Blue Lagoon!

                             TERRANCE
                   Nobody cares, Brooke Shields!

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   Terrance and Phillip... Whose idea was
                   it, to have a person lighting a fart on
                   fire in your movie? Who is responsible
                   for that?

        Terrance and Phillip exhange glances.

                             TERRANCE
                   Phillip, I think our friend Conan has
                   been working too hard.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   Say it! It was YOUR idea to have someone
                   light a fart on fire in your movie!

                             PHILLIP/TERRANCE
                        (Together)
                   It was our idea to have someone light a
                   fart on fire in your movie.

        ANGLE ON THE AUDIENCE

        Kyle's mother is among them, listening to all this.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                        (Into her lapel)
                   That's it!  Move, move, move!

        ANGLE ON TERRANCE AND PHILLIP

        A battalion of Army guys appear, seize Terrance and Phillip
        and arrest everyone in their group.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Terrance and Phillip, you are under
                   arrest for working in America without the
                   proper documents! WE GOT YOU!

        RESUME - THE CONAN O'BRIAN SHOW

                             TERRANCE
                   Phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed
                   by The Conan O'Brian Show!!

                             PHILLIP
                   This little scrotum sucker willfully
                   deceived us!
                        (Pointing to Conan)
                   You are a bad man!

                             TERRANCE
                   And you call yourself a Canadian!
                        (To Phillip)
                   I told you we should of done Leno!

        Conan O'Brian turns away, ashamed.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Don't listen to them, Mr. O'Brian.
                   They're master manipulators. You did a
                   good job.

                             TERRANCE
                   You loved our movie, Conan!  We watched
                   it together.  You... You laughed!

        Conan grabs his head.

                             CONAN O'BRIAN
                   What have I done?!!!

        Conan grabs a gun and blows his head off, dousing Brooke
        Shields with blood.

                             BROOKE SHIELDS
                   AGAHGAHGGH!!!! Mondays at eight
                   AAAGHGH!!!!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily. Kyle's mother cradles
        Conan's lifeless body.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   You see what your filth has caused?

                             TERRANCE

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        The boys are sitting on the couch in absolute shock.

                   Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and

                             KYLE

                   This could mean... No more Terrance and
                   Phillip - EVER!

        EXT. UNITED NATIONS - DAY

        Establishing shot.

        INT. UNITED NATIONS - GENERAL ASSEMBLY ROOM

        Lots of foreigners with their silly foreign outfits sit at
        their stupid microphones with their ridiculous translation
        headsets -- in the general assembly hall.  The Canadian
        Ambassador stands before them.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   As The Canadian Ambassador, I hereby
                   condemn the actions taken by America in
                   apprehending Terrance and Phillip!

        A MURMUR goes through the crowd.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   We demand their release IMMEDIATELY!! As
                   you can see from this graph, the entire
                   economy of Canada relies on Terrance and
                   Phillip! Without them we are doomed to
                   recession!

        The United Nations head bangs his gavel.

        Now Kyle's mother stands up. She is with a group of mothers
        all wearing M.A.C T-shirts.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   If I may?

        Everyone looks at Kyle's mother.

                   As president and founder of M.A.C., I

                   I would like to state that Canada must
                   learn to stop infiltrating our country
                   with its graphic art!

        Cheers from the Americans.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   Last time I checked America was a free
                   country!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Look at this!

        Kyle's mother pulls Kenny's mother up by the head.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This woman's child was KILLED by your
                   country's humor! Look how upset she is!

        Kenny's mom looks fine.

                             CANADIAN AMBASSADOR
                   We will continue to sell Terrance and
                   Phillip videos to anyone retarded enough
                   to buy it!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Then you leave me no choice... I call for
                   an EMBARGO on ALL Canadian Imports!!!

        More cheers from the Americans. The Canadians look worried.

        INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

        The boys are in the check out line at Bob's supermarket.

                             CARTMAN
                   What the hell do you mean I can't get
                   Cheesy Poofs?!

                             BOB
                   Sorry, kid. Cheesy Poofs are a Canadian
                   export. We can't carry them any more.

                             KYLE
                   Who the hell made up that law?!

                             CARTMAN
                   You can't do this!! Have you ever HAD
                   Cheesy Poofs? They're a taste sensation
                   with a delightful cheddar crunch.

                             BOB
                   There's nothing I can do. I can still
                   sell you Cheese-o's.

                             CARTMAN
                   FUCK Cheese-os and FUCK you!

        Cartman storms out. The boys follow him.

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - DAY

        The boys walk into Cartman's house. Cartman slams the door
        behind him. The boys all walk toward the living room.

                             CARTMAN
                   Come on, you guys... We have to THINK!

                             STAN
                   About what?

                             CARTMAN
                   About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This
                   whole thing has gone too far!

                             KYLE
                   I don't really think you need Cheesy-
                   Poofs, tubby-

        But the boys come to an abrupt halt when they reach the
        living room and see that all four mothers are waiting for
        them, silently.

        Everyone just sits there for a second. The lighting on Kyle's
        mother's face looks almost evil.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Boys, we have to have a difficult
                   discussion.

                             KYLE
                   We already know what you did. We saw it
                   on television.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, how come you arrested Terrance and
                   Phillip?

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Stanly, you're too young to understand
                   what's good for you. That's why we
                   mothers have taken charge.

                             KYLE
                   But they fucking didn't do anything
                   wrong!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah!  And what rim job expert went and
                   outlawed Cheesy Poofs!?

        The mothers all gasp in horror.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What was that word, young man!?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh, he said rim job.  It's when someone
                   licks your ass for-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I know what it is!

                             CARTMAN
                        (To his mother)
                   Lick someone's ass?!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   The Terrance and Phillip movie has
                   obviously done irreparable damage to
                   their brains.  We have to put them in
                   rehab right away.

                             KYLE
                   What's that?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   You boys need help.  There are rehab
                   centers that specialize in treating
                   people with chronic addictions to bad
                   language.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   There are?

        Kyle's mother thinks for a second.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Well no, I guess not...  But we will
                   establish the first of its kind right
                   here in South Park.  All the children in
                   town will have to attend and receive
                   treatment from the school counselor Mr.
                   Mackey!  Ooh I just love when I get these
                   sorts of ideas!

                             CARTMAN
                   Why?  So you can fuck up our life some
                   more?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Eric!  Don't talk to Ms. Brovlofski that
                   way!

                             CARTMAN
                   But mom!  I'm not fucking addicted to
                   fucking bad language!  I don't have a
                   fucking problem!

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Kenny walks through the black void of hell. A trippy, single
        shaft of light seems to follow him wherever he goes.

                             KENNY
                   Mphrmo?

        No answer... No nothing...

        Kenny continues on, flames shoot up randomly from the ground
        scaring the shit out of him.

                             KENNY
                   MPHR!! MMLY MMT!

        Suddenly, Kenny hears a CLAWING NOISE. It gets louder and
        louder. Kenny starts to run faster and faster. Now the
        clawing is RIGHT BEHIND HIM! Kenny spins around. He is face
        to face with SATAN!

        Satan looks down at Kenny and shoots flames out his nose.

        Kenny's eyes bulge open.

                             KENNY
                   MMMMMPHPHPHPHP!!!!!

                             SATAN
                   Fallen one... We have such sights to show
                   you!

        Kenny shakes. Satan turns to a whispy form and flashes across
        the room like a serpent, in a millisecond he is right up in
        Kenny's face.

                             SATAN
                   I am Satan. I am your God, now.

                             KENNY
                   MPH RM!!!

        Kenny tries to run away, but Satan again changes form, flies
        across the room and cuts Kenny off.

                             SATAN
                   Come with me. I will show you what
                   delightful pain awaits.

        Two black DEMONS grab Kenny by the arms and start to lead him
        away.

                             KENNY
                   MMMMMPHPHP!!!!

        Just then, SADDAM HUSSEIN show up next to Satan.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, a new recruit, huh? Welcome to hell,
                   kid! Relax! Take a load off!!

                             SATAN
                   You remember... Saddam Hussein, don't
                   you?!

        Kenny's eyes grow wide.

                             KENNY
                   MMMPPH!!!

        EXT. REHAB CENTER - DAY

        Establishing shot of the small Betty Fordesque building.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids are sitting in chairs in a circle.  There are anti-
        drug signs on the walls: "Crack is Whack"; "Get High on
        Pottery"; and, "I Go From Zero to Bitch in .9 Seconds."  MR.
        MACKEY, the wiry school counselor, leads the group.  There's
        a pottery wheel and lots of craft tables behind them.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay, it's come to my attention, that you
                   boys have a potty-mouth problem, mkay.
                   Now the sooner you recognize your
                   problem, mkay, the sooner we can get you
                   back to your third grade homeroom where
                   you belong.

                             KYLE
                   But they're just words, Mr. Mackey. Our
                   parents are over-reacting.

                             BEBE
                   Yeah, Wendy's here, and she doesn't even
                   like Terrance and Phillip!

        Wendy looks bored. Stan tries to smile at her, but she
        doesn't even acknowledge him.

        Meanwhile, Cartman is violently shaking in his seat.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having
                   Cheesy Poof withdrawal...

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay, kids from all over the State have
                   been brought here, because you all share
                   the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's
                   start with you.

        He points at Gregory. The little British bastard from the
        lake.

                             GREGORY
                   My name is Gregory... And I have a potty
                   mouth.

        Wendy looks at Gregory. Stan notices this.

                             CARTMAN
                   You've got a stupid accent too.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Eric, that is not appropriate.

                             CARTMAN
                   What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the
                   ear.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly
                   what I'm talking about. We have to change
                   the way you think.

                             GREGORY
                   How are you gonna do that?

        Mr. Mackey crosses to a piano. He plays chords while speaking
        the following lines.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   There are times when you get suckered in,
                   by drugs and alcohol and sex with wom-en.
                   But it's when you do these things too
                   much
                        (Singing)
                   That you've got to clear your head
                   and get back in touch...

        Mr. Mackey plays the piano and sings:

                             MR. MACKEY
                   You can do it, it's all up to you,
                   mkay?
                   With a method, there's nothing you
                   can't do, mkay?
                   You don't have to spend your life
                   addicted to crack
                   Homeless on the streets giving hand-
                   jobs for cash
                   as long as you follow this simple
                   plan
                   I'm fully convinced that it's,
                   easy, mkay...

        The kids are extremely disinterested. Mackey walks over to a
        chalkboard.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Step one: Think about fun. Think
                   about all that you'll miss addicted
                   to this
                   Step two: Think it all through.
                   Think how's this gonna change my
                   life, what am I gonna miss?
                   Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
                   anything that gets in your way!
                   And step four: Just don't do it
                   anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

        Mackey gets the children in a circle all holding hands.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Come on, kids! Sing along!

                             KIDS
                        (Extremely half-assed)
                   You can do it, it's all up to you
                   mkay?
                   With a method, there's nothing you
                   can't do, mkay?
                   We don't have to spend our lives
                   addicted to crack
                   Homeless on the streets giving hand-
                   jobs for cash

                             MR. MACKEY
                   As long as you follow my simple
                   plan
                   I'm fully convinced that it's,
                   easy, mkay...

        Everyone starts dancing in a circle.

                             KIDS
                   Step one: Think about fun. Think
                   about all that you'll miss addicted
                   to this Step two: Think it all
                   through. Think how's this gonna
                   change my life, what am I gonna
                   miss?
                   Step three: Go and hug a tree, Hug
                   anything that gets in your way!
                   And step four: Just don't do it
                   anymore - it's easy, Mkay!

                             MR. MACKEY
                   It's easy, Mkay?!

        Everyone falls down laughing.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - LOUNGE

        Kyle's mom and the other moms watch the kids and Mr. Mackey
        rolling around on the floor laughing on a security monitor.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What the hell do they think this is?!
                   Summer camp?!

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        Just then, Kyle's mother walks in with a scowling look,
        interupting the kids and Mr. Mackey who are still laughing
        merrily. The other mothers are behind her.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Mr. Mackey, what is going on?!

        Mr. Mackey stands up, looking scared.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Uh, we're just, starting our program...

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This is NOT a place for fun and games!
                   This is rehabilitation! Now GET TO IT!!
                   We at MAC have a trial to go to!

        The mothers walk away.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay.

        EXT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

        A news reporter stands in front of the Supreme Court. All
        around him are protestors, with signs that say CANADA NO! and
        CAN'TADA! Still others hold signs with Kenny on them.

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Tom I'm standing in front of the U.S.
                   Supreme Court where the most important
                   trial of the - day - is happening.
                   Thousands of people have shown up from
                   all over the country to show their
                   outrage and disgust at Canada. Joining me
                   now is Mrs. McKormick, mother of the poor
                   little boy who was killed by the
                   Canadians.

        Kenny's mother steps into frame. She is wearing a shirt with
        Kenny's picture on it. Written on the T-shirt is 'Have you
        seen my son? No, you haven't. He's dead.'

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Mrs. McKormick, you must really hate the
                   Canadians.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Yes, yes I do, Tom.

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Did you ever think you would see the day
                   when thousands of people were wearing
                   your son Kenny on T-shirts?

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   No I didn't. But if any of you would like
                   one they're 14.95. Available in blue or
                   white.

        The reporter thinks for a second, and then turns back to the
        camera.

                             NEWS REPORTER
                   Well, we can only imagine the intense,
                   vehement trial that is going on inside.

        INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

        Terrance and Phillip are on the stand.

                             JOHNNY COCHRAN
                   Terrance and Phillip... You knowingly,
                   with malice of forethought were trying to
                   destroy American culture, yes or no?

        Terrance rips a fart.

                             JOHNNY COCHRAN
                   YES OR NO!

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids are all in the main room, sitting on a couch,
        huddled around a television.

        They laugh merrily.

                             STAN
                   Shh! Mr. Mackey's gonna hear us!

        INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

                             TERRANCE
                   The Americans are just showing their TRUE
                   COLORS as smelly bastards.

                             PHILLIP
                   Fight the power!

                             TERRANCE
                   The young boy that died lit himself on
                   fire. It was unfortunate, but how can
                   they blame US?

                             PHILLIP
                   Don't believe the hype!!

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids all shout agreement.

                             KIDS
                        (Adlib)
                   Yeah! WooHoo!

        BACK TO COURTHOUSE

        Terrance and Phillip laugh merrily.

                             TERRANCE
                   You cannot oppress us! We will continue
                   to pursue our art. We know there are
                   Americans out there who will help us!

        Kyle's mother now stands up from the prosecutor's table.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Your 'ART' is shallow and immature! We
                   Americans do NOT allow that for our
                   children!!

                             PHILLIP
                   Please. You teach your children that
                   America is the land of the free. But it's
                   all bullshit. You're one of the most
                   conservative countries in the world!

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The children all listen, wide-eyed.

        INT. SUPREME COURT - DAY

                             TERRANCE
                   The problem is you don't allow your
                   children to think for themselves. You try
                   to raise them in a protective bubble, and
                   then when they finally get old enough,
                   they realize they've been lied to, and
                   they resent you for it.

                             PHILLIP
                   Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so
                   fucked up.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   THAT IS ENOUGH!!

                             TERRANCE
                   WAKE UP AMERICA! YOUR government censors
                   YOU from the world.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   NO THEY DON'T!

                             PHILLIP
                   YES THEY DO! AND I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU! IN
                   MARCH OF LAST YEAR, THE AMERICAN
                   GOVERNMENT-

        BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP.

        Suddenly, the screen goes blank. A sign that says 'PLEASE
        STAND BY' comes on.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

        The kids all watch, wide-eyed.

                             KYLE
                   What happened?

                             WENDY
                   The station CONVENIENTLY went blank.

        INT. CANADIAN PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

        The Canadian Prime Minister stands directly in front of
        camera, looking right at us.

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   ATTENTION AMERICA!! You have taken our
                   national treasure Terrance and Phillip.
                   We, in turn, have taken yours... The
                   Smothers Brothers!

        The Canadian Prime Minister steps out of the way, revealing
        the Smothers Brothers tied up in chairs behind him.

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   I'll let you catch your breath... Now,
                   release Terrance and Phillip, or else we
                   will EXECUTE your beloved Smothers
                   Brothers!!

                             TOMMY SMOTHERS
                   Please listen to them!!

                             DICK SMOTHERS
                   They're not fucking around!!

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   We're not fucking around. This is not
                   aboot deals. This aboot dignity. This is
                   aboot freedom... This is aboot respect.
                   RETURN Terrance and Phillip NOW!!!

        Another Canadian leans in and whispers in the Prime
        Minister's ear.

                             CANADIAN PRIME MINISTER
                   Oh yeah... AND FUCK YOU, AMERICA!

        He raises his middle finger, but it's all blurred and
        digitized.

        INT. REHAB CENTER - SOUTH PARK'S BETTY FORD CENTER

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Okay kids, for today's rehabilitation
                   activity, we're going to watch the
                   Terrance and Phillip movie.

                             STAN
                   What?!

                             KYLE
                   Sweet!

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Now, this is an EDITED version of the
                   movie, which was put out by the MPAA.
                   That's the Motion Picture Association of
                   America.

                             WENDY
                   Isn't that censorship?

                             MR. MACKEY
                   No the MPAA is NOT a censorship group.

                             WENDY
                   Why not?

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Uh... Because they say so... Mkay. Now I
                   want you to watch this movie, with all
                   the immature profanity taken out, and
                   notice how much better a movie it
                   becomes...

        Mackey puts the tape in and hits play.

        The TITLES come up 'Terrance and Phillip Asses of Fire'
        Except that 'Asses' has been blurred out, and replaced with
        'bunz'.

                             KIDS
                   HOORAY!!!

        The movie begins. Phillip walks in. But it isn't Phillip's
        voice, somebody has dubbed him over.

                             DUBBED PHILLIP
                   Hey Terrance. I feel like I'm going to
                   pass gas near your head.

                             DUBBED TERRANCE
                   I would rather you didn't, Phillip.

                             DUBBED PHILLIP
                   Oh? Is that so?

        Phillip farts on Terrance.

                             TERRANCE
                   Oh, you are such a maroon!

                             PHILLIP
                   You would know, dummy.

        The boys look confused.

                             TERRANCE
                   You are pigeon-like in your intelligence.

        The pseudo-Terrance and Phillip laugh. Terrance throws a
        match on Phillip and Phillip burns to death.

        A TITLE comes up - THE END.

        And the credits roll.

                             CARTMAN
                   WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?!

                             KYLE
                   Dude, they cut out 92 minutes!

        The lights in the theater come up.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   So you see, the point and the theme of
                   the film is kept intact. And of course,
                   the MPAA didn't cut out any of the
                   graphic violence. What did you think?

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to
                   get the taste of ass out of my mouth from
                   that piece of shit movie.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Eric, you're not watching your mouth!

                             CARTMAN
                   You get me Cheesy Poofs with the
                   delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch
                   my fucking mouth!

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   I am not a prickfuck, mkay? You little
                   asshole!

        Mackey slaps his hand over his mouth and looks around, scared.

                             CARTMAN
                   Ha, ha, you stupid asshole prickfuck.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Very encouraging. Most of the children
                   have been weened from their naughty
                   mouths.

                   Well, some of the children just don't
                   respond to 12 step programs.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Then we'll have to resort to plan B and
                   call the v-chip organization.

        Dramatic MUSIC STING. Mackey looks afraid.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been
                   fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.

                   Madam foreman, have you reached a

                   few years.

        The judge bangs her gavel.

                             JUDGE
                   Terrance and Phillip, for crimes against
                   the great nation of America you are
                   hereby sentenced to DEATH.

        HUGE MUSIC STING.

                             TERRANCE
                   DEATH?! You gotta be shittin' me!

                             PHILLIP
                   Aghgh!

        Phillip passes out.

        The kids can't believe what they're seeing. Everyone is
        silent. Finally, Kyle perks up.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!

                             STAN
                   How do we do that?

        Kyle thinks for a moment.

                             WENDY
                   You raise awareness by distributing
                   buttons, stickers and leaflets.

                             CARTMAN
                   That'd be sweet! We could try to bring
                   back Cheesy Poofs!

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, let's make Free Terrance and
                   Phillip buttons!

                             WENDY
                   You guys don't even care. All you care
                   about is seeing Terrance and Phillip fart
                   on each other more.

        The boys sit there and blink.

                             STAN
                   Yeah!

                   This is about freedom of speech, Stan,
                   about censorship.

        The handsome English kid, Gregory chimes in.

                             GREGORY
                   Yes, what's next? Barcodes on our
                   forearms? This country is the most
                   fascist of all.

        Wendy looks at Gregory deeply. Gregory smiles at her.

                             STAN
                   What the hell are you talking about, kid?

                             WENDY
                   You don't get it Stan... You just don't
                   get it.

        Wendy walks away.

                   That British dickhole is what's taking

                   I thought she wasn't your girlfriend,

                   She's Not! But if she WAS it would be
                   THAT little asshole who's fucking it up

                   need to work more on not saying the F

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Kenny is chained up in a torture chamber in Hell.  Demons and
        ghouls surround him.

                             SATAN
                   Prepare thyself for unending pain!
                   Unparalleled misery!!

        Kenny starts to cry.

        Saddam Hussein comes out from behind Satan holding a martini.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked
                   up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer
                   again.

                             KENNY
                   Mrph mprph!!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   What? What do you mean you don't belong
                   here? Relax guy, hell is for children.

                             KENNY
                   Mrph mprhm mm rmph!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   A deal? You wanna make a deal with the
                   devil. Well sure, deals are mounds o'
                   fun.

                             SATAN
                        (To Saddam)
                   Saddam, would you let me do my job
                   please!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey relax, guy. Let's see what the kid
                   wants.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, you want out of hell, huh?

                             SATAN
                   Well of COURSE he wants out of hell! The
                   whole POINT of hell is that you don't
                   WANT to be here!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Okay, kid, I have a deal for you! If you
                   want out of hell, all you have to do is
                   collect 10 proofs of purchases from
                   'Snacky Smores.'  They're rich,
                   chocolatey and really hit the spot. Bring
                   me ten proofs of purchases and we'll
                   grant you ANY WISH YOU WANT.

                             KENNY
                   Mrph?

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I wouldn't bullshit you kid! Snacky
                   Smores are now available in stores
                   everywhere! No biggie!

        Saddam walks over to Kenny and releases his chains.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                        (To Kenny)
                   Well what are you waiting for pal?!  Get
                   to it!

        Kenny runs out and away.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   HA HA HAHA!! What a dumbass!!

        Saddam walks over and joins Satan on the couch.

                             SATAN
                   I don't see why you have to belittle me
                   in front of people like that.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, relax guy. It's just a cruel joke.
                   Rich, chocolatey Snacky Smores are only
                   available up on Earth. He'll never get
                   'em, see?

                             SATAN
                   Sometimes I just think you don't have any
                   respect for me.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, come here, guy.

        Saddam pulls Satan around and plants a big wet kiss on him.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Who's my cream puff?

                             SATAN
                   I am.

        INT. PTA MEETING - DAY

        A large crowd of parents has gathered for a PTA meeting.

        Kenny's mother is at a table selling dead Kenny t-shirts. She
        has a shitload of money all around her. Another MOTHER walks
        up, hands Kenny's mom money, and gets a shirt.

                             MOTHER
                   Is that a new pearl bracelet, Mrs.
                   McKormick?

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   Why yes. Yes it is.

        Meanwhile, Kyle's mother is on the stand.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   As our next official order of business
                   here at M.A.C., we will test the new V-
                   chip. As most of you know, the V-chip was
                   created to lock children out of watching
                   certain shows on television. And now the
                   N.I.H. has created a new, exciting
                   product that they can tell us all about.
                   Here is the Surgeon General, Dr.
                   Pangloss.

        DOCTOR PANGLOSS, a lab technician in white takes the podium.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Thank you, parents.

        One person claps. Pangloss hits a button and a slide
        projector starts showing pictures of the device.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   The machinery of the new 'V-chip' is very
                   simple, and similar to that of the V-
                   chip. The chip is placed just under the
                   subject's skin, where it emits a small
                   but painful shock of electricity whenever
                   an obscenity is uttered.

        The parents are fascinated.

                             STAN'S FATHER
                   Now wait a minute, are you telling us
                   that this chip somehow KNOWS if the kid
                   is swearing?

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   It's just like a lie detector. Certain
                   things happen in you when you swear just
                   like when you lie, the chip picks up on
                   this and gives the subject a shock.

        The parents AD LIB 'Ooohs' and 'Ahhhhs'

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   We are very excited to see the results of
                   this test.
                        (Calling)
                   Patient 453, would you step out here,
                   please?

        Cartman steps out wearing a hospital gown.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Patient 453 here has been fitted with the
                   new v-chip...

                             CARTMAN
                   My head hurts.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Don't worry about that. Now, I want you
                   to say 'Doggy.'

                             CARTMAN
                   Doggy.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Notice that nothing happens.
                        (To Cartman)
                   Now say 'Montana.'

                             CARTMAN
                   Montana.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Good. Now 'Pillow'.

                             CARTMAN
                   Pillow.

                             DOCTOR PANGLOSS
                   Alright, now I want you to say
                   'horsefucker.'

        Cartman looks offstage to his mother.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Go ahead, it's alright, Eric.

        Cartman smiles.

                             CARTMAN
                   Horsefuck-

        BZZZZZAAAAT!!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AGAAHGAHGAH!!!!!

        Cartman falls to the floor in pain. All the parents ooh and

                   that our kids are NEVER AGAIN exposed to

        The crowd goes wild.

        EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

        School is now Naziesque. A military drum echoes in the
        distance.

        INT. CLASSROOM - SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY - DAY

        Stan and Kyle are sitting in their desks, waiting for school
        to begin.

        Wendy walks by on her way to her desk.

                             STAN
                   Hi Wendy.

                             WENDY
                        (Not even looking)
                   Hi Stan.

        Wendy walks on by.

                             KYLE
                   Wow, dude. Wendy could really give a rats
                   ass about you.

                             STAN
                        (Eyes still on Wendy)
                   I bet she would if my name was GREGORY!!

                             KYLE
                   Good thing she was never your
                   girlfriend... Dude, here comes Cartman.

        Cartman walks in and gingerly sits down.

                             KYLE
                   Hey, Cartman, did they put that V-chip in
                   your head or your ass?

                             STAN
                   What's the difference?

        Stan and Kyle laugh.

                             CARTMAN
                   Very funny dickhead-

        BZZAAT!  The v-chip shocks Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   OW!  FUCK-

        BZZZAAAT!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AY!

        Cartman is thrown to the floor in a shivering heap.

                             KYLE
                   Whoa!  What the hell was that?!

                             STAN
                   Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him
                   ever time he cusses!

        Stan and Kyle look at each other.  Kyle smiles.

                             KYLE
                   Hey Cartman.

                             CARTMAN
                   What?

                             KYLE
                   You know, me and Stan were just talking
                   about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck
                   you are.

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-

        BZAAAT!

                             CARTMAN
                   SHIT-

        BZZZAAAT!!

                             CARTMAN
                   FUCK-

        BZZAAAT!!  The cycle continues as Stan and Kyle laugh merrily
        watching Cartman flopping around on the floor.

                             KYLE
                   This is sweet!!

                             STAN
                   Totally!

        Garrison stands before his class.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Okay, children, let's try a few new math
                   problems. What is five times two?

        The kids all just sit there.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Come on, children, do be shy, just give
                   it your best shot.

        Clyde raises his hand.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Yes, Clyde?

                             CLYDE
                   Twelve?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Okay, now let's try to get an answer from
                   somebody who's not a complete retard.
                   Anyone? Come on don't be shy...

        Just then, the door bursts open and in walks a couple of Nazi
        looking American soldiers.

        They walk over to the children and start pulling off their
        'Free Terrance and Phillip' pins.

                             STAN
                   Hey, what are you doing?

                             SOLDIER
                   You can't wear these in school. It's
                   against school policy, thank you.

        Another solider rips off Kyle's pin and replaces it with a
        yellow star.

                             KYLE
                   What's that for?

                             SOLDIER 2
                   You get a star for doing well in school.

        Just as quickly, the soldiers make their way out the door.

                             WENDY
                   NAZIS!!

                             STAN
                   What's the matter, Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.

                             STAN
                        (To Kyle)
                   God damn it, why does she keep saying
                   that?

        INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

        The boys are in line. Nazi-ish soldiers usher them through.

                             STAN
                   I'm so sick of these soldiers.

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, they suck.

                             CARTMAN
                   I know.  Always saying, do this, do that.
                   They think they're so cooool.
                        (To the soldier)
                   Acht lieben kraft auct shpiler!
                        (BZZZT)
                   OW!!!

        The soldier glares at him. The boys walk into the kitchen,
        where they are greeted by their big, happy, black school
        CHEF!

                             CHEF
                   Hello there, children!!

                             STAN
                   Hey, Chef.

                             CHEF
                   How would like some Salisbury Steak with
                   buttered noodles?

                             KYLE
                   We can't, we're on a hunger strike.

                             CHEF
                   A hunger strike? For what?

                             STAN
                   To free Terrance and Phillip.

                             CARTMAN
                   But you guys... It's Salisbury steak.

                             STAN
                   Chef, do you know anything about women?

                             CHEF
                   Ha! Is the Pope Catholic?

                             KYLE
                   I don't know.

                             CHEF
                   Children, I know ALL there is to know
                   about women.

                             STAN
                   What's the secret to making a woman
                   happy?

                             CHEF
                        (Dishing out food)
                   Oh that's easy, you just gotta find the
                   clitoris.

                             STAN
                   Huh?

        Suddenly, Chef realizes who he's talking to.

                             CHEF
                   Oops, I guess you haven't got that far
                   in your anatomy class, huh?

                             STAN
                   No, what does that mean, find the
                   clitoris?

                             CARTMAN
                   Is that like finding Jesus or something?

        Now Chef starts to panic.

                             CHEF
                   Uh... Nothing. Forget I said anything.
                   Now move along, children! You're holding
                   up the line!

        Just then, the P.A. blares out an announcement.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA (O.S.)
                   ATTENTION ALL SOUTH PARK ELEMENTARY

                             STAN
                   Woa, I wonder what's going on, dude.

        INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

        All the elementary students are gathered in front of a large
        television monitor.

        Mr. Garrison and his class walk in and look confused.

        The boys walk up to Chef.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   Please take your seats, everyone!!!!

        They all go to their seats.

                             KYLE
                   What's going on, Chef?

                             CHEF
                   Something big, children.

        The television goes from that Emergency broadcast signal to a
        scene of a news anchor sitting at his desk.

                             NEWS ANCHOR
                       (Very serious)
                   This is a State of Emergency. We go now
                   to the White House for a VERY IMPORTANT
                   ANNOUNCEMENT from the President of the
                   United States.

        INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY

        The President is sitting in a chair by the fireplace.

                             PRESIDENT CLINTON
                   Ladies and gentlemen... At five a.m.
                   today, a day which will live in infamy...
                   sort of... the U.S. has declared war on
                   Canada.

        ANGLE - KIDS

        They all stare in silence. Mr. Garrison takes a deep breath.

                             CHEF
                   Oh, no...

                             MR. MACKEY
                   I don't believe it.

                             CARTMAN
                   Holy crap-
                       (BZZZT!)
                   OW!! Hey crap isn't a swear word, what
                   the fuck?!
                       (ZZZZZZTTT)
                   AGAGAGH!!!

                             PRESIDENT CLINTON
                   All Canadians are to leave the country
                   immediately, or be subject to military
                   camps. All Canadian products are to be
                   thrown out.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   How can they do this?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   I never thought there would be war again
                   in my lifetime...

        INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY

                             PRESIDENT CLINTON
                   Do not be afraid of this war. Instead
                   embrace it. We have God on our side. And
                   besides, they're just Canadians, what the
                   hell are they gonna do?

        INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

        Everyone watches the television in stunned silence.

                             STAN
                   Chef, what does it mean that we're at
                   war?

                             CHEF
                   It's... It's not good children.

                             PRINCIPAL VICTORIA
                   What do we do? Do we go on as normal
                   or...?

                             MR. GARRISON
                   I don't know Principal Victoria... I
                   don't know...

                             PRESIDENT
                   And now, I would like to bring up the
                   woman who led, and is still leading the
                   way in this glorious stand-

                             KYLE
                       (Pointing to TV)
                   HOLY SHIT DUDE!!

        Kyle's mom appears on the TV dressed in military garb.

                             PRESIDENT
                   Mrs. Sheila Brovlofski.

                             CHEF
                   Isn't that your mother, Kyle?

        Kyle can't believe it.

        On the television, Kyle's mother walks up to the podium. She
        is dressed to the hilt. She hugs the President and the first
        lady and then takes a deep breath.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   My fellow Americans. I have led this
                   fight in the War against profanity. I
                   have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our
                   neighbor to the north has abused us for
                   the last time.

                             PRESIDENT
                   As Commander in chief, I have ordered our
                   Army to set up defensive positions along
                   the US-Canada border in anticipation of
                   an attack.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What about air strikes?

                             PRESIDENT
                   Huh?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We have to have air strikes on their
                   military and entertainment centers.  It's
                   the only way to ensure that their smut
                   can't reach American soil!

                             PRESIDENT
                   Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes
                   are necessary.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I
                   remind you that our country's heart and
                   soul are at stake, and our children's
                   minds are the battlefield!
                   The bastard Canadians want to fight us
                   because we won't tolerate their potty
                   mouths. Well, if it is war they want...
                   THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!

        A huge eruption of cheers from the crowd in front of Kyle's
        mother. She is obviously floored by it. She can't help but
        smile. She actually holds her head up higher, and then raises
        her arms up in two peace signs, as the cheers get louder.

        The president forces a smile and actually applauds with the
        rest of the crowd.

        Back in the gymnasium, Kyle looks thoroughly embarrassed.

                             CHEF
                   Damn, your mom's a bitch, Kyle.

                             CARTMAN
                   Amen to that.

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Kenny is sadly walking around hell. He walks up to another
        one of hell's prisoners.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

                             GEORGE BURNS
                   Snacky Smores? Why the hell would I have
                   proofs of purchases from Snacky Smores?
                   Beat it, kid.

        Kenny moves along. He hears some voices coming from a door.
        Kenny opens the door and peeps inside-

        INT. SATAN'S BEDROOM - KENNY'S POV

        Saddam and Satan are lying in bed.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   You just get cranky when you're tired,
                   that's all.  I told you that you
                   shouldn't have tried to carry that futon
                   all by yourself.

                             SATAN
                   I'm not cranky.  And that futon was not
                   too big to carry myself-

        Just then, Satan hears a reporter on CNN.

                             TV
                   In war news, countries from Europe and
                   Asia are joining sides in the Canadian-
                   American War-

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   -Listen butterbuns, let's make love and
                   forget about the whole thing-

                             SATAN
                   SHHH!!!!

                             TV
                   ...The death count is already on its way
                   to 10 million with no signs of slowing
                   down.  What started as a spat between the
                   United States and Canada is quickly
                   turning into World War III-

        Kenny's eyes bulge, he wants to see more, but Satan clicks
        off the television and sits up in bed.

                             SATAN
                   It has come to be...  The Four Horsemen
                   are drawing nigh!  The time of the
                   prophecy is upon us!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh I love when you get all biblical
                   Satan.  You know exactly how to turn my
                   crank!

                             SATAN
                   No I'm being serious! Those Canadian
                   entertainers are to be killed. It is the
                   seventh sign.

        Satan walks over to large pedestal which holds an ancient
        tome.  Satan turns the pages as he talks.

                             SATAN
                   Behold, the signs of my reign on earth
                   are all falling into place!  The fall of
                   an empire-

        He points to an ancient-looking picture of the death of
        Ceasar.

                             SATAN
                   -The coming of a comet-

        He points to a picture of a comet passing by Earth.

                             SATAN
                   Jerry Springer's movie doing more than
                   ten million box office-

        A picture of Jerry Springer holding a bunch of money.

                             SATAN
                   ....And now....

        Satan points to an ancient drawing on the wall. It looks like
        Terrance and Phillip being stabbed in the head.

                             SATAN
                   The seventh sign!  When the blood of
                   these Canadians touches American soil...
                   It will be my time to rise!!!!!

        DRAMATIC music.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!

                             SATAN
                   Do you always think about sex?  I'm
                   talking about some very important stuff
                   here!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Listen buttercup, let's make love and
                   forget about the whole thing.

                             SATAN
                   Is sex the only thing that matters to
                   you?

        Saddam thinks for a second.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I love you.

        Satan sits with his arms crossed and a frown.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   You know I do.

                             SATAN
                   I know.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   So what do you say we shut off that light
                   and get close, huh?

        Satan reaches over and turns off the light.  Everything goes
        pitch black. The light goes off of Kenny's face as well.

        A beat.

        Then, a small moan from Satan.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Yeah, you like that, don't you bitch?

        EXT. SOUTH PARK AVENUE - DAY

        Stan and Kyle are walking down South Park Avenue. Stan is
        reading out of a huge book.

                             KYLE
                   Does it say what the clitoris is?

                             STAN
                   All it says is that it's above the
                   vulva... But where the hell is the vulva?

                             KYLE
                   Isn't that in Arizona or something?

        Stan and Kyle walk into the middle of town, where a HUGE
        bonfire of Terrance and Phillip videos, posters, and Canadian
        items like syrup and hockey sticks are burning away.

        The soldiers throw Stan's book on top of the pile, and it
        starts to burn.

        Stan and Kyle walk up to where Cartman is standing.

                             STAN
                   What is this?

                             CARTMAN
                   They're burning all the Canadian stuff
                   cause of the war.

                             STAN
                   That book wasn't Canadian!

        Clyde, one of the kids from school, throws his Terrance and
        Phillip dolls into the burning mass.

        Kyle stops him on his way back.

                             KYLE
                   Dude, don't you like Terrance and Phillip
                   anymore?

                             CLYDE
                   Of course not! We're at war! My daddy
                   says I HATE Canadians now!

        More kids line up to burn their Terrance and Phillip stuff.

        Several random mothers from M.A.C. are standing in front of
        the bonfire with anti-Canadian signs and T-shirts. The boys'
        parents aren't around, but another MAC mother is leading the
        charge.

                             MAC MOTHER
                   THAT'S IT! BURN EVERYTHING CANADIAN!!!
                   MAKE OUR COUNTRY DECENT AGAIN FOR OUR
                   CHILDREN!!!

        A townsperson throws Alanis Morisette albums into the fire.

        Another townsperson runs up and throws in a bag of Cheesy
        Poofs.
   
                          CARTMAN
                   NNOOOO!!!! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! OH, WHY
                   GOD, WHY?!
   
        Cartman falls to his knees and cries as the Cheesy Poofs burn
        away.

                             CARTMAN
                   This is all cause of your mom, Kyle.
                   She's such a bitch-
                       (BBBZAATT!!)
                   AGH!! I mean - she's such a... meanie.

                             KYLE
                   And she's getting worse...

                             STAN
                   Dude... Isn't that your brother?

        Kyle looks to where a group of big, mean FIFTH GRADERS have
        encircled Ike.

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   Why don't you go back to your own
                   country, CANADIAN!

                             FIFTH GRADER 2
                   Yeah, go eat some potatoes and ride
                   donkeys!

                             IKE
                   Eee todo ba!

        Kyle's eyes grow wide. He dashes over.

                             KYLE
                   Hey! Leave him alone!

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   It's just a smelly Canadian. They're like
                   rats.

                             KYLE
                   He's my brother!

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   You don't look Canadian.

                             KYLE
                   He's adopted!

        Kyle picks his brother up and tries to protect him.

                             FIFTH GRADER
                   Well you better get his beady eyed
                   Canadian ass out of America before my
                   daddy finds him!!

        The boys watch in horror as the fifth graders run over and
        throw more Canadian items into the fire.

                             KYLE
                   It's only a matter of time before my mom
                   has HIM burned too!

                             STAN
                   What has the world come to? This is
                   horrible. We're locked up, burning books,
                   hating other people-

                             CARTMAN
                   -no Cheesy Poofs.

                             STAN
                   -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is
                   happening?

        DRAMATIC MUSIC begins.

                             KYLE
                   I don't know. But it has gone far enough!
                   I'm sick of it!
                       (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   Change has got to come around!
                   They're taking all our laughter
                   and burning it to the ground!
                   Can't you see what this is leading
                   to?
                   A world of chains and ties and
                   glue!
                   We have to fight before they've
                   taken every one!
                   Something must be done!

                             STAN
                   I agree! The only way to save our future
                   is to unite and fight!
                       (Singing)
                   Something must be done!
                   We must take action fast!
                   My parents have gotten so strict
                   they forgot they were children in
                   the past!

                              CARTMAN
                   And my mom has become so bu-sy
                   that she's raising heck and
                   ignoring me
                   I agree that there is now a battle
                   to be won!
                   Something must be done!

                             STAN
                   But what are we going to do against this
                   entire army?

                             KYLE
                   We've gotta get the word out. We'll get
                   on my dad's computer and use the
                   internet! Come on you guys!

        The boys proudly head down the street.

                             BOYS
                   Something must be done!
                   Something's gotta give!
                   This world has become a bitch in
                   which
                   we have no desire to live!

        (*note- cartman gets shocked again on 'bitch')

                             BOYS
                   We've pushed it to the edge
                   And now the time has come!
                   Something's gotta change!
                   Something must be done!
                   Something must be done!!!

        INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - KYLE'S DAD'S OFFICE

        Kyle is at the keyboard of his dad's computer. Stan and
        Cartman are waiting in the background.

                             KYLE
                   Okay... I just need to find a few private
                   message boards...

                             STAN
                   Wait! Before we put a message out, do a
                   search on the word 'clitoris'.

                             KYLE
                   Okay...

        Kyle types in the word and hits return.

                             KYLE
                       (Reading the screen)
                   "Found Eight Million Pages With the Word
                   Clitoris"!

                             STAN
                   Wow!

                             KYLE
                   I'll just try the first one.

        Kyle clicks the mouse. They wait for the screen to load.
        Finally, it does.

                             KYLE
                   Dude! It's a lady giving a blow job to a
                   horse!

        Stan and Cartman rush over.

                   Is it Cartman's mom?

                             CARTMAN
                   Very funny!

                             KYLE
                   Hey... It IS Cartman's mom!!

        Cartman looks at the screen.

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh, son of a bitch!
                       (ZZAP!!)
                   AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!

                             STAN
                   Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!

        Ike bounces in, happily.

                   Ber dada!

                             KYLE
                   Get out of here Ike, you're too young for
                   this stuff!

                             IKE
                   Papa mama simi.

        Ike bounces out.

                             CARTMAN
                   Come on, just get to the message board!

                             KYLE
                   I'm trying, I can't find a Canadian
                   server... I've got to break into the main
                   frame...

        Kyle furiously hits a bunch of keys.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it! They've got an access code! I'll
                   try to reroute the encryptions...

        Kyle furiously hits a bunch more keys.

                             STAN
                   Dude, do you know what you're doing?

                             KYLE
                   No, dude, all you have to do is hit the
                   keys really fast and say a bunch of
                   stupid shit and it works.
   
        Just then the screen pops up. Access Granted.

                   Bingo. Okay, here we go...

                   Tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.

                             KYLE
                   We're not gonna have pie and punch!

                             CARTMAN
                   More people will come if they think

        INT. KYLE'S ATTIC

        The door to the attic pops open.  Kyle shoves Ike up into the
        attic.

                             KYLE
                   You stay up here in the attic, Ike.
                   Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?

                   Uhh...

                             KYLE
                   Goodnight, Ike, we're all going to bed.

        The door closes and it is dark.

        Ike blinks. He looks out a small window, onto the street
        below.

        A few armed soldiers walk by.

        Ike pulls out a little plastic harmonica and sadly starts to
        play.

        INT. PENTAGON - NIGHT

        Tons of MILITARY PERSONNEL are running to and fro. Giant
        computer screens show Canada's latest attacks.

                             SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                   Sir! The Canadians have destroyed Des
                   Moines!!

                             PRESIDENT
                   How can you tell?

        Everyone laughs merrily.

                             SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
                   Good one, sir!

        Suddenly, a PENTAGON GUY runs up to the President, holding
        some papers.

                             PENTAGON GUY
                   Sir, we're tracking a signal crossing
                   into Canadian computers! It looks like we
                   may have a resistance movement
                   starting...

        The President grabs the papers and dashes over to Kyle's
        mother, who is standing there looking smug, with her arms
        behind her back and her chest out. She has a few military
        badges on her.

                             PRESIDENT
                       (Showing her the papers)
                   Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance...
                   It's probably Canadian spies!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Well find out where that signal is coming
                   from!  Then hunt them down like dogs!
                   Any and all Canadian influence must be
                   stopped at all cost!

                             PRESIDENT
                   Yes ma'am!

        The President starts to run off.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And Bill?

                             PRESIDENT
                   Yes?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I'm needing lunch.

                             PRESIDENT
                   Right away, ma'am!

        The president runs off.

        EXT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        Establishing.

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   And so the draft will begin tomorrow, as
                   more and more troops are needed to fight
                   the Canadian forces...

        INT. CARTMAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT

        Cartman's mother is tucking him into bed.

                             RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                   What is quickly being referred to as 'The
                   Great Canadian-American War' has already
                   reached a death toll of two million.

        Cartman's mother reaches over and switches off the radio.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Goodnight, honey.

                             CARTMAN
                   Mom... When is the war gonna be over?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You
                   want it to end quickly, huh?

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh, I don't care, I was just asking cuz
                   all my favorite TV shows have been
                   replaced by news and it's pissing me off.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh.

        With that, Cartman's mother gets up-

                             CARTMAN
                   Mom...

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Yes, hon?

                             CARTMAN
                   If you went down on a horse... You'd tell
                   me, right?

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Sure, hon. Goodnight.

        She switches off the light, and leaves.

        Cartman lies there, lit only by soft, blue moonlight and
        thinks.

        He hears a SCRAPING noise, and looks a little scared, but
        then tries to close his eyes to sleep.

                             CARTMAN
                   Go away, scary noise.

        Again the SCRAPING. Cartman pops open hs eyes to see -

        KENNY! He is transparent and floating above Cartman's bed.

        Cartman is horrified. Too much so to even scream.

        Kenny puts his hands to his mouth to try and speak, but he
        makes no sound.

        Finally, Cartman lets out a piercing cry.

        Cartman's mother comes running in, just as the image of Kenny
        disappears.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Eric?! Eric, what is it?!

                             CARTMAN
                   I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!

        Cartman's mother looks around and sees nothing. Finally, she
        just cradles Cartman's fat head in her arms.

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh you poor dear. You've been through so
                   much...

                             CARTMAN
                   I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire
                   and now he's all pissed off!!
                       (BZZTZT!)
                   AGH! I can't say pissed off?!
                       (BAZZTZT!!)
                   AGH!!

        INT. HELL - DAY (MOVED)

        Kenny is again snooping around. He quietly creaks Satan's
        door open and walks in.

        Satan is in his room, looking at a map of Earth.

                             SATAN
                   The execution of Terrance and Phillip is
                   imminent, soon all hell shall rise!!

        Kenny looks scared.

                             SATAN
                       (Evil and scary)
                   Are you afraid, little one? Afraid for
                   the souls of your pitiful friends that-

        Suddenly, Saddam walks in carrying some bags.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey Satan!  I got some great new home
                   furnishings today!

        Satan rolls his eyes and sighs. His attempt to be evil to
        Kenny is squashed again.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Boy buddy Rich, it was a bitch to get
                   something to match with that bathroom
                   tile!

        Saddam looks at Kenny.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, hey kid. Find those proofs of
                   purchases yet? No?! Gee, whatta surprise!
                   Well, keep lookin!

        A beat. Satan folds his arms and looks at the floor, pissed.

                             SATAN
                   Do you wanna know what I did today?

        Saddam lets out a sigh.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   What did you do today Satan?

                             SATAN
                   You don't care.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey fella!  Relax!  This whole armageddon
                   thing has got you all stressed out. Let's
                   make love.

                             SATAN
                   Do you remember when you first got here?
                   We used to talk all night long. Until the
                   sun came up... We would just lie in bed
                   and TALK.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   That's because I wanted to fuck you,
                   dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those
                   pants down!

                             SATAN
                   Don't call me dumb!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I mean cute dumb. Now bend over!

        As this conversation happens, Kenny's eyes dart back and
        forth as if watching a tennis match.

                             SATAN
                   How come you always want to make love to
                   me from behind? Is it because you want to
                   pretend I'm somebody else?

        Saddam sighs.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Satan, your ass is gigantic and red, who
                   am I gonna pretend you are? Helen Reddy?

        A beat.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Come on, kid. Help me with these shower
                   curtains.

        Saddam and Kenny walk out. Leaving Satan all alone with sad
        music playing.

                             SATAN
                       (Gently)
                   Sometimes I think
                   When I look up real high
                   That there's a whole world up there
                   And just maybe it could be mine
                   But then, I sink
                   because it's here I'm supposed to
                   stay
                   but I don't even know how or why
                   its supposed to be that way-

        Satan walks to his veranda.

                             SATAN
                   Up there, there is so much room
                   Where babies burp and flowers bloom
                   Everyone dreams I can dream too
                   Up there, Up where
                   The skies are ocean blue
                   I could be safe and live without a
                   care... Up there

        Satan walks over to a bright blue globe and spins it slowly.

                             SATAN
                   They say I don't belong
                   That my place is down below
                   Because of my beliefs I'm supposed
                   to stay where evil is sewn
                   But what is evil anyway?
                   Is there reason to the rhyme?
                   Without evil there could be no good
                   So it must be good to be evil
                   sometimes
                   Up there, there is so much room
                   Where babies burp and flowers bloom.
                   Everyone dreams I can dream too
                   Up there, Up where
                   The skies are ocean blue
                   I could be safe and life without a
                   care... Up there

        PULL BACK, big crane shot rising above Satan.

        EXT. SMALL ABANDONED BUILDING - NIGHT

        A dim light is all that is visible from inside the small
        building.

        INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT

        Stan and Kyle are painting a sign on the wall 'La
        Resistance'.

        Cartman comes running in, he looks scared.

                             KYLE
                   You're late, Cartman!

                             CARTMAN
                   I had to ride my bike here. My behind is
                   killing me.

                             KYLE
                   Your behind?

                             CARTMAN
                   I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if
                   I say 'ass-
                       (BBZZAATT)
                   OW!!!

                             KYLE
                   Did you bring the pie and punch?

                             CARTMAN
                   No you guys... Something happened... You
                   guys wanna hear something creepy?
                       (Looking over each shoulder)
                   I don't think Kenny is dead.

                             STAN
                   What?

                             CARTMAN
                   I saw him last night!

                             KYLE
                   I know Cartman, I know.  I see Kenny
                   every day.

                             CARTMAN
                   YOU DO?!

                             KYLE
                   Sure, dude.  On the face of every child,
                   on the smile of every baby...

        Kyle and Stan laugh again.

                             CARTMAN
                   Hey!  I'm telling you this WAS Kenny! I
                   think he's haunting me.

        KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK!

        The boys all look scared.

                             KYLE
                   Somebody's here...

        The boys walk over to the door, and open the sliding panel in
        front of their eyes.

                             KYLE
                   Who is it?

                             VOICE
                   Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.

                             KYLE
                   What's the password?

                             VOICE
                   Uhh... I don't know.

                             KYLE
                   Guess.

                             VOICE
                   Uhh... Bacon.

                             KYLE
                   Okay.

        Kyle opens the door. The golden haired young boy from rehab
        stands there looking handsome and angelic.

                             GREGORY
                   Viva la Resistance.

                             STAN
                   Oh no, it's that kid.

                             GREGORY
                   This is the place--

        Another kid walks up next to Gregory, it's Wendy. Stan's eyes
        grow wide.

                             STAN
                   Wendy?

                             WENDY
                   Stan?! YOU started La Resistance?

                             GREGORY
                   Well, apparently you have a bigger heart
                   than we thought. Let us get this meeting
                   underway, there are others coming.

        Gregory takes Wendy's hand and pushes his way in. Stan fumes.

        INT. LA RESISTANCE - LATER

        Now the room is filled with a bunch of scared looking
        RESISTANCE FOLLOWERS. All of whom are under the age of
        twelve.

        The room is lit only by candlelight. And the large 'VIVA LA
        RESISTANCE' banner hands on the wall.

        Stan and Kyle look nervous.

                             STAN
                   Everyone be seated, please.

        The kids all sit down.

                             KYLE
                   Wow, a lot of people showed up.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, so what do we say?

                             KYLE
                   I thought you had something planned.

                             STAN
                   Me?!

        Stan looks out over the faces. Gregory checks his watch.

                             STAN
                       (Nervous)
                   Kay. Uh... Terrance and Phillip are
                   supposed to be killed, and we think that
                   sucks ass!!

        The kids don't respond. Stan shoots a nervous look at Wendy,
        who is sitting next to Gregory.

                             STAN
                   Uhh... So we think we should prank call a
                   bunch of policemen! We can have pizzas
                   sent to them that they didn't order! VIVA
                   LA RESISTANCE!!!

        Again no response. Gregory rolls his eyes.

                             STAN
                   Uhh...

        Gregory stands up.

                             GREGORY
                   May I?

                             STAN
                   What?

        Gregory takes Stan's place at the front of the group.

                             GREGORY
                   Terrance and Phillip are currently being
                   held at a Canadian Internment camp two
                   kilometers outside of town.
                   They are to be executed tomorrow during a
                   star-studded USO show for the troops.

        Gregory pulls a big map out of nowhere and rolls it out. Stan
        and Kyle can't believe it.

                             GREGORY
                   We must sneak into the camp through this
                   duct, freeing Terrance and Phillip
                   inside... The war is escalating, and the
                   American forces are preparing for a large
                   scale attack on Canada. That means the
                   time is now...

                             KYLE
                   Wow, dude, Wendy's new guy is smart.

        Stan shoots Kyle a dirty look.

                             GREGORY
                   This is a dangerous mission, so I'll go
                   myself.

        Wendy smiles at Gregory.

                             STAN
                   No!

        Everyone looks at Stan.

                             STAN
                   WE'RE going! WE started La Resistance to
                   save Terrance and Phillip! We're going!

                             GREGORY
                   This will be very dangerous... Are you
                   quite sure?

                             CARTMAN
                   Fuck that!
                       (BZZT)
                   AGAGH!!

                             STAN
                   We're going... Let's run through the
                   plan!!

        INT. SOUTH PARK - AMERICAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS

        A huge hall is filled with hundreds of soldiers in different
        battalions.

        We see our regulars: Mr. Garrison with a uniformed Mr. Hat,
        Mr. Mackey, Jimbo and Ned, Bo, Pip, Stan's Grandfather,
        Jesus, Officer Barbrady....

                             JIMBO
                   Oh, I'm so glad there's a war again. I
                   was gettin' worried I'd never see another
                   one!

                             NED
                   I know what you mean.

                             JIMBO
                   And they're giving all us troops a big
                   USO tomorrow with celebrities and
                   executions!

        PAN OVER to Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   You look great in your new uniform Mr.
                   Hat.

                             MR. HAT
                   You do too, Mr. Garrison.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Boy, I can't wait for our first shore-
                   leave so I can go get me some poontang.

        Chef sits down in a seat behind Garrison near the back.

        GENERAL PLYMKIN, a gruff old army type with bug eyes, steps
        up to a podium and addresses the troops.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   PAY ATTENTION!

        The crowd settles down.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   It's no secret that the Evil Canadian
                   Federation has scored major victories all
                   over the United State.  We have brought
                   you here because you ar America's best,
                   and last hope.

        Another general leans over to Plymkin and whispers in his
        ear.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Oh... Apparently you're not the best,
                   you're simply the last. Anyway, let's
                   strategize... Map!

        A large, holographic 3-D map of South Park springs up in
        front of him.  He walks around it pointing out things with a
        laser-pointer.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Our sources have told us that the
                   Canadians might try to attach tomorrow's
                   USO show and stop us from executing
                   Terrance and Phillip.

        He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Now each battalion has a specific code-
                   name and mission.  Battalion 5, raise
                   your hands-

        Chef is in Battalion 5 and dutifully raises his hand.

        Then he looks around and notices to his surprise that
        everybody else in his section is also African American.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   You will be the all-important first
                   defense wave, which we will call
                   'Operation Human Shield'.

                             CHEF
                   Hey, wait a minute...

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Now keep in mind, 'Operation Human
                   Shield' will suffer heavy losses.  But
                   don't lose your spirit men!  Stay until
                   the bitter end.  Battalion 14?

        A bunch of white guys raise their hands.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Right, you are 'Operation Get Behind The
                   Darkies'.  You will follow Battalion 5
                   here-

        He points to a spot on the 3-D map.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   -and try not to get killed for God's
                   Sake.  Are there any questions men?

        Chef raises his hand.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Yes soldier?

                             CHEF
                   Have you ever heard of the Emancipation
                   Proclamation?

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   I don't listen to hip-hop.

        Chef scowls.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   If you somehow live, we will regroup on
                   this hill outside--

        Suddenly, the 3-D hologram starts to flicker and fizzle.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Now what's wrong with this thing?

        General Plymkin messes with the controls.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Fucking windows 98!

        General Plymkin has pulled the plug. He stands there with
        the cord in his hands.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   GET GATES IN HERE!!!

        BILL GATES walks in, escorted by two MILITARY GUARDS.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   YOU TOLD US WINDOWS 98 WOULD BE FASTER
                   AND MORE EFFICIENT WITH BETTER ACCESS TO
                   THE INTERNET!!!

                             BILL GATES
                   It is faster, over five million--

        Plymkin pulls out a gun and shoots him in the head. Gates
        falls to the floor, dead.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Alright men, get lots of rest, and
                   prepare thyselves for battle!

        INT. LA RESISTANCE - NIGHT

        In the dead of night, the kids are all in a circle discussing
        the plan.

                             GREGORY
                   ...after you clear this zone here,
                   rendezvous behind this ridge where
                   Terrance and Phillip should be held.

                             KYLE
                   Gotcha.

                             GREGORY
                   You are indeed brave, but you will need
                   someone who's done this sort of thing
                   before.  MOLE!

        Suddenly, a bump in the ground starts to move forward, leaving
        a trail behind it. (like bugs bunny before he pops out)

        The bump comes to a stop at the children's feet and out pops
        THE MOLE.  He is a very bitter little nine year old French
        kid with a THICK French accent.

                             VOICE
                   Oui?

                             GREGORY
                   Thank you for coming, Mole.

                             THE MOLE
                   So... We must free more Canadian
                   prizoners?

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, I guess.

                             THE MOLE
                   America... She iz a beetch that sheets on
                   her own children.

        Stan and Kyle look at each other confused.

                             GREGORY
                   This is the Mole.  He will accompany you
                   to the prison where Terrance and Phillip
                   are.  He is an expert in covert
                   operations and a lifelong fighter for
                   freedom.

                             THE MOLE
                   Freedom... It's like cow's urine poured
                   down your troat. You wonder 'Do I want
                   this?' I'm thersty... But it's urine.

        Everyone stares at The Mole.

                             GREGORY
                   Good luck Stan, I'll make sure Wendy
                   is... kept safe?

        Stan gets pissed.

                             KYLE
                   Give me Terrance and Phillip or give me
                   death!!!

                             OTHERS
                   YEA!!!

        Now, Gregory breaks into song. His voice is absolutely
        gorgeous and deep. He puts his hand on Stan's shoulder.

                             GREGORY
                   God has smiled upon you this day
                   The fate of a nation in your
                   hands...

        Stan and Kyle look at each other. They can't believe how good
        this guy's voice is. Wendy appears enthralled.

                             GREGORY
                   As brothers and sisters we unite
                   And behind you we shall fight!
                   Until only the most righteous
                   belief stands!

        The music builds. Gregory gets up on a soapbox.

                             GREGORY
                   Do you see the distant flames?
                   they bellow in the night
                   Fight in all our names
                   For what we know is right
                   And if you all get shot and cannot
                   carry on
                   Though you die, La Resistance
                   lives on!

                             KYLE
                   What? Shot?

        Kyle and the boys look a little worried, as other kids join
        in the song.

                             KIDS
                   You might get stabbed in the head
                   by a dagger or a sword
                   You might be burned to death
                   or skinned alive or worse!

                             GREGORY
                   But when they torture you
                   You will not feel a need to run
                   For though you die, La Resistance
                   Lives on!

                             KIDS
                   Do you hear the beating drum?
                   It is our hearts all joined to one
                   It is the music of our souls
                   knowing we have much to overcome!

        As THE SONG CONTINUES we-

        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

        The MAC Mothers are on a stage, preparing two electric
        chairs.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Something must be done!
                   Tomorrow it will be!
                   We're going to execute this threat
                   to our democracy!

        All the mothers join in as they decorate the chairs with
        American flags. Kenny's mother is counting money she has made
        from selling t-shirts.

                             M.A.C. MOTHERS
                   And after that our kids will be

                   I want to be part of that world!
                   But if only I had the strength to
                   go without HIM...
                   If only I had the strength to leave
                   him behind...

        INT. MILITARY BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS

        The soldiers, including Garrison, Mackey, Ned and Jimbo are

                   Tomorrow we face our destiny!
                   Tomorrow we fight to keep our

                   Like our forefathers we shall
                   answer the call!

        PAN DOWN to Chef's bunk where he is lying naked with a hot
        chick. As usual, Chef sings a song that has absolutely no
        relevance to what's going on.

                             CHEF
                       (Stroking woman's arm)
                   Baby your thighs sparkle like
                   diamonds
                   Baby your butt is tender like the
                   night
                   I can see by the look in your pants
                   that you want to treat me right.
                   I'll whisper sweet nothings in your
                   cleavage
                   And you can kiss me gently with
                   your tongue
                   And I'll make love to you so deeply
                   That you'll feel pressure clear up
                   to your lungs.

        Meanwhile, the soldiers continue their song.

                             SOLDIERS
                   Something must be done!
                   Something's gotta give!

        Ike watches the soldiers march from his little attic window.

                             OFFICER (O.S.)

        Ike blinks.  Does he understand them? he picks up a small
        book and starts to write in it.

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Satan paces back and forth in hell.

                             SATAN
                   This is it! World War Three is at hand!
                   The millennium nears!

        Satan crosses to one of his small demons.

                             SATAN
                   Prepare the minions for the rising of
                   Gothos!

        The demon dashes off.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   This is so exciting! Let's fuck!

        Satan sighs and bows his head.

                             SATAN
                   This is the millennium, Saddam! This is
                   Armageddon! There's more to life than
                   sex!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, relax guy!

                             SATAN
                   Well I just want you to be impressed with
                   what I do. I want you to respect my MIND.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I DO respect your mind! It turns me on!
                   It makes me wanna fuck the shit out of
                   you! Don't you see?

        MUSIC BEGINS.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                       (Singing)
                   Hey guy, relax, put out
                   You gotta put out for me!
                   I'm just a man with needs
                   And right now I need your
                   generosity!
                   I love your eyes, your nose and
                   lips
                   So drop those pants and do some
                   dips
                   Come on guy, you gotta relax
                   relax, put out for me!

        Kenny looks confused.

                             SATAN
                   What if I, don't wanna put out?
                   That's all you ever say
                   Relax put out
                   I'm a living creature, I have
                   feelings too, I don't need this
                   abuse from you-

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, guy, relax, put out!
                   You gotta relax, shut your mouth-
                   Baby I'd do anything for ya!
                   Now don't make me smack you in the
                   eye like last time-

        Kenny keeps watching as Saddam throws on a Shakey's hat and
        does a quick softshoe. Satan rolls his eyes.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   I get what I want, and what I want
                   is for youuuuu toooo put ooooout!!!

        Saddam finishes the song and Satanhangs his head.

                             SATAN
                   What if I just left?

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides,
                   you know that if you left me, I'd hunt
                   you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna
                   go grab a drink.

        Saddam leaves. Satan looks about to cry, but then notices
        Kenny still standing there.

                             SATAN
                   What are you doing?! Get on with your
                   misery!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm?

                             SATAN
                   Him? I don't know... He can be nice...
                   sometimes.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm.

                             SATAN
                   What do you mean?! I could leave him if I
                   wanted to!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rm. Rmph rm rmph rm.

        Satan lowers his head. Slowly he starts to cry. Kenny walks
        over and pats him on the back.

        EXT. MILITARY COMPOUND

        Tents and makeshift buildings are lined up against the
        mountains.  Jeeps and Tanks buzz to and fro.

        There's a huge stage which is set up with thousands of seats.
        There's a giant banner reading "USO SHOW TONIGHT!!!!!"

        Loads of soldiers file into their seats.

                             ANNOUNCER
                   Alright you men! The USO show is about to
                   start!!

        The military men go wild.

                             ANNOUNCER
                   Get ready for loads of entertainment and
                   fabulous celebrities! To be followed
                   immediately by the swift and nasty
                   execution of Terrance and Elroy!

        The crowd goes crazy again.

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - BEHIND THE USO SHOW - DUSK

        Right out of Nazi Germany.  Barbed wire, guards, the whole
        bit.

        ANGLE ON BOYS

        They are on their backs, shimmying along the ground
        underneath the blanket of razor-wire that is set up around
        the camp.

        The Mole uses the bolt-cutters to cut the wire as he goes,
        clearing a path for Stan, Kyle and Cartman.

                             THE MOLE
                   Be careful not to touch this wire-

        A wire catches on Cartman's arm and SNAPS against his face.

                             CARTMAN
                   OW!  MOTHERFUCKER!

        BZZAAAAT!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   FUC-

        Stan shoves his hand over Cartman's mouth, leaving Cartman to
        cuss bloody murder into Stan's glove.

                             CARTMAN
                   MPHMPH MPHMPHMPH!!!

        BZAAT!

                             CARTMAN
                   MMMPPPHHH!!!

        Finally they clear the fence and lie down in view of the
        camp.

                             THE MOLE
                   It sounds like the USO show has started.
                   We have precious little time...

        Kyle looks at the horrible concentration camp.

                             KYLE
                   Oh my God...

                             THE MOLE
                   God? ...Let me tell you something about
                   God... He is ze biggest bitch of zem all.

        Kyle looks at The Mole, oddly.

                             STAN
                   How are we ever gonna find them?

        The Mole whips out some night vision goggles.

        ANGLE ON INTERMENT CAMP THROUGH NIGHT VISION GOGGLES

        The Mole inspects the camp.  He sees a guard on a guard
        tower.  Then he pans over to a bunch of Canadians standing
        in a line in rags.

        The Mole quickly clicks the magnification to high so we see
        the saddened faces of the Canadians.

                             KYLE
                   Do you see them?  Do you see Terrance and
                   Phillip?

                             THE MOLE
                   No. Zey must have zem inside. We will
                   have to dig.

                             KYLE
                   That's gonna take a long time!

                             THE MOLE
                   Time? Did time matter to the
                   Revolutionists who were forced to eat
                   their own shit while dying in the
                   dungeons of ze King?

        The boys think.

        EXT. USO SHOW - DAY

        Helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the USO show
        in Apocalypse Now.

        Groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the
        landing platform and touches down.  The US army men cheer.

        The mothers take the stage, and Kyle's mother speaks into the
        microphone. Behind her is a huge American flag. She is
        wearing an army helmet. This is right out of 'Patton'.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Ladies and gentlemen of the American war
                   effort, we salute you!

        A big cheer goes through the crowd. Kyle's mother feels the
        power, and lifts her head high. She starts to pace back and
        forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more
        Pattonlike.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Tomorrow you will be risking your lives
                   so that our children will have a better
                   future... God bless you men. And God
                   bless this filth free nation. Many of you
                   will die. Die like blood bathed pigs.  So
                   tonight, we at MAC present a NIGHT OF A
                   HUNDRED STARS! Now without further ado, I
                   give you...

        Out of the helicopter emerge a battalion of the best and
        brightest stars that the American show biz industry has to
        offer.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Pint size pixie and darling of the indie
                   movie scene, Winona Ryder!

        She gestures grandly to the helicopter where Winona Ryder
        emerges and runs to center stage and waves to the audience.
        She looks like a strung out coke addict; because she is.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   Hi guys!  I'm T.V.'s Winona Ryder!

        One guy claps.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   I want you all to know I'm super psyched
                   to be here today.  You guys rock.  What
                   you're doing for our country so sooo
                   cool.  It's so real.  I've been acting
                   since I was twelve and I can't
                   distinguish between make believe and real
                   life.

        Winona falls down. But gets back up immediately.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   And then I confuse me real life with my
                   big-screen one.  And sure, people get
                   hurt, and I'm sorry about that but
                   Christ, look at me.  It's not my fault
                   that I can get any guy I want.  And
                   that's reality to me.  But you guys...
                   wow.  I mean, war, man. Fucking war.  It
                   doesn't get any more real--  Now, this
                   one goes out to you.

        She cues the band which has been assembled from the same
        helicopter.  Jazz music starts up.

        It's 'New York, New York'. The troops look confused.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   You know what I'm gonna do for you now,
                   don't you?

        'New York, New York' continues to play.

                             WINONA RYDER
                   WRONG!
                       (Singing)
                   The bells are ringin'
                   For me and my gal!
                   The birds are singin'
                   For me and my gal!-
   
        INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - BELOW THE USO SHOW

        The mole is digging frantically while the boys follow on all
        fours.  Cartman holds a flashlight.

                             CARTMAN
                   Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't
                   know we were gonna get all dirty and
                   stuff.

                             THE MOLE
                   Sheet!

                             STAN
                   What is it?

                             THE MOLE
                   Bedrock!  I cannot dig any further in zis
                   direction!

                             STAN
                   We're going to die here like baby mice
                   who have had no milk in days.  Dry up
                   into crunchy little pinkies.

        The boys stare.

        A beat.

                             THE MOLE
                   Or, we can dig UP.

        The mole starts digging up towards the ground.

        EXT. INSIDE THE PRISON CAMP

        Mole pops his head out of the ground. Immediately, a search
        light passes over the hole.

                             THE MOLE
                   Sheet!

        Mole ducks, just avoiding the light.

        Slowly, the boys' heads appear from the hole.

        The whole camp is in front of them.  There is a HUGE
        barbedwire fence on one side (the side they just dug from)  A
        dozen armed guards with huge Dobermans patrol the grounds with
        Howitzers.  It doesn't look good.

                             THE MOLE
                   Move! Move!

        One by one, The Mole, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman pop out of the
        ground, and run for a nearby building.  Once at the building,
        they all duck to avoid the search lights.

                             THE MOLE
                   Okay.... The Americans must be holding
                   Terrance and Phillip in one of those
                   bunkers. We will split up here.  Let's
                   synchronize watches!

        The others look at each other.

                             KYLE
                   We don't have watches.

        A beat.

                             THE MOLE
                   You don't have watches?

                             STAN
                   Dude, you didn't say anything about
                   watches.

                             THE MOLE
                   What do you think this is kid?  Lick
                   Barney the Dinosaur's pussy fucking
                   kiddie hour?  Huh?  This is real life
                   with consequences you take to the grave!

                             KYLE
                   Dude, we don't have watches.

                             THE MOLE
                   Sheet.  Did you bring ze mirror?

                             STAN
                   Got it.

                             THE MOLE
                   And ze rope?

                             STAN
                   Check.

                             THE MOLE
                   And the butfor?

                             KYLE
                   What's a butfor?

                             THE MOLE
                   For pooping, silly.

        A beat... Then mole takes a long drag off his cigarette and
        slowly blows the smoke.

                             THE MOLE
                   Now listen carefully. Stan and Kyle, you
                   stand watch here and await my return. If
                   any guards come by, make a sound like a
                   dying giraffe.

                             KYLE
                   What's a dying giraffe sound like?

                             THE MOLE
                       (Putting his hands to his
                        mouth)
                   Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.

                             KYLE
                   Kay.

        The Mole turns to Cartman.

                             THE MOLE
                   Cartman, over zere, is the electrical
                   box. You must sneak over zere and shut it
                   off before I return with Terrance and
                   Phillip or the alarms will sound and I
                   will be shot full of holes. Got it?

                             CARTMAN
                   Okay.

                             THE MOLE
                   You MUST shut off the power, this is VERY
                   IMPORTANT do you understa-

                             CARTMAN
                   I HEARD YOU THE FIRST TIME! I'M NOT LOU
                   FERIGNO FOR PETE'S SAKE!

        Cartman storms off.

                             THE MOLE
                   I will tunnel my way into ze buildings,
                   and find ze prisoners.

        The Mole starts to dig.

                             KYLE
                   Be careful, dude.

                             THE MOLE
                   Careful? Was my mother careful when she
                   stabbed me in the heart with a clothes
                   hanger while I was still in ze womb?

        And with that, The Mole quickly starts to tunnel his way
        underground.

                             STAN
                   Damn, dude, that kid is fucked up.

        EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

        Back on stage at the USO show.  Winona Ryder is just
        finishing up her song.

                             WINONA RYDER
                       (Singing)
                   ....It's a hell of a TOWN!  And
                   that's my New York Melodyyyyyy!!!!

        The band finishes with a flourish. Winona takes a bow.

        One person in the entire audience claps.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Let's hear it again for the one and only
                   Winona Ryder!!!

        The same guy claps again.

                             ONE CLAPPING GUY
                   We love you, Winona!

        Everybody else in the audience just stares at him.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Next up we have a special treat...
                   Please welcome, direct from Vegas- BIG
                   GAY AL'S BIG GAY EXPERIENCE!!!

        The place goes wild as Big Gay Al walks out on stage.  Winona
        fumes in the wings.

                             RANDOM SOLDIER
                   This guy is the coolest!

                             RANDOM SOLDIER 2
                   Totally man!

        The back curtain goes up to reveal a tropical jungle set
        complete with a waterfall, hippos, monkeys and hundreds of
        colorfully dressed dancers.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   How we all feeling tonight?!

        Between the cheering, we hear a throng of "Happy!". Now the
        place is rocking!! Everybody loves Big Gay Al!

        Winona can't believe it.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I can't hear you...

                             CROWD
                   Happy!!!

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Friends, you know why I'm here... I'm
                   here to teach TOLERANCE!!

        The crowd cheers.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm here to say that we're all PEOPLE
                   under God, and we should embrace, and
                   accept our differences!!

        The crowd cheers louder.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   And that means we should LOVE CANADIANS
                   TOO!!

        The entire place goes incredibly quiet.

        You can hear a pin drop.

        Silence...

        Deafening silence...

                             BIG GAY AL
                   JUST KIDDING!! FUCK 'EM!!!

        Slow music swells in. Big Gay Al saunters around the stage
        and starts to sing.

                             BIG GAY AL
                       (Singing)
                   Bombs are flying
                   People are dying
                   Children are crying
                   Politicians are lying too
                   Cancer is killing
                   Texaco is spilling
                   The whole world's gone to hell
                   But how are you?

        Suddenly, Big Gay Al is wearing a big feathery outfit and all
        his dancers dash to his side.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm super!  Thanks for asking!
                   All things considered I'm doing
                   super

                   Very peachee

                   'Cause everything is super when

                   -don't you think I look cute in
                   this hat?

        The crowd is absolutely confused.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm so sorry, Mr. Cripple
                   But I just can't feel bad for you
                   right now
                   Because I'm feeling so insanely
                   super
                   That even seeing you in that chair
                   can't bring me down!

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ANOTHER AREA

        Cartman is by himself, slowly moving from building to
        building. He is scared out of his mind.

                             CARTMAN
                       (Imitating the Mole)
                   Shut of ze Power, Cartman. Zis is very
                   important, Cartman... Stupid British
                   piece of shi-
                       (BAZZT!)
                   OW!

        He approaches the electrical box.  Just as he's about to open
        it, two armed AMERICAN SOLDIERS round the corner.  Cartman
        gets scared and hides in the shadows.  The soldiers continue
        walking...

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Dude, if I was gay, I'd be just like Big
                   Gay AL!

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
                   Me too!!

        ...And pass a terrified Cartman.

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA

        The boys are waiting, bored, for The Mole to return.

                             KYLE
                   I don't think he's coming back, dude.

        Just then, we hear The Mole return from his hole. He is
        carrying the ticket guy from the movie theater.

                             TICKET GUY
                   Oh thank you! Thank you for getting me
                   out of there!! They locked me up for
                   selling movie tickets to minors!

                             THE MOLE
                   Is this one of zem?

                             KYLE
                   No! That's not Terrance or Phillip!

                             THE MOLE
                   Oh... Alright, back you go.

        The Mole takes the Ticket Guy back through the hole.

                             TICKET GUY
                   No! Please! I don't want to go back!!

        The boys sit back down and wait again.

        EXT. USO SHOW/STAGE - CONTINUOUS

        Meanwhile, Big Gay Al's song continues-

                             BIG GAY AL
                   I'm super! Thanks for asking!

                   this matching tie that I got at
                   Merv's?

        The chorus guys all pick Big Gay Al up and dance around with
        him on stage.

                             CHORUS
                   He's super! Thanks for asking!

                   Let's fight fight fight against
                   Canada today!!!!!!

        The song ends and everyone erupts into applause.

        INT. HELL - DAY

        Satan is looking into a large, oracle-like ball. Saddam isn't
        around, but a few demons and Kenny are hanging out.

                             SATAN
                   The execution is going to happen any
                   moment... We must prepare.

        The demons make excited noises.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm!

                             SATAN
                   Get everyone in hell ready. When the
                   blood of Terrance and Phillip spills, the
                   day is ours!

        Two of the demons head for Satan's room.

                             SATAN
                   No! Not Saddam. Don't wake him... Uh...
                   I'll tell him...

        Satan walks to the bedroom.

        EXT. INTERNMENT CAMP - ELECTRICAL BOX AREA

        Cartman approaches the electrical box nervously -- looking
        all around for soldiers.

        He opens the door to the electrical box and sees a large
        switch labeled ON and OFF.  He reaches to turn off the switch
        when he feels a tap on his shoulder.

        Cartman jumps.

                             CARTMAN
                   Agh!!!

        Then turns and karate-chops in one spastic flurry to see -
        KENNY!!

                             CARTMAN
                   Son of a gun!  HECK!

        Kenny's ghost is again floating in front of Cartman. Kenny
        again struggles to speak.

                             CARTMAN
                   GO AWAY, KENNY!  IT'S NOT MY GOSH DARN
                   FAULT!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmprmmh rm!!

                             CARTMAN
                   I don't have proofs of purchases from
                   Snacky Smores, Kenny!

                             KENNY
                   MPH RMPH RMPH RMPH RM!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AGAGAH!!

        Cartman runs off, leaving the power completely on.

        INT. KYLE'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT

        Ike is still just sitting quietly in the dark attic.

        Suddenly, the attic door bursts open!

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Found one!

        Other soldiers file into the attic and grab Ike by the arms.

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Yep, that's a Canadian alright.

                             IKE
                   Sibi mammama.

        The American Soldier picks up Ike.

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   So, thought you could hide from us, did
                   you?! Take him away!

        The soldiers drag Ike down the stairs.

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
                   Sir, look at this!
                       (Holding up a book)
                   He was writing some kind of diary...

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER
                   Diary?  What does it say?

                             AMERICAN SOLDIER 2
                       (Reading)
                   Cookie monster.  Banana.

        Sweeping, moving MUSIC STING.

        EXT.  INTERNMENT CAMP - STAN AND KYLE'S AREA

        Kyle is patiently awaiting Mole's return.

                             KYLE
                   Damn it! Come on, Mole we're running out
                   of time!

        Kyle spins around when he hears someone coming.

        But it's only Cartman. He's panting heavily.

                             CARTMAN
                   You guys! Seriously! You guys!

                             KYLE
                   What Cartman?!

                             CARTMAN
                   Kenny! I saw Kenny again!

                             STAN
                   Oh, brother.

                             KYLE
                   Did you shut the alarm off, Cartman?

        Cartman stops breathing heavily and thinks.

                             KYLE
                   Cartman?!

                             CARTMAN
                   Whoops.

        Just then, all the alarms in the place go off.

                             KYLE
                   Oh shit!

        From the distance, the boys hear gunshots.

        Suddenly, the Mole pops out of the hole. The boys see that
        The Mole has been shot up badly.

                             THE MOLE
                   Ze alarms! Zey went off!

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah... That was my bad, sorry.

        As SHOUTS and RUNNING FOOTSTEPS draw closer, The Mole lays
        down and begins to die in Kyle's arms.

                             THE MOLE
                   Please... Do not let ze resistance die...

        Gentle MUSIC begins.

                             THE MOLE
                   Now the light, she fades
                   And darkness closes in
                   But I will find strength
                   I will find pride within
                   Because although I die
                   Our freedom will be won
                   Though I die
                   Ze Resistance
                   Lives on...

        The Music fades away, as the Mole coughs up some blood.

                             THE MOLE
                   It's so very cold...

                             KYLE
                   We can't leave without you!

                             THE MOLE
                   It's okay, I am done for.

                             KYLE
                   No, I mean WE CAN'T LEAVE WITHOUT YOU -
                   we don't know where the hell we are!!

        The Mole coughs up more blood.

                             THE MOLE
                   Where is your God when you need him?
                   Where is your beautiful, merciful faggot
                   now?

        The Mole dies.

                             KYLE
                   SHIT!

                             VOICE
                   FREEZE!!

        The boys look up to see three large MARINES pointing guns at
        them.

        Stan makes a run for it. He dashes off at full speed.

                             KYLE
                   Run, Stan!!

        One of the soldiers fires at him. PWANG! PWANG! But Stan
        disappears into the night.

                             PENTAGON GUY
                   Forget him! The night will swallow him
                   up.

                             MARINE
                   You are under arrest!  Cuff 'em!

                             KYLE
                   What?

                             PENTAGON
                   So THIS must be the resistance the
                   pentagon has been tracking!

                             CARTMAN
                   Oh, son of a bitch...

        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

        Kyle's mother, and the other mothers of MAC, take the stage
        again.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And now, for our big finale, the MOMENT
                   YOU HAVE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR!!!

        Terrance and Phillip are wheeled out onto the stage.

                             TERRANCE
                   Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.

                             PHILLIP
                   I know, Terrance.  This is quite the
                   shitstorm we've found ourselves in this
                   time.

        From the other side, Kyle's mom appears with a couple of
        official looking military people.  The crowd cheers.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   It is my pleasure to present to you, THE
                   EXECUTION OF TERRANCE AND PHILLIP!!!

        The crowd cheers.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   Strap them in!

        Terrance and Phillip are then greeted by the EXECUTIONER,
        donned in a black hood.

        The scary giant Executioner grabs Terrance and Phillip and
        puts them into electric chairs.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   Today is a great day for democracy!

        The crowd cheers.

        The Executioner steps up to the throw switch.

                             TERRANCE
                   Phillip, this is worse than that trip to
                   Quebec City when I fell asleep in that
                   disco.

                             PHILLIP
                   I know, Terrance. I know.

        EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

        LONG SHOT of a desolate, dark area.

        It has started to rain. Stan trudges through the wilderness
        looking tired and scared.

                             STAN
                   Hello? Where the hell am I? Is anybody
                   here?

        A few wolf HOWLS sound in the distance. Stan walks on.

                             STAN
                   MARCO!!!

        No answer.

                             STAN
                   MARCO!!!

        No answer. Stan stumbles a bit.

                             STAN
                   Dude, weak... Can't go on... Dizzy...

        Stan falls to the ground. His face plops in the rainy mud and
        his head smacks against a rock.

        Stan is out cold.

        Just then, a strange sound emerges. It is like a pulsating
        WOBBLE. Stan slowly awakes, picks up his head and shines his
        flashlight around.

                             STAN
                   What is that?

        The sound gets louder. Stan shines his flashlight on
        something that is huge and throbbing.

                             STAN
                   OH MY GOD!!!

        EXT. STAGE - NIGHT

        Kyle's mother approaches Terrance and Phillip.

                             KYLE'S MOM
                   Gentlemen, do you have any last words?

                             PHILLIP
                   Last words? Let's see... How aboot "GET
                   ME THE FUCK OUT OF THIS CHAIR". How's
                   that for last words?

        Kyle's mom nods to the Executioner.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   WAIT!!

        General Plymkin walks out next to Kyle's mother.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   We have just captured some Canadian
                   Sympathizers!

        The crowd cheers. Kyle's mother smiles.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   We will execute them along with Terrance
                   and Phillip for your viewing pleasure!

        Another cheer. The mothers are all very pleased. That is,
        until they see Kyle and Cartman brought out to the stage at
        gunpoint.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Kyle?!

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Eric?

                             KYLE
                   Hi, ma.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   We also have a Canadian SPY who was
                   hiding out in South Park!!

        Now Ike is brought out at gunpoint.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Ike?!

        Kyle's mother rushes over to General Plymkin.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   General... These are OUR CHILDREN!

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   They are Canadian sympathizers and they
                   must be dealt with accordingly!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   But they're CHILDREN!

        Cartman walks over to where Terrance and Phillip are strapped
        into their chairs.

                             CARTMAN
                   Dude! Terrance and Phillip! Wow! Can I
                   get your autographs?!

                             TERRANCE
                   Sure, tubby, just as soon as we're
                   killed.

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   We can't kill these kids!

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Listen mothers, YOU'RE the ones that
                   started all this. Don't get all emotional
                   NOW!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   But we're doing all this to help our
                   children's futures!

                             CARTMAN'S MOTHER
                   Yes, I think shooting our children would
                   adversely affect their futures.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   No... The General is right.

                             KYLE
                   MOM!!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Boobie... This is the only way you're
                   ever going to learn. I have an
                   opportunity here to teach you about
                   consequences.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Sheila, you're going to far! Those are
                   YOUR children!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO
                   BE RUINED BY SMUT!!
                       (To Kyle)
                   I am sorry young man, but I have had it
                   up to here! STRAP THEM IN!

        She walks away.

                             KYLE
                   YOU GOTTA BE FUCKING KIDDING ME!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   KYLE BROVLOFSKI, YOU WATCH YOUR
                   LANGUAGE!!

        EXT. IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

        Stan is still lying in mud, but now he lies before a HUGE,
        pulsating, organic looking thing that belongs in the X-Files.
        It's the size of a small building.

        The massive thing starts to glow. Stan looks weak and afraid.

                             BIG THING
                   Be not afraid...

        Stan trembles.

                             STAN
                       (Weakly)
                   What...

                             BIG THING
                   Behold my glory.

                             STAN
                   What... are you?

                             BIG THING
                   I am the clitoris.

        Stan's eyes grow wide. MUSIC starts to swell up.

                             STAN
                   The clitoris?! I DID IT!! I FOUND THE
                   CLITORIS!!

                             BIG THING
                   Stan, your friends need you. They are in
                   trouble and you must help them.

                             STAN
                   Wait, you're supposed to tell me how to
                   get Wendy to like me.

                             BIG THING
                   There are more important matters right
                   now...

                             STAN
                   NO WAY, DUDE! I'VE LOOKED ALL OVER FOR
                   YOU, AND NOW YOU HAVE TO TELL ME HOW TO
                   GET WENDY TO LIKE ME!!

                             BIG THING
                   Dude, she's eight years old, just get her
                   some ice cream or something.

                             STAN
                   Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!

                             BIG THING
                   Now go, your friends are in danger... The
                   USO show is a mile east of here, just
                   over that ridge. The clitoris has spoken.

        The clitoris fades, and just as it does, all the kids of La
        Resistance come running into frame. Wendy and Gregory are
        with them as well.

                             WENDY
                   Stan! Stan are you okay?!

                             STAN
                   Wendy?

                             GREGORY
                   I see you failed in your mission.
                   Terrance and Phillip must be dead by now.

        Wendy bends down to pick up Stan.

                             WENDY
                   Come on Stan, we have to hurry. The
                   Canadian forces are about to attack!!

        Wendy pulls Stan up off the ground and slings his arm around
        her.

        EXT. USO SHOW - NIGHT

        A drummer plays as the execution begins.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   We begin with Terrance and Phillip!!!
                   Throw the switch!!!

        The executioner throws the switch and Terrance and Phillip
        start to fry. Kyle, Cartman and Ike, in their chairs, look
        horrified.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Goodbye, bastards!

        Near death, Terrance cranks out a weak fart. Terrance and
        Phillip both laugh weakly but merrily.

                             TERRANCE
                   Take that, bitch.

        As Terrance and Phillip fry, they scream out:

                             PHILLIP/TERRANCE
                   FREEEEEEDOMMMMM!!!

        Suddenly, FWWOOOMMM!!! A Bomb lands in the middle of the
        army. BLAM!! It explodes with incredible force, sending dead
        bodies in all directions.

        Canadian military planes zoom overhead! It's a full scale
        attack!!

        From a HIGH ANGLE we see the soldiers all scatter like bugs
        in every direction.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   THE CANADIANS ARE ATTACKING!! RUN FOR
                   YOUR LIVES!!

        FWWOOMM!!! BLAMM!! Another explosion!  Everybody just starts
        screaming and shooting in every direction.  Total and
        complete mayhem.

        One explosion knocks out the electricity, and Terrance and
        Phillip stop drying.

        The electricity runs along a wire, across the stage, and
        right up Cartman's leg. Cartman starts frying horribly.

                             KYLE
                   CARTMAN!

                             CARTMAN
                       (Frying)
                   WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!

                             PHILLIP
                   What's going on Terrance?

                             TERRANCE
                   Canada is saving us!!

        Finally, Cartman is blown clear of the electricity. Kyle
        picks him up and starts to run along with Ike.

        INT. HELL - SATAN'S BEDROOM

        Satan opens the door to find Saddam sleeping happily in his
        cozy bed. He is only wearing little black g-string panties.

                             SATAN
                       (Whispering)
                   Have you finished?

        Now we see that Kenny is standing at the foot of the bed. He
        holds a gasoline can, and has just finished pouring the last
        drops underneath the bed.

                             KENNY
                   Mph mph.

                             SATAN
                   Then move out of the way.

        Kenny walks over next to Satan. Satan pulls out a book of
        matches.

                             SATAN
                   I must be strong... I must be strong...

        Satan tries to light the match. It won't light.

                             SATAN
                   Damn it...

        Finally, the match lights. Satan holds it up-

                             SATAN
                   Goodbye, Saddam...

        -and throws it onto the bed.

                             SATAN
                   Come on!

        Saddam burns to a crisp and Satan and Kenny run out.

        EXT. USO SHOW - DAY

        People run screaming in all directions as a full scale attack
        has broken out. Gunfire, explosions and dead bodies fly all
        around.

                             JIMBO
                   Ned!  Behind you!

        Ned whips around and mows down a line of Canadians. But one
        Canadian makes it through, and sticks his bayonet through
        Ned's neck.

        Blood gushes from Ned's neck as he collapses.

                             JIMBO
                   NED!!! NOOOOOOO!!!!!

        FWWOOM!! BLAMMM!!! The boys runs as fast as they can amidst
        the explosions.

                             CARTMAN
                   HOLY SHIT!
                       (Zap)
                   AGHAGHGAH!!

        Now when the V-chip shocks Cartman, we can actually see the
        blue current swirl around his body.

                             CARTMAN
                   HEY! THIS V-CHIP IS GETTING ALL SCREWY!!

        General Plymkin has followed his men into the trench, where
        explosions and gunfire fly all around. He pulls out a walkie
        talkie as his men die all around him.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   ALRIGHT MEN!!!  FALL INTO FORMATION!
                   "HUMAN SHIELD" UP FRONT THEN "OPERATION
                   GET BEHIND THE DARKIES"!!!

        They all fall in.  A phalanx of black men, Chef included in
        them, walk out in front of a bunch of white guys.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   REMEMBER, HUMAN SHIELD!  PROTECT OUR
                   TANKS AND PLANES, TOO!

        Just then, over a ridge in front of them, a line of Canadian
        tanks appears. The tanks are lined up 3 deep.  Behind them is
        a line of missile launchers.  General Plymkin's jaw drops.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   Holy Mother of Johosephat...

        The black guys all look at each other nervously.

        EXT. BATTLEFIELD

        The boys run through the chaos.  Body parts and scrapnel fly
        here and there.

        A bloody soldier suddenly stumbles and falls in front of the
        boys holding a massive head wound.

                             KYLE
                   Hey! It's Mr. Garrison!!

        Garrison lies on the ground, coughing up blood.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Children... Take Mr. Hat... Please... Get
                   him out of here...

        Garrison takes Mr. Hat off his hand and gives it to Cartman.

        Just then, Garrison goes limp.

        Cartman looks at the Mr. Hat in his hand and scowls. The boys
        run from the battle.

        They pass the American troops, where all the black guys are
        standing in a human shield around the white guys.

                             CHEF
                   Alright, squad... JUST LIKE I TOLD YOU...
                   ONE!!

        The Canadian tanks take aim.

                             CHEF
                   TWO!

        The Canadian tanks fire.

                             CHEF
                   THREE!!

        All the black guys suddenly jump out of the way, leaving the
        whites completely exposed.

                             GENERAL PLYMKIN
                   What the-

        The tank fire hits the army, blowing all the white soldiers
        to smithereens, including Ned and Jimbo.

                             BLACK SOLDIER
                   GREAT PLAN, CHEF!

                             CHEF
                   Operation Human Shield my ASS!

        EXT. SOUTH PARK - DAY

        From an EXTREME WIDE SHOT, we see all the forces on both
        sides exchange firepower. The Canadian National anthem can be
        heard in the distance.

        We see Mr. Mackey looking like a natural born killer.  He
        shoots like a maniac into the Canadians.  He wounds one and
        then marches over to the wriggling body with a knife.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Die Canadian, mmkay?!

        And he drives the knife into the Canadian's chest.

        But then, suddenly, another Canadian Soldier appears out of
        nowhere, and blows a hole through Mackey's chest.

                             MR. MACKEY
                   Mkay-

        Mackey falls to the ground, dead. Just then Big Gay Al runs
        through the frame, we FOLLOW him as he skips his way around
        gunfire.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Ooh! Goodness those bullets are going
                   FAST!!!

        Another bullet zings by his head.

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Jumping Jesus, this is insane!!

        THUMP! A bullet hits Big Gay Al square in the head. More
        bullets follow, tearing him to shreds.

        WIDE ANGLE ON - ENTIRE BATTLE

        This shot parodies one of the big shots from 'Saving Private
        Ryan'. Just complete overkill. Explosions, helicopters,
        gunfire and death.

        Kyle's mother, and the other mothers as well, stand on a
        ridge overlooking the horrific massacre.

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   My God... This is terrible...

        Kyle's mother holds out her M-16. She is now completely
        insane.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   This is what we wanted! We wanted our
                   children to be brought up in a smut-free
                   environment!!!

                             KENNY'S MOTHER
                   But we didn't want THIS. I just followed
                   you 'cause I made a shitload of money
                   selling Kenny t-shirts!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   Oh Lord, what have we done...?

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Wake up, people!  We all have to do
                   things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's
                   the not pretty things that make life
                   worth fighting the not pretty things for!
                   Why do you think children have to be born
                   in hospitals?

        The other mothers look very confused.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Why does it matter?! My plan is a perfect
                   plan!!  Perfect!  Perfect! Perfect!!!!!

        The other mothers walk away.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the
                   not pretty things from letting our
                   children be born in hospitals!

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   We're going to find our boys! For God's
                   sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!

        Kyle's mother turns back to the battle. More killing and
        explosions.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Killed.  They should only be so lucky.
                   Kyle wasn't even BORN in a hospital!

        She charges the field.

        EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS

        Terrance and Phillip are dodging gunfire and super loud
        explosions.

                             PHILLIP
                   Did you hear that, Terrance? I farted!

                             TERRANCE
                   You did? Just now?

        They laugh merrily.

                             PHILLIP
                   Come on, we can take shelter in one of
                   those buildings!

        But just then, Kyle's mother comes charging in with her gun!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   AAAGHGAHGHGH!!! YOU DESTROYED MY
                   FAMILY!!!!!!!!!!

        Phillip spins around just in time to see Kyle's mother
        plunge her bayonet into Terrance's abdomen.

                             TERRANCE
                   AGH!

                             PHILLIP
                   Terrance! NO!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   DIE!!!!!!

        SLOW MOTION SHOT -

        Blood from Terrance's abdomen slowly spills from his stomach.

        Everything gets SILENT as we follow the blood down, down,
        down...

        Until it hits the ground with a huge, echoing BWOOOMMMM!!!

        CLOSE UP on Kyle's mother's eyes.

        CLOSE UP on the spot of blood on the ground...

        BACK TO REAL TIME

        Suddenly, the ground starts to open up! FWOOM!! Great flames
        and ash take over the sky.

        Satan and his minions explode from below. Everyone stops
        fighting for a moment, to watch this amazing spectacle.

                             SATAN
                   RAAGHGH!!!! MY TIME HAS COME!!!

        Demons and flames emerge from the ground. All the soldiers on
        both sides can't believe what they're seeing.

        Now out of the giant abyss comes Kenny. He dusts himself off
        and looks around.

        EXT. TRENCH - NIGHT

        As more bombs and gunshots go off. Kyle, Cartman and Ike
        huddle close to each other in a trench.

                             CARTMAN
                   Kyle... All those times I said you were a
                   big dumb Jew... I didn't mean it. You're
                   not a Jew.

        Kyle thinks.

                             KYLE
                   Yes I am!

                             IKE
                   Baba mama!

        Another explosion rocks the trench. Dirt flies all over the
        boys' heads.

                             CARTMAN
                   AGH!
                       (Noticing Mr. Hat in his hand)
                   What the hell am I still holding this
                   for?!

        Cartman tosses Mr. Hat out of the trench. We hear GUNSHOTS
        and then VERY FAINTLY we hear Garrison's voice.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   Mr. Hat! Noooooo!

        Suddenly, Stan jumps down into the trench.

                             KYLE
                   Stan!

                             STAN
                   Dude, I found the clitoris! I think I can
                   get Wendy to like me now!

                             KYLE
                   Sweet.

                             CARTMAN
                       (Sarcastic)
                   Oh, that's swell, Stan. I guess all's
                   well that ends well, huh? We can go home
                   now. There's just one little thing left
                   to tie up... WORLD WAR THREE!!!

        More explosions go off. Dead bodies fly all around the boys.

        Suddenly, Kenny appears before the boys.

                             CARTMAN/KYLE
                   AGAGAH!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   It's him! I told you!! Kenny's come to
                   take us to the netherworld!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rmph rmph?!

                             KYLE
                   Wait! He's not haunting us, he's trying
                   to tell us something!

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rm rmph rm!

                             CARTMAN
                   Okay!  We can get you some proofs of
                   purchases for Snacky Smores Kenny!  Just
                   mellow the heck out!

        EXT. SOMEWHERE IN SOUTH PARK - NIGHT

        More battle. People are dying left and right.

        The Doctor from the Hospital scene runs in with an M-16. A
        Canadian steps in front of him, the doctor shoots, and blows
        the Canadian's head clean off.

                             DOCTOR GAUCHE
                   Hey, pal, don't lose your head.

        Suddenly, the ticket guy's chest rips open. He falls dead,
        and standing behind him is a Canadian with a double barreled
        shotgun.

                             CANADIAN SOLDIER
                   I'm glad you got that off your chest.

        Tom the Rhinoplasty surgeon leaps in and stabs the Canadian
        through the head with his bayonet.

                             TOM
                   I guess he got the point.

        A Canadian rushes in and machine guns Tom full of holes.

                             CANADIAN SOLDIER 2
                   Plastics are a cheap and efficient
                   insulator for electrical applications.

        Just as the fighting escalates, Satan and his minions rush
        in.

                             SATAN
                   Yes! Good! Fight and kill one another!

        The soldiers all look scared and puzzled.

                             SATAN
                   You're all part of Satan's army now!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   What the hell is going on?!

        Satan gets in Kyle's mother's face.

                             SATAN
                   I am the dark master!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I
                   don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!

                             SATAN
                   SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh.

                             SATAN
                   YOU HAVE SPILLED THE BLOOD OF THE
                   INNOCENTS. NOW THE WORLD BELONGS TO ME...
                   NOW BEGINS TWO MILLION YEARS OF
                   DARKNESS!!  AND ALL THANKS TO YOU!!!

        Kyle's mother backs down, ashamed.

                             CHEF
                   Oh, good job, Mrs. Broflofski, thanks a
                   lot.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   I... I was just trying to make the world
                   a better place for children...

                             SATAN
                   Yes... And in doing so, you brought
                   enough anger and intolerance to the world
                   to allow my coming.

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   And I thought my mother was the master of
                   guilt.  Geez Louise.

                             SATAN
                   SILENCE!!!  NOW!!!  EVERYONE BOW DOWN TO
                   ME!!!

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Oh God... What have I done...

        One by one, the soldiers start to kneel.

        Satan throws his arms up in the air and laughs a horrible,
        deep laugh that fills the world.

        But just then, the ground shakes again. Satan looks over to
        the huge abyss he had crawled out of and notices another
        figure.

        He is burnt horribly, but it is Saddam. He holds a martini
        glass in his hand.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, I'm missing the party!

                             SATAN
                   No! It can't be!

        Saddam, burnt to a crisp, walks over to Satan and grabs his
        ass.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Did you miss me, buttercup?
                       (Yelling out)
                   All right, gang! I am your new ruler now!
                   Everyone bow down to ME!!

        Satan puts his head down.

                             KYLE
                   HOLD EVERYTHING!!!

        Kyle walks up with Cartman, Stan and Kenny.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Oh, it's the bratty kid from hell.

                             KYLE
                   You made a deal with Kenny that if he got
                   ten proofs of purchases from Snacky
                   Smores you'd grant him any wish.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   And?

        Kenny pulls out the proofs of purchases. TRIUMPHANT MUSIC
        plays.

                             SATAN
                   I TOLD you not to make that deal, Saddam!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Who gives a fuck?! I was just fucking
                   with him!

                             KYLE
                   What?

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   The deal's off, go away, guy.

                             SATAN
                   No, Saddam. You made a deal. You can't
                   just renege on a deal. That's lying.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Relax bitch!  You're better seen, not
                   hear okay?

        Saddam smacks Satan in the face. Now Satan looks mad, but he
        sits down like a good little bitch.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Now, let's start torturing people, shall
                   we? We'll start with...
                       (Looks at Cartman)
                   THIS little fat kid first!!

                             CARTMAN
                   AY!  Don't call me fat, buttfucker-

        ZAP!!  A huge CHARGE shoots from Cartman, knocking one of
        hell's demons on his ass.

                             STAN
                   Holy shit Cartman!  What was that?!

                             CARTMAN
                   How the fuck should I know!!

        ZAP!!! Another huge CHARGE emits from the v-chip inside
        Cartman and sends the other Swedish Soldier reeling.

                             KYLE
                   Look at that!

                             CHEF
                   It's that v-chip thing that's inside you,
                   Eric!  The polarity must have been
                   reversed by the electric chair!

                             TERRANCE
                   Oh boy!

        A smile comes across Cartman's face.

                             CARTMAN
                   BUTTFUCKING SHIT!

        BZZZZZZZZT!   A huge charge busts the chains that hold
        Cartman's wrists.

        He jumps down.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yes!

        TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays as Cartman uses his newly found power.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Quick, Satan!  Do something!

        But before Satan can do anything, Cartman holds up his hands
        and lets loose.

                             CARTMAN
                   FUCK A HUNK A SHIT, YOU RAT FUCK!!!

        BZZZZZZZZZAAT!!!!  A charge hits Satan square between the
        eyes and knocks him down.

        He gets to his knees and stands up again.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey, you need to watch your mouth, brat!

                             CARTMAN
                   Try this on for size-

        Cartman holds up his hands.

                             CARTMAN
                   DRIPPING VAGINA EATING SON OF A
                   PIGFUCKING CRACK WHORE!!! HAIRY COCK
                   SLURPING MAGGOT FUUUUUCK!!!!

        BZZZAAAAT!!

        The charge hits Saddam in the chest.  He drops again.

        Saddam looks around and is suddenly scared.  He appeals to
        Cartman.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Hey buddy!  No need to stress! Let me
                   make you a deal!  How about a lifetime
                   supply of Snacky Smores and we just
                   forget about this whole thing?!

                             KYLE
                   Don't listen to him, Cartman!

                             KENNY
                   Mrphmmmph!!!

                             CARTMAN
                   (giving in)  Okay.  (then)  Not.

        Cartman closes his eyes and hums like he's summoning up the
        worst words in the world.

        Then, it comes out.  Like a volcano.

                             CARTMAN
                   SUCK THE HOT SHIT FROM MY GURGLING ASS
                   YOU BLOOD DRENCHED FROZEN TAMPON ON A
                   STIIIIIIIIIIICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZATTTTTTTTT!!!!!

        A huge purple jolt emerges from each of Cartman's hands and
        joins into one powerful current that hits Saddam.  Saddam is
        thrown back against the wall.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                       (To Satan)
                   What are you waiting for, bitch?! Destroy
                   him!!

        Satan looks at Cartman, then at Saddam, and thinks...

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Come on you weak, stupid cum bucket! Save
                   me!!

        Satan stands there.

                             SATAN
                   Help you? You've destroyed my life and
                   now you want me to help you?!  You're
                   always making me feel like a piece of
                   shit.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Come on guy, you know I only rib you
                   because I love you so much!

                             SATAN
                   If you love somebody then you treat them
                   with respect!  You've never respected me!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Can we talk about this later?  Everyone
                   is watching!

                             SATAN
                   I don't care!  I want to talk about it
                   now!

        Saddam grabs Satan by the arm.

                             SATAN
                   Ow, you're hurting me!

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Listen guy, you're embarassing me in
                   front of my friends!  You know how I get
                   mad when I get embarassed.

        Satan starts getting really mad.  Steam starts coming from
        his nostrils.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Your little problems can wait til later,
                   see?

        Steam starts coming out of Satan's nostrils.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   Now do what I say and keep your fucking
                   mouth shut!

                             SATAN
                   THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!

        Satan picks up Saddam, and throws him over a huge, flaming
        cliff, back into the depths of hell.

                             SADDAM HUSSEIN
                   NOOOOOOOOOOOOoooooooooo!!!!! Heeeeyyyy
                   guyyyyy, relaaaaaxx.....

                             CHEF
                   Saddam Hussein is dead!

                             STAN AND KYLE
                   Hooray!!!

        Everyone cheers.

                             PHILLIP
                   You're quite a purveyor of filth, little
                   boy!

                             TERRANCE
                   Indeedy, that was a delicious choice of
                   words!

                             CARTMAN
                   Well, I learned it all from you guys.

                             PHILLIP
                   Of course you did, cock fuck!

        They all laugh merrily.

        Satan stands over the cliff, looking down at where Saddam
        fell.

                             SATAN
                   He spent so much time convincing me I was
                   weak and stupid that I believed it
                   myself.

        The boys look at each other, confused.

                             SATAN
                   Saddam didn't respect me.  All he wanted
                   was sex.  But it took me so long to
                   figure that out.

        He starts to cry.  Chef hands him a hanky.

                             CHEF
                   Here you go Satan-

                             SATAN
                   Thank you. Give me the proofs of
                   purchases.

        Kenny hands them to Satan.

                             SATAN
                   Okay Kenny, I will keep the bargain. Any
                   wish you want is yours.

        TRACK IN slowly on Kenny. MUSIC BUILDS. Finally, Kenny
        speaks.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rmph rmpg rmph mm.

        Everyone GASPS!!

                             KYLE
                   WHAT?

                             STAN
                   Are you sure, Kenny?

                             SATAN
                   What did he say?

                             STAN
                   He said that his wish is for everyone who
                   died in the war to come back.

                             CHEF
                   Kenny, you realize this wish is the only
                   chance for YOU not to be dead...

                             KENNY
                   M mprh. Mph rmph rm rmph rm rmphm rmphm.
                   Mm rmphm rmphm rhmphm.

        Triumphant music plays, as if Kenny is giving a grand,
        important speech.

                             SATAN
                   Very well, then. I will put an end to the
                   war as your wish and make everything as
                   it was before the war started. But you
                   Kenny, must remain dead.

                             KENNY
                   Mph rm.

        Satan turns to the open abyss.

                             SATAN
                   I must admit, I'm kind of relieved. It's
                   too fucking cold up here.

                             STAN
                   Aren't there cold parts of hell?

                             SATAN
                   Yeah, but it's a real dry cold. Here it's
                   the humidity that gets me. I guess I'm
                   destined to live in hell... alone...

        Sadly, Satan walks back down the trench into hell. But
        something catches his eye.

                             SATAN
                   Hello... What's this?

        Satan bends down and picks up Mr. Hat. He looks at it, and
        then places it gently on his hand.

                             SATAN
                   Hi there, little guy... Would you like to
                   go to hell with me?

                             SATAN (AS MR. HAT)
                   Sure. I bet we can be best friends!

        Satan smiles. And walks down to hell with Mr. Hat.

        The boys walks over to Kenny.

                             KYLE
                   Thank you, Kenny.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for
                   us. You're a real pal.

        A bright red light flashes and Satan and his minions are
        dragged back down into hell. Kenny is taken along with them.

        At the same time, Garrison, Jimbo, Mackey and all the others
        who died, suddenly and magically appear. They look at
        themselves, wondering what just happened.

        Everyone just stands around in a daze. Canadians and
        Americans alike look at each other and wonder what to do.

                             MR. GARRISON
                   I... I'm alive... Where's Mr. Hat?

                             BIG GAY AL
                   Wow... We were all killed and now we're
                   fine. That's super!

                             KYLE
                   Whew, I'm sure glad that's over.

                             STAN
                   Yeah, but you know, I learned something
                   today.  I learned that getting all worked
                   up over fuck and shit and cockmaster is
                   just stupid... You all focused so hard on
                   erasing profanity that you forgot the
                   most important thing... To love each
                   other.

                             CARTMAN
                   Yeah! You're all a bunch of stupid sons a
                   bitches!

        The boys' parents walk up.

                             STAN
                   Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going
                   to have fun with profanity just like you
                   and dad did when you were little.

                             KYLE
                   Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or
                   dicksucker or, or-

                             KYLE'S MOTHER
                   Shiteater-

                             STAN'S MOTHER
                   -Or monkey fucker-

        They all laugh merrily at their naughtiness.

        Wendy walks up to Stan.

                             WENDY
                   I'm sorry Stan, I guess you really DO get
                   it after all!

        Stan smiles. MUSIC swells.

                             STAN
                   Wendy... How would you like to go get
                   some ice cream?

                             WENDY
                   Sure, Stan! How did you know I loved ice
                   cream?

                             STAN
                   My friend the clitoris told me.

                             WENDY
                   Wow, I have a clitoris too.

                             STAN
                   Really? Where the hell do you keep it?
                   It's huge.

        Wendy grabs Stan and plants a big kiss on him. Stan vomits
        into Wendy's mouth.

                             STAN
                   But Wendy... What about Gregory?

        Gregory stands off to one side, scowling.

                             WENDY
                   Stan, I never cared for Gregory.

                             STAN
                   You didn't?

                             WENDY
                   No, dude. Fuck him. Fuck him in the ear.

                             STAN
                   Cool!

                             WENDY
                       (Singing)
                   Thank my lucky stars
                   Here before me now
                   Is everything I'd ever hoped for-

                             STAN
                   Knew it in a word
                   Saw it in a glance
                   The only thing I think I'd die for

                             STAN AND WENDY
                   I can't stop now... My heart's
                   awake!
                   I pray your arms my arms to take!
                   So this is why I'm alive!

        Now everyone joins hands and starts singing-

                             EVERYONE
                   SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE, UNCLEFUCKA!
 YOU'RE A COCK SUCKING ASS RAPING UNCLEFUCKA! YOU'RE AN UNCLEFUCKA, YES IT'S TRUE! NOBODY FUCKS UNCLES QUITE LIKE YOU!                    UNCLEFUCKAAA!!!

        Kenny's mom and dad come up.

                             KENNY'S DAD
                   This is all so wonderful.  I just wish
                   our little Kenny could see all of this
                   joy.

                             KYLE
                   Oh he can, dude.  Look!

        Kyle points to the sky.  Everyone looks up just in time to
        see a brilliant shooting star across the daytime sky.

        We follow the shooting star and then slowly ZOOM in on it.
        As we get closer, we realize it is actually Kenny, shooting
        towards the heavens.
   
        As TRIUMPHANT MUSIC plays, Kenny's little body floats up and
        up through the clouds. (NOTE:  This will also be done in 3-D
        CGI)

        Rays of light from above bathe his body and he flies up into
        the warmth of the baby blueness.

        Angels encircle him and give him a pair of wings.  They smile
        gently.  He feels calm.  He feels good.

        Amidst a group of angels, Kenny flies upwards and finally...
        into Heaven.

                                                                  END.

                            SHOOTING DRAFT





    FADE IN:


1   INT. BEDROOM - MEDIUM CLOSE - MALE FORM - LATE AFTERNOON      1

    A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man's
    back..... a perfect back... good dark color, slim, muscular.
    LATIN MUSIC PLAYS... a song.... if you understood the words
    you would hear love confronted and considered in a very
    specific way...We are in a Mexico City suburb. The day is
    hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man's back, the
    first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red
    fingernails come into view...and now a woman's hand goes
    beautifully to work...part sensual back scratch, part
    massage. The hand cups bits of the man's back, a strong thumb
    probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top of his
    ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down --
    and, as the hand rises once more to the top of his back for
    another trip down his upper body...
    MAIN TITLES BEGIN: Full titles, minute after minute of titles
    with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
    minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and
    rub, the man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting
    tired. Flirtatious no more, this is getting to be work...The
    unseen woman shakes the hand vigorously, the man says a
    single sound urging her to continue, the exhausted hand
    complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands as
    TITLES CONTINUE.....The new hand, wearing a wedding ring,
    goes to work then it too stops to rest..the man says
    something in Spanish...important for us because it will
    establish that there will be no subtitles and yet we
    understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She
    replies in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty
    laugh, that her hands are tired. We understand. The man tells
    her to continue. She continues, the rub now desultory and
    resentful. She stops for another rest. The man wants more and
    grabs forcibly at her hand -- his own hand coming into view
    for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular
    anger, "you said you would never push me around again. If you
    do, I will somehow break your arm so you can rub your own
    back as high as you want." (NOTE: All Spanish dialogue will
    be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish
    speaking..working in tidbits or extra exposition, jokes etc.)
    For now, the man's tone changes, placating her to continue.
    Even as she resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic
    argument in Spanish. This is no longer a massage we envy.
    This back rub, going as it does from sex and hope to discord
    and alienation, will be our only full direct knowledge of
    their marriage.

2   INT./EXT. BEDROOM / DUSTY ROAD - OTHER ANGLE                  2

    Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school
    bus stopping at the corner on a dusty road.
    We now see the full figure of the woman's back as she looks
    up with excitement and stops rubbing with the word,




                                                             2.







    "Cristina." When the man protests her stopping she indicates
    they should both run and meet their daughter. He waves her
    off. Stunned by his disinterest, she runs from the room.....

3   EXT. DUSTY ROAD - THE BUS                                     3

    As CRISTINA, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to
    step down. She sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly,
    digging into her little pack to pull out an English book
    which she displays with pride. Now she steps down from the
    bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
    voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.

                        NARRATOR

              To Princeton University's Director
              of Admissions: In considering me
              for a scholarship you have asked
              for, and have every reason to
              expect, an essay from me about
              myself. And, as a clever high
              school graduate, I of course
              realize the subtext of this essay
              about who I am and why I want to
              enter Princeton, is actually to
              make clear to you why you should
              have me. I have gotten tips, from
              friends who have preceded me to
              college, that being a Latina, with
              my grades, list of activities and
              relative poverty, I am as good as
              in if I simply do the dance and
              work in a word like
              "bipolarization" every so often.
              And while I love dances -- this
              dance of self is one I am afraid to
              master.
                  (young girl looks off and
                   lights up)
              I prefer to write about my mother.

4   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - SCHOOL GIRL'S POV - MOM                   4

    A drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20's. As mother
    and daughter move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man
    getting out. He nods in another direction calling our
    attention to a police car parked off the street. The woman
    does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
    father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the
    child has..this is one supportive mom..again she is
    disbelieving that her husband shows no interest, especially
    when the child seems briefly hurt. The woman's husband looks
    from the window and sees the ominous man coming. The woman
    now does everything humanly possible to distract the child so
    she does not see what is transpiring.

                        NARRATOR

              For my mother, that afternoon
              eleven years ago was a watershed
              not because of my father's

                        NARRATOR (cont'd)
              imprisonment but because it was my
              first day at school....

5   INT. KITCHEN / HUSBAND'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                5

    This room is directly across from the husband's room. The
    woman looks up to see her husband open the suitcase to show
    the man a huge store of Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches.
    The man gives her husband some money..all the time the woman
    is chattering to distract the girl. Looking off --the woman
    grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count some money. The
    undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises her
    voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles
    her daughter.

                        NARRATOR

              There was never any pretense that
              the gorgeous, vital, clever,
              temperamental animal that was my
              mother ever for a heartbeat
              considered having any life of her
              own. She ignored all her needs and
              was alive only for me. It was
              terrific.
                  (a long beat)
              At the time.

    ON MOM.

    As she watches her daughter chew a cookie. Her daughter
    begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
    glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the
    action in the next room. Her husband makes a break for the
    window. The other man points a gun at the ceiling preparing
    to fire a warning shot. The woman moves ever so quickly to a
    shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while talking to her
    daughter, making much over the kid's new school books. It is
    an impressive charade.

    FULL SHOT - TAKING IN BOTH ROOMS.

    And just as the cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing,
    she upsets the dishes, the resulting noise covering the
    shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she learned
    today..the daughter says she was taught a little English.
    Mother is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband
    toward the front door where other police await. Her daughter
    starts to follow her gaze and she distracts her..brandishing
    the Spanish/English book and asking her to say something.

    Standing proudly, smoothing her skirt.

    CLOSE UP GIRL.





                                                                 4.







    As she clears her throat and says directly into camera.

                           GIRL

                 Hi.
    The girl and woman are enormously excited over this word even
    though, outside, her life's mate is being loaded into the
    back of a police car.(Note: Mexican police DO NOT duck the
    perpetrator's head WHEN LOADING THEM IN THE BACK SEAT..they
    just allow the concussion.) It seems the mother will save her
    child the trauma of her father being carted off; but the
    police turn on their siren and the girl turns to see her
    father as the car pulls away. The child is stricken. A tear
    starts to form in her eye. Her mother acts quickly. We are
    about to see powerful emotion reversed by sheer force of
    will..the mother leans down, gives three quick kisses - power
    pecks - to the girl's cheeks and then an admonition in
    Spanish.

                           MOTHER

                 Una lágrima...sola una sola...Haz
                 la mejor possible.

                           NARRATOR

                 "One tear..only one...so make it a
                 good one." This was my mother's
                 instruction to me.

    ON CHILD.

    Baffled by the edict..

    ON MOTHER.

    Holding up one finger. That's it..one tear..she means it.

    ON CHILD..

    As she complies..one great tear forming and falling..Her
    mother's thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well with more
    tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
    resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little
    head...the eyes clear.

7   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     7

    As the mother, lying in bed with her daughter loses her own
    fight with tears..managing with difficulty to keep her
    convulsive sobs silent since her daughter and she are
    intertwined like pretzels.

    The girl works on her lesson plan..She is a study in beauty.
    Her mother's daughter. Across the small hallway her mother
    greets and deals with friends and family in a:

9    SERIES OF SHOTS                                                  9

     As the girl works..her dress changing as the days change
     while different visitors listen hard to her mother across the
     hall.

                         NARRATOR

               My mother dealt with our
               considerable problems of survival
               by talking..Always she discovered
               her own best thoughts by sifting
               through her own words.
     The mother stops talking in mid-sentence, realizing she has
     just solved something and makes a note.

10   INT. MOTHER'S BEDROOM - THE TWO OF THEM IN BED - NIGHT       10


                         NARRATOR

               Each night my mother promised me a
               wonderful life.. Each night I
               looked for a new expressive way to
               tell my mother how much I loved
               her.
     The child is ardent..clutching at her heart...kissing her
     mother.. Holding her mother's face, talking directly into her
     eyes. The mother, enormously pleased, is nonetheless thrown
     by the extremes of it.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               I just played and did my lessons
               and every time I looked up my
               mother was in the process of saving
               us.

11   INT. / EXT. MONTAGE - VARIOUS SHOTS                          11

     Her mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and
     relatives bringing food, clothing - toys.

                         NARRATOR

               Desperation in her hands was our
               weapon.

     ON MOTHER..

     We see her totally intimidating a priest.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               With this weapon she had her
               marriage annulled - usually
               impossible for the poor - and
               somehow convinced an associate of
               my father's to transport two
               Mexicans North in style.




                                                              6.








12   INT. SMALL AIRPLANE - MAGIC HOUR                             12

     The mother and daughter seating themselves. The mother is
     enormously nervous with the prospect of flight. She sits,
     the daughter ignores an empty seat and goes on her lap,
     mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug.

               How you doing?

                         GIRL

                   (accented English)
               Hi. How are you? I am fine..
                   (she checks her book of
                    English synonyms)
               ..happy, merry, joyful, glad,
               contented, frisky.
     As they taxi.

                         AMERICAN PILOT

                   (to mother)
               Are you her mother, sister..what?
     The mother says, "solo español"---"only Spanish." The
     daughter starts to chatter excitedly about the imminent
     flight. Her mother quiets her firmly in order to pray for
     their safety.. As the plane continues to taxi...We HEAR the
     mother's prayer in Spanish. She then nudges her
     daughter..who, with this gentlest of prods, repeats the same
     prayer.

     The plane crossing the Rio Grande.

                         NARRATOR

               My mother's prayer for us, which
               she made me repeat exactly,
               represented a stunning look into
               our future. "Please God, let only
               the bad things change."

     Use this image if ever you want to strike a coin depicting
     the moment of no return. The child aglow with happy
     anticipation..the adult brave and enormously anxious.

     OTHER ANGLE.

     He glances over..this is not lechery, it is art
     appreciation..an errant but decent man awed by the creature
     he is drawn to..

                            NARRATOR

                  My mother had redefined her own
                  passions. Blaming herself for the
                  father she gave me, she would never
                  again be lured by a man's rough
                  edges..She had decided that
                  goodness would be her catnip.

     ON MOTHER..

     As she feels him looking at her and turns. With some
     affection and regret, she shakes her head, "no."

     THE PILOT.

     As he mouths the word "ouch."

15   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT...                                        15

     Plane landing on a dirt and grass strip...

16   EXT. FIELD - LATER - NIGHT - ON MOTHER AND DAUGHTER..        16

     Standing on the tarmac..Latin flavored music suddenly gives
     way to a Texas country harmonica riff..The child tries to
     comfort her apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact
     she finds so thrilling.

                      (exulting)
                  Texas...
     The mother hurries her along in the direction of distant
     lights.

                            GIRL (CONT'D)

                      (more emphatically)

                  Mamá, Texas..
     She raises her fingers like pistols. Shoots, blows in them
     and reholsters them.

19   EXT. NORTH VALLEY STREET - EARLY EVENING                     19

     As they disembark...the mother studying a slip of
     paper...fearing she has made the mistake of a lifetime. The
     child fascinated by all.

                          NARRATOR

                At the time, I was oblivious to my
                mother's anguish. She loved and
                lived to talk. Now, as if by a
                witch's spell, words were no longer
                her bridge but her barrier. In a
                very real sense she feared she had
                left herself behind.

     ON THE TWO FEMALES.

     The mother sees something. Joy returns.

     HER POV.

     A street full of stores with SIGNS IN SPANISH..She begins
     walking the street asking passers-by for directions in
     Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with
     relief. So far so very, very good.

20   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - DAY - FIVE MONTHS LATER..                20

     An iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second
     floor horseshoe of apartments.

                          NARRATOR

                We moved into a place managed by my
                mother's aunt. My mother worked two
                jobs in two local stores paying a
                total of 450 dollars a week...

21   INT. APT. - DAY                                              21

     As the mother enters.

                ..just ever so barely enough.

22   INT. APT. - KITCHEN - CLOSER SHOT..                          22

     Cristina taking a newspaper from her book bag and seriously
     pondering - then circling grocery coupons.

     ANGLE ON KITCHEN AREA.

     Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the
     note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese
     on a tortilla.

                         NARRATOR (CONT'D)

               But we were fine. We had it down.
               If only I could have stayed six.
     The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to:

23   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - ELEVATED SHOT - SIX YEARS LATER.       23

     The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a
     wedding reception is in progress -

     EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE.

     Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep,
     explosive smile.
     BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now
     nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some
     other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of
     a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality
     sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him
     saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to
     you. I need oxygen when I look at you." She indicates the six
     children she is dancing with and offers to include him in
     some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of
     just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock
     away..

     OTHER ANGLE..

     A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at
     first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing
     her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the
     rest of the children for a dance..

     MOVING WITH THE BOY..

     As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is
     interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he
     asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts.

     ON CRISTINA..

     Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first
     time held by a male, the first time held close, the first
     sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male
     eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his
     hips into his dancing partner.

     ON HER MOTHER.

     Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about
     to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is
     scare the car.




                                                              10.







     She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming
     his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts
     him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the
     head maternally and goes back to Cristina.

     CRISTINA.

     Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene.

                           NARRATOR

                 That quickly it was clear she could
                 no longer work two jobs and leave
                 me to my own at night. The
                 following morning she did something
                 about it. A boy I never saw again
                 had changed our lives.

24   INT. BUS - DAY                                               24

     The mother and her aunt, MONICA, take their seats..the bus is
     filled with domestics..the mother, nervous, looks over to see
     and greet... THE BRIDE from last night's wedding.

26   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY                                      26

     MUSIC CHANGE..as they disembark and start walking, joining
     the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the
     hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. Grand
     trees from either side meet each other high over the road.

     ON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK

     She sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is
     not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin
     version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in
     the background, one black SUV after another has a mother
     taking kids home from school.

27   EXT. ATTRACTIVE HOME SECURITY GATE - DAY                     27

     Monica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open.

     In the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt...and huge
     rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A catering truck stands
     in the driveway.

29   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - GREAT KITCHEN / POOL - DAY               29

     They enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn,

THEIR POV.

DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits
dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life.
She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is
a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she
doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find.
She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't
hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific"
variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is
drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her
grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more
rolls of sod wait to be laid.

THE TWO LATINAS.

As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next.
Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the
pool..as they start out..

THEIR EXIT.

Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open
after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react.
Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to
join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of
it..too late in the day for sudden movements.

KITCHEN DOORWAY.


                       BERNICE

             Gee whiz in heaven...How are you?

                 (a bit hyper)
             Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was
             looking for decoration to put on
             the glass so people would stop
             walking into it and instead of
             taking what they had in stock,
             which was awful, I special ordered.

Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose,
gestures that Monica needs help not conversation.

                       DEBORAH (CONT'D)

             ..and what difference does that
             make when your nose is bleeding.
             Shut up, Deborah.

                       BERNICE

             Now you got it, Mom.




                                                             12.







     Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the
     freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the
     kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to
     feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can
     experience.

                         DEBORAH

               Here, take these.
                   (second thought)
               Was that strange to give you
               money..I just felt badly that..

                            MONICA

               It's okay.
     She pockets the cash.

30   EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                                  30

     Moments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table.
     Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking
     hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test
     which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then
     some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under
     her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard
     becoming more beautiful even as we look.

                         MONICA

               She is my niece. She and her
               daughter live in the apartment I
               manage. Yolanda, who worked for
               you, lived there before she went
               back home. That's how I heard about
               the job.

                         DEBORAH

               So who am I interviewing?

                            MONICA

               Her.

                         DEBORAH

                   (forcefully)
               You're gorgeous.
     On our gal..as she, not understanding the word, smiles and
     nods.

                         MONICA

                   (translating sotto)
               Vistosos.
     Our gal thrown. Not knowing how now to react.

                         EVELYN

               She doesn't mean it as a
               compliment. It's more of an
               accusation.




                                                        13.








                    DEBORAH

          This is my daughter Bernice and
          this is my mother, Evelyn Norwich..

                     BERNICE

              (rising)
          Excuse me...Glad you're okay.
              (then to other Latina)
          Good luck.
Our gal smiles back in appreciation.

                    DEBORAH

          No, stay..this involves you.

                    BERNICE

          I wouldn't want some kid around for
          my interview. You understand, Mom.

                    EVELYN

              (to Bernice)
          Strength of character..empathy..big
          heart..taste for futility - God I
          love you.
She eyes with disapproval her mother's empty glass.

                     DEBORAH


          MOTHER!

               (then to Bernice)
          Stop. It's just a conversation -
          not an interview. Please sit.
               (to visitors)
          Don't you want to get out of the
          sun?
She indicates a shaded seat. Deborah is protected by hat,
umbrella, sun glasses while her guest sits bareheaded
enjoying the rays and indicates she is fine. Underneath
Deborah's surface is a Russian roulette of deeply felt
emotions..at this moment she is earnest and vulnerable.

                    DEBORAH (TO OUR GAL) (CONT'D)

          You guys want some lemonade?
              (they demur)
          Let's just talk. I have two
          children. My husband works
          nights..he's a chef and has his own
          place.

                    MONICA

          Do you work?

                    DEBORAH

          I helped run a commercial design
          company until ten months ago when




                                                        14.








                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          it was downsized to zip. Okay. I
          have two children. I like the house
          to be like me in that I'm very
          loose and meticulous at the same
          time. It's all about first names
          and closeness here but I care about
          the place, you know. It's what they
          used to call homemaker..
The two visitors exchange a wide-eyed look. Which Deborah
sees and understands.

                     DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (to Monica)
          I'm not leaving time for you to
          translate.
Monica says, in Spanish, "this woman is very strange. The
only thing I understand is she has two kids." Deborah leans
into Monica. Face to face, tender but unblinking..

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Too bad for you that it just never
          occurred to you to check on how
          much Spanish I know.

                    MONICA

              (a solid beat of
               humiliation then)
          I'm sorry what I say about
          you...don't hold it against her.

                    BERNICE

          Mom!!

                    DEBORAH

          I don't speak any Spanish. But I'm
          not an idiot - I talk for an hour
          and you say two words. What did you
          say?
Monica squirms - unusual for her.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Never mind. You got your nose
          bopped. I got my feelings hurt.
          Onward.
As Monica paraphrases what has happened, her translation is
DIALED DOWN for the:

                    NARRATOR

              (as Deborah continues
               talking)
          I will major in linguistics and
          make sociology my sub-
          concentration. Because it has been
          my experience that the barriers of

          language are more than we dare
          admit. That, as much as we
          translate, finally we will never
          understand each other. My mother's
          name, for example, beautiful in
          Spanish, becomes leaden and awful
          when pronounced by a non-Latin.

                    DEBORAH (IN THE CLEAR)

          What's your name? Llamo? One of my
          five Spanish words..

                    OUR GAL

          Flor Moreno.
She pronounces Flor in the Latin way...lots of RRRR's with a
curling of the tongue sound at the end.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.
She pronounces it flat like the "floor" we walk
on...throughout the following each of the women sticks to
their pronunciation as indicated by the extra "r's.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (correcting)
          Florrrrr.

                      DEBORAH

          Flor.

                    FLOR

              (trying)
          Florrrrr.

                    DEBORAH

          Flor..what I walk on?

                      MONICA AND EVELYN

          Florrrrr.




                                                        16.








                      FLOR

          Florrrrr.

                    BERNICE

          It means flower, right?

                    MONICA

          Yes. Flower. Florrrrr.

                      EVELYN

          Florrrrr.

                      FLOR

          Florrrrr.
Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a
beat..eyes everyone with some hostility.

                    DEBORAH

              (directly to Flor)
          Is there some school of the ear I'm
          flunking out of right now?
Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name.
Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming
clearly and strangely pissed..

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          What did she say?

CLOSE ON FLOR...

She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own
irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves
forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance.
She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the
first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to
Deborah.

                    MONICA

              (translating)
          She says..If you curl your tongue
          and let it be loose you will have
          it..that it's hard for Americans..
          She says it's great that you try so
          hard. Many people wouldn't bother.

                    DEBORAH

              (an emotional
               pronouncement/her
               greatest accolade)
          She gets me....
She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile.




                                                         17.








                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          You want some lemonade? Take some
          lemonade.
She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes
and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort:

                      DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Florrrrr.
It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her
hands together.

                    FLOR

              (a Spanish word)
          Sublime.
Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark
corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier,
innocent..Wholly and completely attractive.

                    DEBORAH

          Whew, dense but stubborn, right?
          Thanks.
              (an important declaration)
          What you just did with me is just
          what kids need..patience and
          encouragement. Alright, money...
Bernice rises like a shot to take off..

                    BERNICE

          Goodbye, really..
              (to Flor)
          Look forward to seeing you.
As she leaves.

                    DEBORAH

              (absently to Bernie)
          Love you...
              (then with not a
               monoseconds break)
          ... the job is six days a week,
          seven to seven..the kids and all
          housekeeping, how much a week would
          you like?
Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness,
ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say.."

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          No.. This is an important
          question..if you ask for too little
          it means you don't value




                                                                18.










                  yourself..too much and you're
                  taking advantage.
                      (after Monica translates)
                  So?
     Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not
     without some native wit and style to maneuver around it.

                            FLOR

                      (extremely heavy accent)
                  One thousand dollars.
     Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah
     now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her
     face and shaking her head.

     OTHER ANGLE..

     As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh,
     flash four fingers to Flor..

     ON EVELYN.

     Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they
     should go for six.

                            MONICA

                      (firmly)
                  Six hundred dollars.
     Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat.

                            DEBORAH

                  Welcome to the family..
     Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of
     Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the
     first of many borders to be violated.

31   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     31

     As Flor and Monica exit and can finally show their full joy.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:


32   EXT. STONE CANYON - EVENING.                                 32

     JOHN CLASKY driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat,
     talented, successful man with an ego as balanced as a high-
     end watch; who loves his wife, kids and job. In other words,
     watch out, John.

33   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 33

     As John pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and
     exits his SUV carrying a large wrapped tray..




                                                             19.








34   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 34

     As John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the
     tray on a counter where food servers are working.

                         JOHN

               I brought some dessert.
     As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap
     and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may
     notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and
     whispers to him.

                         CATERER

               She came down to check on the party
               and realized the gardeners hadn't
               finished rolling the sod.

35   INT. / EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                  35


     JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS.

     Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the
     last huge cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully
     manicured backyard. It is hard manual labor involving
     physical strength. The female caterers are complaining that
     it's too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.

                         DEBORAH

                   (to catering women)
               We can do it. Come on.
     She falls over the roll..getting filthy..but it gives and
     they gain momentum...one of the catering women falling down,
     one losing pace.. Deborah,however, gains the upper hand. Yet,
     even while succeeding, she remonstrates herself.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (great exertion)
               Why... do... I... care.. so..
               much.. about.... CRAP?
     And now she wins.. the cylinder of grass rolls all the way
     out and she jumps on the seam in victory. She is dirty,
     spent and triumphant..the components for a solid sexual
     experience..and, in truth, as the exhausted caterers half-
     heartedly applaud the bizarre victory, she has gotten off.
     She looks with mother's pride at the lawn. Then sees John.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Can you believe they left without
               finishing?
     As she looks at her handiwork - John looks at her..A
     grin..half laugh.. He loves the dame.




                                                       20.








                    DEBORAH (BREATHLESS) (CONT'D)

          Looks great, huh?.... You're not
          looking.

                    JOHN

          I was getting a kick looking at you
          look at it.
Not the answer she wanted..

                    DEBORAH

          I better get dressed again in case
          anybody's just a half hour late.
She hits a switch at the door and the backyard area is now
fully illuminated -- set up for a dinner party for 20 or
so....all details thought about and done to a "T". This is
the outdoor lighting nobody nails..the twinkling of a half
acre..the path to the pool like a runway to heaven. As she
looks at it all she has a wistful moment.

                     DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (a replenishing sigh)
          Okay..We're okay here.
              (then)
          Why can't everything be like sod?
          There's no wait, no dung, nothing
          you have to do right and yet it's
          perfect. It covers up all your
          dirt and makes things immediately
          pretty..then, the miracle, if you
          just give it time, it roots and you
          can't tell it from the real thing.
              (a look to her husband)
          No reaction. Nothing to say.

                    JOHN

          Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I
          don't have anything particular to
          say.

                    DEBORAH

          Oh, John why don't you just take
          out a knife and kill me all
          together.
Somewhat crushed, she prepares to exit.

                    JOHN

          How'd you get there..Hey, wait a
          minute..Deb..stop..come on.
              (she turns)
          I'd like to figure this one out.
          What would have been the great
          thing for me to say after you said
          the sod sentence?..Really.




                                                             21.








                         DEBORAH

               That's actually a good question.

                         JOHN

               There you go. I surprise sometimes.

                         DEBORAH

               I would have liked, if after I
               compared the sod to life, if you
               had said, "Exactly!"
     She turns to leave.

                         JOHN

               Yeah. But to say that and mean it
               I'd have to think the same way you
               do.

                          DEBORAH

                    (some sense of mischief)
               It's worth a try...I had something
               else to tell you...it'll come to
               me..

36   INT. OLIVE GARDEN TYPE RESTAURANT - NIGHT                 36

     Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant,
     Cristina, totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess
     with a pronounced and charming accent as her mother, standing
     beside her, bounces with energy and joy.

                         CRISTINA

               Could we have a table for two,
               please?
     Flor says something to her in Spanish..the daughter waves it
     off and when the mother persists, she translates.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               We're celebrating.

                         HOSTESS

               Smoking or non-smoking?
     Before her daughter can translate.

                           FLOR

               Dancing!
     The hostess laughs..They are seated at the two ends of a
     banquette and each automatically picks up her place setting
     and "scootches" closely together. Cristina picks up a menu
     and points to the prices.

                         CRISTINA

               Wow, expensive..




                                                             22.







     Flor scoffs -- says she's making six hundred dollars a
     week..then looks at the prices and does a take. The hostess
     returns --- Cristina points to the menu.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               This is just for the starter?
     Flor, encouraging her daughter's spirit of adventure, places
     her hand over the prices in the menu.

                         HOSTESS

               Uh-huh..And those men would like to
               buy you a drink.
     The daughter translates...the hostess points out the early
     30's, well dressed, quite nice looking businessmen. Flor
     addresses the men who are several tables away. Cristina
     moves uncomfortably but responds to her mother's nudge to
     translate.

                         CRISTINA

                   (to men)
               This is very embarrassing but--
               "what's wrong with you? I'm with
               my daughter for God's sake!"
     Then hostess, Flor and finally Cristina laugh. Cristina
     relishes getting back to ordering from the menu...in a moment
     that is a bit noteworthy..

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               And I would like to begin with the
               Jumbo Shrimp.

37   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY - 6:30 A.M.                          37

     Flor smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus
     from the bus stop to work..one of a straggly line of
     domestics. Deborah jogs into view.

                         DEBORAH

               Hi, Flor..See you up there.
     Deborah runs past..She is clearly upset..She is also more
     than a stay-in-shape jogger. She is an athletic woman fueled
     by an ever flickering pilot light of anxiety. This makes her
     seriously quick. She is highly aware of passing
     everybody..She needs to pass everybody..Her voice trails
     behind her as she announces to all as she approaches.."left,
     please," "left," "left."

38   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - DAY                           38

     John enters his son's room..GEORGIE, age 9.




                                                             23.








                         JOHN

               Okay...think SERIOUSLY about
               getting up. You don't have to get
               up yet but are you thinking
               seriously about it?

                         GEORGIE

               Yes.

                         JOHN

               Okay.

39   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.                           39

     Bernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with
     the filling and the last cooking process. Some great idea
     which will have us making a mental note to try it at home.

40   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS DAY - DAY                       40

     John opens Georgie's door again.

                         GEORGIE

               Now?

                         JOHN

               Yes..actual up..
     Georgie gets up..

                         GEORGIE

               Morning, Dad.

                         JOHN

               Yeah, good morning.

                         GEORGIE

               You as mad at me as Mom 'cause of
               what happened?
     John pauses..aware his answer will have repercussions but
     integrity wins.

                         JOHN

               No, Georgie, I'm not.

                         GEORGIE

               Are you mad at me?

                         JOHN

               Uh...okay, no..

41   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN DOORWAY - DAY                    41

     As Flor enters from outside.

                         BERNICE

               Morning, good to see you.




                                                        24.








                       FLOR

             Morning. Good too.
She notices the French Toast.

                          BERNICE

             Try some.
She demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula,
indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she
does...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open
at this kid's ability to make something mundane
special..Bernice laughs.

                          BERNICE (CONT'D)

             Thanks.
Her mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful,
tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her
current demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head,
making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to
Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.

                          DEBORAH

             Tough day.
Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a
GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with
a ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen...
what's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the
self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice.

                       BERNICE

             I had an idea for a breakthrough in
             French toast so I made breakfast. I
             don't want to be teased about it..
             No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try
             it and if by any chance you have a
             positive reaction...

                       DEBORAH

             Right..mean ol' me. I can't play
             right now. I have to do something
             about your brother.

                       BERNICE

             I had an idea for a recipe. When
             has that happened? I got up early
             to do this. At least taste it, for
             God's sakes!
She does..

                       DEBORAH

             Oh, it's good...oh God, it's rich --
             Oh God, it's good.




                                                              25.








                         DEBORAH

                   (sudden alarm)
               By the way, you could do without
               this.
     The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at
     her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her
     daughter because her attention has been diverted so that
     Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager,
     distraught, moves from the room.

                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)

               NO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch.
     Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to
     accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout
     stopped her in mid-sentence.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I mean it, NEVER!
     ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I'm not mad. I'm thinking of you.
               This is me being nice..
     Then using her hands to demonstrate.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Just no taking ball from dog.
                   (broadly)
               Trust me on that one.
     CLOSE UP ON Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in
     front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               You and me. We are fine. Just a
               tip.
                    (she gives her waist a
                     little squeeze)
               Girlfriends.
                    (Flor is totally confused)
               Could you make some coffee? Cafe?

                         FLOR

               Yes.
     Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino
     machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised.

42   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY        42

     Deb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos,
     conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a
     sponge..such fluffy towels.




                                                             26.







     Skylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth. There
     is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of
     this being that these people have a fireplace in their
     bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a
     contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye
     and one brown.

                         JOHN

               This isn't an argument, honey.

                         DEBORAH

               Yes. Yes it is. So stop being so
               maniacally calm.

                          JOHN

                   (emphatically)
               No..it's not. Because I understand
               your side.

                         DEBORAH

               I can't be wrong about that too.
               This is a fight. We're having a
               fight. Yo, I feel anger.
     Deborah turns from the sink revealing one brown eye and one
     blue. She blinks, realizes one lens is not in and turns back
     to the sink.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Can I have a moment?
     John exits into the..

43   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  43

     As John awaits his wife...a beat and she enters with two blue
     eyes. Even though she is attempting reason and self-control
     her voice is filled with tension and goes from loud to
     borderline yelling.

                         DEBORAH

               Okay..Let's get someplace here.

44   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                         44

     As Flor works methodically - orienting herself..she is able
     to hear their totally foreign words and though their volume
     registers on her a bit - basically she remains blithe.
     Loading a dishwasher, memorizing where everything is..

45   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                  45


     BACK TO SCENE:


                         DEBORAH

               You, mister, are crazy making..I
               can't take this calm thing you've




                                                        27.








                    DEBORAH

          started doing. It's like this is
          your way of letting me know there's
          something deeply wrong with me
          because I'm not calm.

                    JOHN

              (calmly)
          Let's not go all over the
          place..Can't we...

                    DEBORAH

              (shouted burst)
          If you're going to talk to me
          please have the decency to raise
          your voice.

                     JOHN

              (a beat then sudden
               urgency and change of
               tone)
          Let's make a break for it.

                    DEBORAH

          What are you talking about?
He signals her with his eyes and head and then takes a large
but tentative step away from the spot where he was
standing...then additional faster steps. He gestures with
enormous energy for her to follow him to his new spot in the
room. She eyes him suspiciously.

                    JOHN

          Just for a second.
She walks to him...he puts an arm around her shoulder. And
gestures back to where they were standing. He talks in an
almost hushed, conspiratorial voice.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          We don't have to be those people.
          Nobody's watching. They've been
          masquerading as us for a while
          here..I'll distract them - you make
          a break for it and I'll meet you
          outside.

                    DEBORAH

          You're ridiculing me because I care
          about this.

                    JOHN

              (firmly)
          No. I'm not. I mean this..let's get
          away from those two in case they're
          as miserable as they look..




                                                           28.








                    JOHN

              (urging..like a Southern
               coach)
          Come on, baby.
He is looking at her with wit and conviction..trying to
squirt lighter fluid at the flame of their love. Deborah
looks up at him..intimacy of a different sort.

                    DEBORAH

          Let me ask you a question..let me
          change the subject..Forget for a
          moment that you won't support me
          with Georgie..

                    JOHN

              (reasonably)
          Well, I don't think...
She makes a noise of frustration to stop him..It   works. John
is rendered still and intimidated by her conduct   but he is
"man" enough for his jaw to set...to pause for a   beat as he
looks her straight in the eye..And walks back to   the spot
they occupied previously.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

          Go ahead.

                    DEBORAH

          Here's the question. It's been on
          my mind more and more. Do you do
          that calm thing for the purpose of
          infuriating me?

                    JOHN

              (genuinely puzzled)
          What? Why would ...
              (on her exasperated look)
          Why would anyone do something to
          someone they love for the purpose
          of messing them up?

                    DEBORAH

              (unconvinced/distant)
          Okay.
He hates that look of isolation on her face..He needs to make
her feel better.

                    JOHN

          Deb, since high school we've been
          able to read each other...take
          advantage of it..The answer to the
          question is,"absolutely not." Now
          take a look and tell me if you
          believe me.




                                                              29.







     She looks at him..with a finger motion he directs her gaze to
     his eyes..
     CLOSE on JOHN'S EYES.
     Open, smiling, trusting. Trying to get a laugh out of her.

     CLOSE ON DEBORAH'S EYES.

     Studying, questioning, probing, doubting, exhausted...

                         DEBORAH

               I don't.. believe you. I think you
               just want me to feel badly about
               myself..Sorry, honey.

46   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            46

     John enters - not seeing Flor - goes to the Sparkletts water
     container and fills a cup...He is shaken..

                         JOHN

                   (to himself)
               Great God in heaven save me.
     Boy meets girl.

                         FLOR

               Hi.
     He turns with a start to see Flor smiling at him. Gorgeous
     squared. His first word is inadvertent.

                         JOHN

               Whoa...whoa...I didn't know Deborah
               had found someone... You work here?
               You're going to help with the house
               and kids?

                         FLOR

               Solo español.

                         JOHN

               You work here and you don't speak
               any English at all?
     The sound of feet on the stairs..Deborah and Georgie enter.

                          DEBORAH

               All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and
               press two for Spanish.
                   (even before she enters)
               Flor...John.
                   (to John enunciating the
                    name)
               This is Flor.




                                                             30.








                         JOHN

                   (pronouncing it perfectly)
               Hi, Flor.
     Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (to Deborah)
               Look, I'll take Georgie to school.

                         DEBORAH

               No. I'm doing it..show Flor the
               ropes.
     Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then
     Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and
     come with her.

47   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           47

     The biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle
     custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite
     fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and
     shares a woman to woman moment with Flor.

                         DEBORAH

               Fuckin' hombres, huh?
     She sniffles. Flor nods uncertainly. A small voice from the
     back seat..Georgie..

                         GEORGIE

               I just didn't want to sing last
               night.

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                   (hurt)
               Yeah. Well you said you would..You
               said you wanted to. I asked you
               five times. Then when I have the
               whole party paying attention you
               refused.
     As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well.
     But he's just two lines into an old blues standard:

                         DEBORAH

               It doesn't do any good now,
               Georgie.
     She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes
     up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid-
     song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a
     divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for
     her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a
     Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting."




                                                             31.








                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I've programmed it for Spanish..
               Look, it will take you anywhere and
               then back home. If you figured out
               how to make coffee on that thing
               it's all downhill.
     The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns. Flor
     is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is
     singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by
     the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her
     life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses
     anything.

                         DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D)

               This is stop gap..You, kiddo,
               you're going to have to learn
               English.

48   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                  48

     John cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they
     are seen doing what they do best applies here.. In the
     BACKGROUND John's number two, PETER, the Sous Chef, being
     bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and GWEN, who
     spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection
     for John. At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of
     art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but
     he keeps dropping items.....each time a Latin kitchen worker,
     ALEX, 20, dives on the spillage..At one point they bump.

                          JOHN

               Sorry...

                         PETER

                   (sharply to Alex)
               Not the best place to stand, fella.

                         JOHN

                   (to Alex)
               No. It's me. You're the new
               helper, huh..

                         ALEX

               I didn't mean to...

                         JOHN

               No..no..it's okay. It's me being
               bugged.
     Two people head for John almost simultaneously. PEG, an arty
     looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair,
     enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'.

                         PEG

               You are going to be so happy..
     The Maitre D' enters.




                                                        32.








                    MAITRE D'

          I have something very important to
          tell you.
John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman
who promised happiness. She hefts her ice chest up on the
counter.

                    PEG

          Perfect cod this is John -- John,
          perfect cod..Best one I've seen all
          season and he was swimming twenty
          minutes ago.
The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a
writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. You get it..

                    JOHN

          Knockout.
              (to Alex)
          You want to learn something? You
          want to pack it away?
The kid nods.. he picks up the fish.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Cradle it...Put it in the cooler
          but not on its side.. In the same
          position it swims.
              (important added thought)
          And check the ice pack..make sure
          it can drain away..if it can't the
          chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all
          that and nobody can put a fish in
          the fridge better than you...and
          that's a solid start.. First day
          and you already did something
          perfect.

                    KID

              (smiling)
          Yes, I understand.

                    MAITRE D'

          Please. Now?

                    JOHN

          Oh, sorry..I forgot.
He whispers in John's ear..

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Damn.. "ohhhh damn."

                    PETER

          What, buddy, what?




                                                        33.








                     JOHN

           Victor spotted a food critic..

                     PETER

           From?

                     VICTOR

           The New York Times..I'll bet they
           sent her out just for us.
               (hands John a slip)
           Here's what she ordered.

                     PETER

           Look, if you're nervous take a
           walk..

                     JOHN

           I don't need a walk.

                     GWEN

           I'll walk with you..I know a
           breathing thing.

                      JOHN

           What do you think I'm worried
           about... how I'll cook? That's not
           the problem..
               (looks at slip/then to
                Alex)
           The lady wants fish. Get the fish.
He starts to prepare for cooking.

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

           I worked in a kitchen once in New
           York that got four stars. It was
           like a line formed for the chance
           to become an asshole. People's
           accents changed. The heart went out
           of the place. You understand.

                     PETER

           No.

                      GWEN

               (w/barely understated
                passion)
           I agree with everything you've
           said. I admire you for your
           feelings. I hope to adopt them as
           my own....

ON JOHN.

As he works..Let's be clear here...this is that sequence that
either kicks out or doesn't..no food channel..no simple knife
stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous...smart and
gifted as he prepares the critic's meal.




                                                             34.







     He is talking quickly..almost to himself.

                         JOHN

               I don't know what to root for.. the
               thought of one star makes me
               nauseous..but with four there's no
               place to go but, "Oh my God, they
               took away a star."
                   (musing)
               Three..three and a half. That's
               what you want..No. Wrong! Three and
               a half you feel disappointed that
               you just missed out on four. You
               know what you want? Three and a
               quarter..
                   (a eureka moment)
               That would be perfect!!
                   (getting off on it)
               It would mean you're good..but
               you're not good enough to feel
               disappointed that you just missed
               out on excellent..but nothing truly
               bad happened, you still got your
               three and a quarter stars. Which
               encourages you to try and
               improve..And you still get enough
               respect so that you can get good
               people to work with you..Business
               is good but not crazy. You're right
               there underneath the radar where
               you get to mind your own business.
               That's a solid life.
     He tastes a sliver of the food dish he is preparing.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (with professional honesty
                    and some regret)
               Aw, man..this is amazing. No three
               and a quarter here.

49   INT. CLASKY KITCHEN - DAY.                                49

     Evelyn, having a glass of white wine and a sandwich, is
     talking to Bernice in the kitchen also including Flor though
     she is only catching a word here or there..

                         EVELYN

               Well, I'm in the vitamin section
               and this little hip hop
               girl..what's her name..Grammys -
               adorable -- big voice..subtle
               phrasing...oh, she's famous..the
               kids know her...oh - little blue
               shoes..darn me.
     Flor looks concerned over Evelyn's displeasure with herself,
     a fact picked up by the older woman...It is actually a small




                                                        35.







but resonant good-natured, affectionate moment between the
lush and the Latina.

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)

          God Bless the language barrier, it
          keeps you from being bored with me.
Spoken to directly like this, Flor is confused..

                    EVELYN (CONT'D)

          Anyway, she said, "aren't you
          Evelyn Wright?" First of all, that
          she recognized me from the old
          covers and then she .... Oh, please
          her name..it makes the story so
          much better...She said,
              (genuinely stirred)
          "Whenever I think everything is.."
              (aside)
          Pardon my French..pardon her French
              (back to quote)
          "a mother hmmmhmmm...I put on one
          of your records.."

                    BERNICE

          Awwww. How sweet....
Evelyn looks transparently vulnerable for a second. Flor
reacts. Bernie squeezes her grandmother's hand..Flor smiles.

                    EVELYN

          Just such a lovely thing to come
          from the blue....
Deborah enters, carrying a load of packages. With lightning
speed, her eye picks out...the glass her mother is drinking
from.

                    DEBORAH

          Oh, Mother...It's not even noon.

                    EVELYN

              (defensively)
          It's almost two o'clock.

                    DEBORAH

          God, where is this day going...Flor
          could you come with me?

                    BERNICE

          Grandma, tell Mom what happened.

                      EVELYN

                (very deliberately)
          No.




                                                             36.







     Deborah leads the way out...but Flor stops before following
     her out to give Evelyn a gesture of support and appreciation.

50   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                          50

     John is in Bernie's room - helping her with her homework.
     They lay at right angles to each other..He is testing her.

                         JOHN

               This is going to work.

                         BERNICE

               I don't know anything.

                         JOHN

               Free your mind...the president
               whose policies many consider
               responsible for the Great
               Depression...

                         BERNICE

               I don't know...

                         JOHN

               Name a vacuum cleaner..

                         BERNICE

               Okay. Yes..thanks.

                         JOHN

               And this vacuum whooshed all this
               money out of everyone's pockets.

                         BERNICE

               Got it. I no longer know nothing.

                         JOHN

               And Hoover was followed in office
               by..

                         BERNICE

               I'm just drawing blanks. I'm
               embarrassed. It's my own fault I
               spent my time on math, which I'm
               lucky if I don't flunk anyway and..

                         JOHN

               The guy we are looking for is not a
               ruse..

                         BERNICE

               What's ruse mean?

                         JOHN

               Phony. So this president was not a
               ruse..He was the real thing.




                                                             37.








                         JOHN

                   (she looks at him blankly)
               Ruse??

                         BERNICE

                   (enjoying her father's
                    absurdity)
               Rusevelt..If I'd ever heard of the
               word before - that would lock it
               in..It's so stupid it might work
               anyway...
     Deborah enters followed by Flor. They are carrying several
     boxes of clothes...

                         DEBORAH

               Surprise new clothes..
     Bernie gasps..As she looks at a sweater..

                         BERNICE

               What'd I do right?

                         DEBORAH

               Warehouse sale..
     Bernice tries on the sweater over her T-shirt..and mirth
     ends..The sweater is tight...Bernice picks up a blouse and
     then skirt and checks the size.

     ON FLOR AND JOHN.

     As they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA ANGLE as each catches on
     and is dumbfounded.

     ON BERNICE..

     Whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to
     deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though mightily stung:

                         BERNICE

               Thanks, mom..I'm glad you didn't
               get here a little earlier or else I
               wouldn't be able to tell you that
               your gift is a ruse. Please, excuse
               me..
     She exits to her bathroom.

51   INT. STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING                               51

     Flor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly
     down the stairs...John pissed..Deborah feeling the futility
     of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it.




                                                              38.








                         DEBORAH

               She's right between the two
               sizes..I thought about it..what am
               I supposed to do encourage
               her...what is it? - DENIAL? Or
               motivate her to get herself in
               shape.
     Flor tries to slide by..Something surreptitious in her
     behavior..Deborah suddenly turns to Flor.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Flor..
     She holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture.
     Flor does not waver..just meets her eyes.

                         FLOR

               Me puedo ir?..go..can go?

                         DEBORAH

                   (a bit nonplussed)
               Sure. Go.

                         JOHN

               I'll drive you to the bus stop.
     And that fast they are gone.

52   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           52

     As John gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door
     and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes.

                         JOHN

               Sorry. I'm cracking.
     As he moves back to his side of the vehicle.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

                   (a shout)
               Shiiiiiiit!
     Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement.

53   INT. JOHN'S CAR - EARLY EVENING..                            53

     As they drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even
     if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself
     anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us.

                         JOHN (CONT'D)

               I am running out of excuses for the
               lady of the house.
     Flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. But
     then John takes rein of his emotions.




                                                        39.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          But you know, you gotta watch out
          for the times you think you're
          absolutely right..But, man, Bernice
          has finals tomorrow. She didn't
          need this one..And just that look
          on her face when she got the gifts--
              (now his voice cracks; he
               grows wet-eyed)
          --like for a second she thought all
          her problems with her mother had
          been solved...
Flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually
crying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there
is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the
macho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces
front quickly.

                    NARRATOR

          My mother did not understand her
          male boss. His heart was good and
          he was rare in not flirting with
          her. But they were starkly
          different. Privacy and dignity were
          the same word to my mother.
          Naturally, when she found herself
          sitting next to a man who cried
          over his child's hurt she had no
          idea how to process the event.
Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the
canyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt.

                     FLOR

          Gracias.
She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is
still rolling a bit...

                    JOHN

          What are you doing? Let me take you
          all the way.
Reluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet
to her bus stop and she gets out again.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          How weird was this ride? Sorry.

                    FLOR

          No es nada.
He doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a
little helpless gesture..




                                                               40.








54   EXT. BUS STOP - EARLY EVENING..                             54

     As Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward.

                         NARRATOR

               The job was taxing her. She had no
               template for confusion let alone
               frustration.
     While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few
     yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her
     colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them
     adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor
     unsuccessfully try to shake off her day.

55   INT. FLOR'S APT. - EVENING                                  55

     As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and
     distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and
     takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a
     huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled
     daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the
     daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure.

                         NARRATOR

               It was so unusual for my mother to
               ask my help that I realized
               immediately she was losing her
               battle to be uninvolved with the
               Claskys.
     Flor asks her daughter how to say something in English.

                            CRISTINA

               Try it on.
     Flor asks again in Spanish...trying to find a precise
     phrase.. The nuance important to her.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               Please try it on?
     Flor knows the word "please"..it's not what she wants...what
     she wants is a way to say, "try it on" in a manner which is
     not a request..or order, but is, rather, friendly and caring.
     Her daughter works on the problem.

                         CRISTINA (CONT'D)

               Just try it on?

                         FLOR

                   (thickly accented)
               Just try it on.

                         CRISTINA

                   (small accent)
               Just try it on.




                                                             41.








                         FLOR

                   (improvement each time)
               Just try it on...just try it on..
     She's got it.

                         NARRATOR

               Our culture embraces fullness in a
               woman. You, the women of the
               admissions committee, as
               intelligent as you are, have no
               idea how casual and complete such
               acceptance is back home, in the
               land of the size 16 bikini.

56   EXT. BUS STOP - NORTH VALLEY - PRE-DAWN                   56

     Flor is the only one waiting. An empty bus stops and she gets
     on.

57   EXT. STREET - NEAR BUS STOP - HIGH SHOT - FIRST LIGHT     57

     As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd., overtake and pass two
     UCLA men running at a good clip as Flor's bus stops.

     CLOSE ON FLOR..

     As she strides purposefully up the street.

                         NARRATOR

               This is one of the cultural
               differences between us which I wish
               to explore academically at
               Princeton. American women, I
               believe, actually feel the same as
               Hispanic women about weight.

58   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EXTREME EARLY MORNING                 58

     The house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.

                         NARRATOR

               ....a desire for the comfort of
               fullness.

59   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - FIRST LIGHT                          59

     Bernie asleep on the bed...Kleenex abounds...the solid sleep
     earned by a few hours of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty
     and decidedly round. Flor looks for, finds and carries out
     the new clothes Deborah had given her daughter.

                          NARRATOR

               And, when that desire is suppressed
               for style and deprivation allowed
               to rule...




                                                               42.








60   EXT. STREET - STEEP INCLINE                                  60


     ANGLE ON DEBORAH & KILLER HILL:

     Two young athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of
     her on the steep incline.

                         DEBORAH

               Left..left..

     ON RUNNERS.

     They turn and look confused at Deborah who is so far behind
     them she has no need to pass..They turn away. Deborah
     struggles to turn it on and does so...huffing to just behind
     them where she utters one more strained:

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Left.
     And then passes.

                         NARRATOR

               ...dieting, exercising American
               women become afraid of everything
               associated with being curvaceous,
               such as wantonness, lustfulness,
               sex, food, motherhood..all that is
               good in life.

61   INT. CLASKY MAID'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING.                     61

     Flor at work on a sewing machine..opening seams, moving
     buttons, even steaming where the buttons have been
     changed..etc.

62   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - MORNING                                 62

     Flor is in the room...having put the altered clothes back in
     place..Bernie's alarm clock rings..She wakes and sees Flor.

                         BERNICE

               Hey..buenas dias, Flor..
     Flor holds up the new clothes and indicates that they are
     beautiful.

                         BERNICE (CONT'D)

                   (ruefully)
               Yes..Well, taste she has..
     Bernie starts her morning routine..her back to us when:

                         FLOR

                   (damn good English)
               Just try it on.




                                                         43.







Bernie, though her back is to us, does a "take" then turns
grinning.

                    BERNICE

          Hey!!!! When did you learn to...

                    FLOR

              (cutting her off)
          Just try it on..

                    BERNICE

          Too tight..it doesn't fit.
Flor clearly doesn't understand..

                    FLOR

          Just try it on..Hey?!
Flor extends a blouse and skirt.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          Just..

                    BERNICE

          Okay. I'll show you..
She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on,
muttering pessimistically before she does so. CAMERA STAYS ON

FLOR..


                    BERNICE (O.C.) (CONT'D)

          Lovely way to start the day.
          World's most trim Mexican learns
          her first sentence and uses it to
          watch me grrrrunt my way into...
And then....silence...Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing
the clothes which fit like a glove. Flor beams..then laughs
at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and
looks into the mirror.

INTO MIRROR.

To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods
approval and leaves.

ON BERNIE..

The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she
picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies
it a bit.

CLOSE UP SHIRT..

As Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the
buttons have previously been.




                                                             44.








63   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            63

     Flor at work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges
     her.

                         FLOR

                   (to dog)
               Lo siento. No.
     Chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..Bernie enters. She
     is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with
     one word.

                         BERNICE

               Hey..
     Flor turns..Bernie moves to embrace her.

64   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER              64

     As John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From
     the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going
     out the front door as he turns to check it out.

65   INT. DEN - DAY..                                             65

     John finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes. They
     are singing an old song...something like "LUSH LIFE" -
     something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't
     knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him
     and stop.

                         EVELYN

               Every time he has a nightmare, I
               teach him one of my old songs. That
               way the nightmares have a purpose.

                         GEORGIE

               But I don't have to sing it for
               anyone.

                         JOHN

               Right. You're clear on that..

                         GEORGIE

               How many did you sell of this song?

                          EVELYN

                   (embarrassed in front of
                    John)
               He likes to know that stuff.

                         JOHN

                   (to Georgie)
               She was huge.




                                                                45.








                          EVELYN

                Seventy-six thousand..which is
                great for a jazz album.
      They resume harmonizing. As John leaves, the song lyric
      making some comment on:

66    EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                      66

      As John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum
      proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick
      up the New York Times. John's body chemistry launches a
      surprise attack...anxiety and dread...He takes his newspaper
      to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the
      section..opens to the page..and just like that his life
      changes forevermore.

67    INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     67

      John enters..Georgie is going up the stairs..Flor putting out
      breakfast food.

                            EVELYN

                You okay?

                           JOHN

                    (strangely)
                I am okay.
                    (to Flor)
                Deborah around?

                            FLOR

                She run.
      John nods and heads upstairs.

                                                                 67A


67A   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY

      He looks in Bernie's room. She is loading her backpack for
      school..

                          JOHN

                Hey, honey.

                          BERNICE

                What's wrong?

                          JOHN

                No..nothing...just that..
      Georgie enters the scene..

                          GEORGIE

                A kid offered me a trade..Let me
                show you.

                            JOHN

                Yeah..




                                                               46.







     He starts to follow him to his room.

                         BERNICE

               Dad!!! He can wait.

                         JOHN

               No..It's okay..

                          BERNICE

               Let him wait..Yours is obviously
               important.

                         GEORGIE

               You don't even know how important
               the trade is..

                         JOHN

               Let me just do Georgie.... Here.
     He hands her the newspaper...

68   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - GEORGIE'S ROOM                          68

     We MOVE with John and Georgie to Georgie's room where he goes
     to his collectibles..He holds up a card..

                         GEORGIE

               He says he'll give me any three
               silvers for him.

                         JOHN

               I don't know...This is the one you
               started with..You really want to
               give up your first card?
     Note: this is an involved discussion on both their
     parts..NOTHING in John thinks it is trivial.

                         GEORGIE

               I know..that's why I needed you.

                         JOHN

               ..this is your favorite..

                         GEORGIE

               I think he'd go higher.

                         JOHN

               But it's not numbers..it's.....
     They are interrupted by a never quite heard before sound of
     exultation..

69   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                          69

     Flor and Evelyn jolted..they exit to follow the sound..




                                                             47.








70   INT. BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY                                  70

     As they enter holding the paper. She has been smacked in the
     heart by gleeful and prideful emotions...It is disorienting
     for her to experience the rush of pleasure.

                         JOHN

               For God's sake..why did you...

                         BERNICE

               WHY?!!? CRAZY FATHER, WHY?!? Why
               aren't YOU screaming?..

                         JOHN

               I'm getting there..just the stunned
               thing has to get dealt with...

                         BERNICE

                   (reading from newspaper)
               John Clasky, who at 25 made his
               mark on the New York restaurant
               scene when JAMMED lived up to and
               survived its silly name, has re-
               emerged as a young and confident
               veteran taking chances with his
               combinations in so subtle a
               manner.."

                         GEORGIE

               If he gave me six...

                         JOHN

                   (catching her excitement)
               Wait a minute, your sister's
               talking.
     Evelyn indicates to Flor that the good news is about
     John..and so she studies him a bit..

                         BERNICE

               "...beginning with the succession
               of appetizers, each one with its
               own stunning and fully realized
               agenda, is constantly yet casually
               daring."
                   (emotional and earnest
                    aside)
               Ah, Dad...this is so great...
                   (to others)
               Now here's the thing...
     She tears up...Evelyn rubs Bernie's back..looks at Flor and
     taps her heart...Flor indicates she should leave and does.
     Bernice continues reading with a lovely sense of mission and
     moment. John is taken with his daughter's delivery.




                                                             48.








                         BERNICE (CONT'D)

               "Eating at this perfect smaller,
               passionate restaurant inspires
               one's own abandonment of caution.
               To wit: John Clasky is the best
               chef in the United States."

                         JOHN

                   (genuinely enthusiastic)
               Look how great you read it.

                         BERNICE

                   (massive irony)
               Perfect, Dad.
     Evelyn and Bernice hug him..

                         EVELYN

               John..John...Oh, my God you even
               look different to me....

                         JOHN

               What are you talking about?

                         BERNICE

               I wonder what mom will do?

71   INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                               71

     Deborah is ripping John's clothes off..buttons fly..shreds of
     cloth..John is laughing - happy.

                         JOHN

               What is this?

                         DEBORAH

               I don't know.
     She rips at her own clothes and then exclaims in passion.

                           DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Oooohhch!

72   EXT. NORTH VALLEY - DAY.                                    72

     Flor walks to the news stand - as if to buy something --
     changes her mind and LEAVES THE FRAME only to RETURN A HALF-
     BEAT LATER where she reads to the dealer from a note.

                         FLOR

                   (heavily accented)
               New York Times..

73   INT. FLOR'S APT. - NIGHT...                                 73

     Cristina, standing, translating the review into Spanish for
     her mother...as she comes to the last sentence.




                                                                49.








                          CRISTINA

                Wow..."John Clasky es el mejor chef
                en Los Estados Unidos..

                          FLOR

                    (easily)
                Ah, bravo...

74   INT. CLASKY MASTER BEDROOM - DAY.                            74

     The Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are
     exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top
     BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile
     fades - she hits the skids.

                          DEBORAH

                Oh, damn it --- what am I going to
                do? Everything seems so surely
                pointless...

     ON JOHN.

     This IS WEIRD. And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's
     climax...then, in a relatively small voice.

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                Okay here...okay there...good,
                good, good.
     She falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back
     down the bed from him...

     ON JOHN.

     Puzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming
     his thought...then finally..hesitantly...

                            JOHN

                Hey, Deb?

                           DEBORAH

                    (from the vortex of
                      depression)
                Yeah?
     He scoots to her side.

                          JOHN

                You know, I guess I got used to you
                getting a little blue after
                intercourse...But DURING..??

                          DEBORAH

                Something else I do wrong.
     She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom.




                                                             50.








                         JOHN

               You've gotta stop walking away.

                         DEBORAH

                   (turning)
               If I stay, I will say awful things
               to you that I might not even
               mean..You pick.

                            JOHN

               See ya.
     She exits to the bathroom.

75   INT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY.                                    75

     Very upset as he drives. Then comes to the red light at the
     end of the street and sees Flor walking with others. An
     awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they
     acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers
     with another woman.

                         FLOR

                   (to woman)
               Yo leÌ la crÌtica buena.
     The woman tells Flor how to say it in English.

                         FLOR (CONT'D)

                   (parroting woman)
               I read your good review.
     He nods..still the light doesn't change.

                            FLOR (CONT'D)

               It's nice.
     The light changes.

                         JOHN

               Not so far...How you doing?
     The light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let
     him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer.

                            FLOR

               I do fine.
     He nods and drives off.

76   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY                                     76

     As he enters....the phone is going off the hook..As he passes
     the maitre d's desk. Their conversation is strangely hushed
     and very, very quick.




                                                     51.








                         VICTOR

               Should I stop answering? We're
               booked for two months solid.

                         JOHN

               No, no, no, no, no....I want to
               keep some walk-in business..I want
               this to stay neighborhood.

                         VICTOR

               Impossible. There would be
               riots..You should hear the
               desperation in their voices..Best
               day of my life.

                         JOHN

               We'll serve a full menu at the bar
               then.

                         VICTOR

               Then where do I put the people
               waiting for a table? It won't work.

                         JOHN

               Do this for me.

                         VICTOR

               There's no way.

                         JOHN

               Do this for me or I'll set my hair
               on fire and start punching myself
               in the face.

                         VICTOR

               Huh?

                         JOHN

               Yeah..you're right...that was an
               unusual way for me to make myself
               understood..But you'll do the bar
               thing?

                         VICTOR

               Yes, of course, John..

77   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - DAY                     77


                         PETER

               I need to talk to you.

                         JOHN

               Ah, man..Okay.
     They walk into the cooling room.




                                                             52.








78   INT. RESTAURANT - COOLING ROOM - DAY                      78

     Again there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation
     sparked by John..

                         JOHN

               What's up? What's wrong?

                         PETER

               I've gotten a fantastic offer for
               my own place..Everybody wants to
               back me since the paper came out.

                         JOHN

               What's your reaction?

                         PETER

               Honestly? Because I've had this
               very unusual reaction.

                         JOHN

               Yeah.

                         PETER

               I've had a hard on almost all day
               and it won't go away. Like I'm
               riding on the back seat of a bus
               with bad shocks and every other
               passenger is a gorgeous woman with
               a yellow sports top whose leaning
               over. It's like every dream I ever
               had and some even I didn't have the
               balls to dream..

                         JOHN

               So you're considering taking it?...
                   (he looks at him)
               Okay, here's the thing. I can't
               lose you and still keep the hours
               I'm keeping. I can't do my life
               unless I can hold onto you.
                   (sudden thought)
               I think I just gave you an
               incredible bargaining position.

79   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - NIGHT                               79

     As John and Deborah lay next to each other.

                         DEBORAH

               So you gave away twenty percent of
               the restaurant without talking to
               me about it.

                         JOHN

               Yeah. If I didn't do it - I'd have
               been coming home just to sleep.




                                                             53.








                         DEBORAH

                   (trying to make livid more
                    attractive)
               Remember the other day when you
               asked me the perfect response to
               something I said?...I'm asking you
               now..what would you like my
               response to be to your giving away
               twenty percent of the business
               without asking me?

                         JOHN

                   (with great enthusiasm)
               "You're ma man!"

                         DEBORAH

               Okay! So that would be???

                         JOHN

               My dream response from you, yes.

                         DEBORAH

                   (measured)
               I'm not quite there..Actually, I
               just had this flash that the reason
               women in the old days used to faint
               was to avoid doing acts of violence
               against men.
                   (a beat then)
               And I was all worried about
               figuring out the timing just to
               talk to you about renting a place
               for the summer.

                         JOHN

               Well, I think you got your timing.

80   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                     80

     A man is parked at the gate in an open convertible..He is
     great looking...We HEAR Deborah's excited voice over the gate
     speaker...

                         DEBORAH

               Be right out...

81   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - DAY..                                81

     As Deborah calls behind her as she opens the door...

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Mom, you want to come?..the
               realtor's here..Okay, see you
               later.
     She clicks the gate open and walks to the man..perfect 40
     year old great looking surfer sort..Deborah does the very
     slightest of "takes" at his looks..As she gets in..




                                                                54.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Hi.

                         REALTOR

               I'm Mike..there's one great rental
               that just came on..so we're
               starting at the top..
     As they pull away...

82   EXT. CONVERTIBLE - DAY..                                     82

     Deborah's hair whips across her face...it's bothersome.

                         DEBORAH

               I'll never be one of those girls
               whose hair blows perfectly in a
               convertible.

                         REALTOR

               Move your seat forward..
     Puzzled, she uses the electric lever and the seat budges
     forward..

                         REALTOR (CONT'D)

               A little more..just..good.
     The Realtor uses his switches and raises his window a
     bit..her window a bit less and monkeys the position of the
     half windows in back...Deborah turns around checking out the
     odd tweaking and then faces forward. Her hair blows perfectly
     and beautifully behind her...

                         DEBORAH

               Oh, you must be trouble.
     On his small laugh...

83   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                        83

     As they move toward the house...seeing the beach beyond.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Gorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous,
               beautiful. What word is the same in
               Spanish?

                            FLOR

               Fabuloso.

                         DEBORAH

                   (taking it as a
                    compliment)
               Thanks.




                                                               55.








84   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                       84

     As Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               I don't care if it's a rental..this
               place is getting a fixing.
     She leads Flor to a small bedroom.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (to Flor with gestures)
               This will be yours..
     Flor doesn't understand..certainly doesn't want to.

                         EVELYN

               Did you ask her if she could live
               in?

                         DEBORAH

               Come on...there's no buses from her
               to here. There's no question.
               Double come on...
     Deborah uses her hand as if weighing something momentous like
     the law vs. the bible then with heavy sarcasm.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               The Barrio - Carbon Beach..The
               Barrio - Carbon Beach. What to do?
                   (to Flor)
               Don't worry. I'm putting nicer
               stuff in here too.
     When Flor gives no indication of anything - just standing,
     somewhat stupefied..Deborah takes her by the hand and leads
     her out.

85   EXT. CLASKY - BEACH RENTAL - DAY                            85

     As they move through a little courtyard area toward the
     street.

                         DEBORAH

               You must learn English. Why won't
               she learn English? I'm going to
               have to learn, "you must learn
               English," in Spanish.

                         EVELYN

               I think Flor is perfect and we
               should do all we can to keep her
               from changing.

                         DEBORAH

               Gee, you took the words right out
               of my mouthay.




                                                             56.








86   EXT. PCH - DAY                                               86

     As she leads Flor along the highway side of Carbon Beach -
     passing houses until she sees a Hispanic man washing
     someone's car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back.

                          DEBORAH

                Oh, good. Do you speak English?

                             HISPANIC MAN

                Yes, I do.

                          DEBORAH

                Would you translate for me?
     He looks at Flor..my God.

                          HISPANIC MAN

                Sure...forever.
     He speaks to her in Spanish..a lavish, poetic compliment.
     Flor, in full control, says, in Spanish.."Would you please
     just find out what she wants." Evelyn joins them.

                          DEBORAH

                Wait till I say something before
                you start in..
                    (he looks at her)
                I rented a house here for the
                summer and now she must sleep at
                the house because of the bus
                schedule.
     He translates along with Deborah's speech.

     ON FLOR.

     Stricken. She turns to Deborah.

                          FLOR

                No.. Sorry.

                             DEBORAH

                What? Why?
     Flor talks briefly in Spanish.

                          HISPANIC MAN

                She can't because of her daughter.

                          DEBORAH

                You have a daughter? You have a
                whole daughter you haven't
                mentioned..How old?

                             FLOR

                Twelve.




                                                        57.








                     DEBORAH

              (to Evelyn)
          It's a little crazy that I don't
          know that.
The man translates.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

              (to man)
          Don't translate asides.
The man says in Spanish to Flor.."You work for her?"--Flor
answers, "just tell her that I can't live here." Deborah
doesn't like that the man has initiated more conversation.

                      DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          Hey!

                    HISPANIC MAN

          She can't live here. Her daughter.

                    DEBORAH

          Okay..
              (beat then big decision)
          Her daughter can also live with us
          for the summer..
The man tells Flor..she answers directly to Deborah..

                     FLOR

              (big decision)
          No, sorry.

                      DEBORAH

          Why?
The man asks Flor who speaks in Spanish..

                    HISPANIC MAN

          I don't know. She just doesn't want
          to.

                    DEBORAH

          Will you please just tell me what
          she said.

                    HISPANIC MAN

          She said, "I just don't want to."

                    EVELYN

          If she didn't tell us about her
          child she has to have a deep sense
          of privacy. We can figure out how
          she can still live at home. Hell, I
          don't mind driving her at night.




                                                             58.








                         DEBORAH

               Let's spare the world you on the
               roads.
                   (to Flor)
               Well, what do we do?
     The Hispanic man translates the last sentence. Deborah and
     Flor stare at each other..Deborah's next words are somber and
     have enough body language to transcend the need for
     translation...the jig is up.

                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                   (big decision)
               I'm sorry, my friend, this is what
               I need. It's just for the summer. I
               don't want to lose you. But ....
     Flor indicates there is no need to translate. A beat.

                         FLOR

                   (enormous decision)
               Yo vivo aquÌ.

                         HISPANIC MAN

               She'll live here.
     The man says something in Spanish to Flor as she starts to
     walk away and she is thrown enough by the statement to
     actually stumble as she looks back at him...then, before
     Deborah can admonish him.

                         HISPANIC MAN (CONT'D)

               I said, "God protect you from that
               boss."

87   EXT. FLOR'S APT. COMPLEX - DAY                               87

     As Cristina, trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down
     the stairs moving towards a truck from John's restaurant.
     Flor follows tight lipped - resolved. They each carry many
     clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls on the balcony
     literally cheer Cristina on.

                         BALCONY GIRLS

                   (accented)

               MAL-----I------BU!

     Cristina grins hugely back at them.

88   INT. MALIBU TUNNEL - DAY                                     88

     The two women in the truck and then..

89   INT. TRUCK - DAY.                                            89

     As the truck leaves the tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and
     waves..Cristina taking it in, unaware that her mother's eyes
     never leave her.




                                                             59.







     She gasps frequently..MAJOR GIANT ORGANIC GASPS OF WONDER AND
     PLEASURE..This is awe as an active physical exercise. The
     MOVING SHOT dramatizes the crossroads of the mother-daughter
     relationship as the TWO SHOT finds Flor becoming first
     blurred then lost as we focus on Cristina exclaiming over
     each new sight.

                         NARRATOR

                   (over this incidental
                    dialogue)
               The first time one sees natural
               beauty which is owned by others
               confounds the senses.. I had never
               imagined the word "money" could be
               associated with anything but the
               anxiety of not having enough. I
               didn't know God had a toy store for
               the rich.

90   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - STREET SIDE - DAY                 90

     The truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front
     door into a court yard.

91   EXT. CLASKY BEACH HOUSE - BEACH SIDE - DAY                  91

     Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to CHUM in the manner of
     people trying to excite dogs.

                         GEORGIE

               Who wants to go swimming?..Yes, who
               wants to go swimming?
     The dog goes crazy with excitement -- then, droll for a nine
     year old, Georgie turns to his grandmother (who is sunning
     herself and reading) and addresses her in precisely the same
     way. Evelyn has a drink in hand..

                         GEORGIE (CONT'D)

                   (to grandmother)
               Who wants to go swimming?..Huh..

                         EVELYN

               Not now..But I promise I'll go in
               the summer after next.
     John enters the scene..

                         JOHN

               You want to go swimming?

                         GEORGIE

               Oh yeah, you're off.

                         JOHN

               What do you think, wet suits?




                                                              60.








                         GEORGIE

               Wet suits are for wimps..

                         JOHN

               Yeah, you're right..let me get
               mine..
     Georgie laughs..

                         GEORGIE

                   (to Dad)
               You're good.

92   INT./EXT. HALLWAY / PATIO - DAY                              92

     Behind Flor and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and
     their destiny....Flor behind her daughter.

     REVERSE - CLOSE ON CRISTINA.

     As her eyes pop on seeing the Clasky beach house.

     VERY CLOSE ON DEBORAH

     As her eyes pop on seeing the stunning twelve year-old enter
     her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor less distinct in
     the background.
     Bernice, just outside the open patio door, is putting on a
     shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at Cristina and
     emits a small, prescient moan.

                         DEBORAH

                   (to Flor)
               Look at this child..Flor, you could
               make a fortune at surrogate
               pregnancy....
     Flor looks to her daughter for some understanding of what
     Deborah said..

                         FLOR

               Que?
     Cristina is as nonplussed by the remark as her mother.

                         JOHN

               Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you.
                   (to Flor indicating
                    Cristina)
               Great..

                         DEBORAH

                   (to Cristina)
               Hi. This is my daughter,
               Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out
               there...are Georgie and.




                                                        61.







As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has
almost reached them ..

                    EVELYN

          I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan
          of your mother's.

                    CRISTINA

          I'm Cristina.
As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top
which is half tucked in.

                    BERNICE

              (kidding around but right
               on)
          No comparisons, please, no
          comparisons.
Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self-
deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish.

                    CRISTINA

          My mother says it's best if we get
          out of the way and put our things
          away.

                    JOHN

          Have you ever been to the beach
          here?

                    CRISTINA

          I've never been anyplace but Mexico
          and Texas.....before today.
John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with
beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards.

                    JOHN

          Here's the most important place in
          the house..grab this stuff whenever
          you want.

                    CRISTINA

              (delighted)
          Thank you..thank you so much.

                    DEBORAH

          Very little accent?

                       FLOR

                 (suspiciously)
          Que?

                    CRISTINA

              (to Flor)
          Sin acento.




                                                                62.







     Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with,
     nods.

                           CRISTINA (CONT'D)

                     (to Deborah)
                 Thank you..there's an A.P. total
                 fluency class where they work you
                 pretty hard at sounding American.
     Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended
     conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a
     word.

                              FLOR

                 Cristina..

                           DEBORAH

                 Right. Settle in..

                           CRISTINA

                 Thank you. I am thrilled to be
                 here.

93   INT. MAID'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                 93

     Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual
     brilliance...Flor is tense..distraught...her daughter
     giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of
     towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go
     swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of
     being here...the spirit of the kid such that Flor relents....

94   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                         94

     Flor and Cristina, two sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights
     from the beach homes.

     OTHER ANGLE.

     John and Georgie in the waves..body surfing...they get to
     shore...John sees the two females..dashing in the water in
     their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave
     as they run in...then once they are in he starts taking off
     his wet suit hurriedly...

     ON JOHN..

     As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment.

95   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT                95

     Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking
     out.

     As Deborah steps out on the deck and sees Cristina.




                                                                63.








                            DEBORAH

                      (in a loud whisper)
                  Hey, Cristina...hey...hey..What are
                  you doing up?
     Cristina looks around -- then up..

                            CRISTINA

                  Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just
                  excited.

                            DEBORAH

                  I know..Would you believe I had to
                  talk my husband into this?
                      (no reply/then more
                       pointedly)
                  Would you believe I had to talk my
                  husband into it?...do you hear me?

                            CRISTINA

                  Yes...I just ..
                      (awash..a shy laugh)
                  I didn't know what to say?

                            DEBORAH

                      (still calling down)
                  Do you want to come with me? -- I'm
                  going to the flea market.

                            CRISTINA

                  I don't know what that...

                            DEBORAH

                  It's the Rose Bowl... miles, actual
                  miles, of great things for sale for
                  God's sake...We can have brunch in
                  Pasadena.

                            CRISTINA

                  I don't want to wake my mother so
                  early.

                            DEBORAH

                  I'll leave her a note...I'll

97   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - MORNING - TWO HOURS LATER                 97

     As Flor wakes..looks around.

                              FLOR

                  Cristina?
     She goes to Cristina's bed...atop the bed is a note. She
     picks it up.

     INSERT..THE NOTE

     Dear Flor,




                                                             64.







     I decided to steal your daughter for a bit.

     LOVE,


     DEBORAH

     With great energy born of bottled fury, Flor begins to go
     through her daughter's things...finding her backpack and
     extracting a Spanish/English dictionary.

     INSERT DICTIONARY.

     As her finger points to:
     "Steal...robar"
     And then she flips some pages feverishly..Her finger
     indicating:
     "daughter .... hija"

98   EXT. PCH - EARLY AFTERNOON.                                 98


                         DEBORAH (CONT'D)

               Stop thanking me. I love having the
               company.

                         CRISTINA

               It was an adventure which I'll
               remember.

                         DEBORAH

               Your English is genius. Do you
               dream in Spanish or English?

                         CRISTINA

               Just recently I've had a dream in
               English.

                         DEBORAH

               What was it?

                         CRISTINA

               I am so sorry. I -- uh..I'd ..I uh,
               can't tell ..This is so
               uncomfortable.

                         DEBORAH

               You could have just said you didn't
               remember.

                         CRISTINA

               I, uh, guess so..but I do.

                         DEBORAH

               Look who's sensational.




                                                              65.








99    EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY.                        99

      Evelyn is sitting on the patio making sangria..Flor enters.
      She is pissed.

                          EVELYN

                What's wrong?
      She shows her the letter. Evelyn reads it and hands it
      back..She is about to offer something..Flor waves it off and
      enters the house..John comes in from the beach with his
      kids..boogie boards...Evelyn hands him the letter..

                          EVELYN (CONT'D)

                She's wild-eyed over this..
      John moves after Flor as Bernie reads the letter..

                           BERNICE

                Aw, shit..
                    (then quickly)
                Sorry about the word, Georgie.

                             GEORGIE

                It's okay.

                          BERNICE

                You want to know what happened?

                          GEORGIE

                No thank you.

100   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                   100

      John enters..

                          JOHN

                Hey, Flor..
      She turns..

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                I'm sorry..very sorry..
      He indicates his watch -- then holds his fingers together.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                They should be back soon..
      Flor starts to cry. She sits in a chair..He sits not far from
      her.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Hey, Flor..
      Embarrassed, she says, in Spanish, to please leave her
      alone..she turns from him..He walks to the wet bar and gets a
      bottle of water...pours some..Her crying soft in the

background...He walks to her, sits near her and offers her
the glass of water which she takes.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            Deborah made a mistake. I
            understand how you feel...Do you
            understand me at all, generally? Is
            simpático the word?
He pats her on the back..She looks at him..

CLOSE ON FLOR..

Is he coming on?..

HER POV..

His kind eyes.

FULL SHOT..

This is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people
finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she
duplicates his gesture and pats his back.

                      FLOR

            Simpático, yes.
And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she
is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been
with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to
stop her.

                      JOHN

            Un momento, huh?
She stops and turns to him.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            I'm really sorry this is happening.
            I just want you to know that. I am
            real sorry.
He taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a
flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her.

                      JOHN (CONT'D)

            I didn't mean..
He makes a gesture of ardent love..

                        JOHN (CONT'D)

            I meant..
Makes a person to person innocent gesture..She finds herself
smiling.




                                                              67.








                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Well, the good thing about being an
                idiot is that every once in a while
                you cheer people up..Got to get to
                work.

      CAMERA STAYS WITH FLOR

      As he exits...thinks about John's demeanor, smiles again,
      shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for Cristina.

101   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - SUNSET.                    101

      Deborah's SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to
      carry things in...(NOTE: Cristina's hair has been restyled.)

102   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY                        102

      Evelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All
      staring at her.

                          DEBORAH

                What? Something bad happen?

      ON CRISTINA..

      Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Cristina, tell your mother I just
                played around with your hair..she
                can put it back..no hurt feelings.

                          CRISTINA

                Not right now.
      Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and
      speaking to her forcefully in Spanish.

                           DEBORAH

                What? --

                          EVELYN

                You can't just take someone
                else's.....

                          DEBORAH

                Nuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or
                I'll go there and you know where
                "there" is.
      Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to
      Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm
      around her. A pleasant surprise..




                                                                 68.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  Can you believe what Flor is making
                  this into..Shoot me if I ever get
                  that hard to deal with.
      Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream.

103   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - EVENING                                  103

      MUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in
      Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad.
      Cristina enormously uncomfortable.

      INSERT - THE PAD.

      The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina
      winces with the words she records even while punctuating
      perfectly.

                            PAD WRITING

                  You cannot take my child without my
                  permission..And, if you had asked
                  me I would not have given
                  permission. Is this why you did not
                  ask? Because you knew this. You
                  have no rights over my private
                  life.

      ON FLOR..

      Reaching a decisive conclusion.

                            PAD

                  If you have any disagreement with
                  this, I no longer wish to work
                  here.

      ON CRISTINA'S LOOK

      This is awful news.

      ON FLOR.

      For a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's
      hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits.

104   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY          104

      Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out
      to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She
      actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.

                            DEBORAH

                  What's this?
      Flor shakes the letter at her.

      OTHER ANGLE..





                                                                69.







      Showing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage
      prompter in the wings.

                           FLOR

                For you.

                           DEBORAH

                From?
      Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own
      chest.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                You are not yourself...This was
                written in anger. You sleep on it
                and then if you still want me to
                have it -- fine..I don't think you
                will once calm and rational thought
                returns. Just sleep on it.
      Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving
      Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself
      and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we
      hear before scene's end is "mañana."

105   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING         105

      Deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running
      clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes
      off and John awakens.

                          JOHN

                She didn't even want us to know she
                had a daughter - then, on the first
                day, you take the kid without
                asking. I think that's...

                          DEBORAH

                    (starting to lose it)
                What!?! Insensitive? Elitist?
                Irresponsible? Perverse? Dizzy?

                          JOHN

                    (slow and emphatic)
                Dumb.
      She looks at him...He has been atypical...Her immediate
      emotional cocktail is panic, fury and deep, deep hurt. Her
      words are slow...her voice ragged...

                          DEBORAH

                When is anyone in this damn house
                or this damn life going to consider
                my feelings? I just tried to make
                a lovely kid feel welcome. There's
                no reason to rake it over...I let
                it go..and gave Flor the room to
                let it go. Which I'm sure she has!
                It's over!! So get on board.




                                                              70.







      She opens the door and almost runs into Flor who is standing
      immediately in her way holding the letter.

                           FLOR

                I slept.

106   INT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DEN - DAY                     106

      Deborah stands over Cristina, who is writing in Spanish a
      note Deborah is dictating. As John passes through the room.

                          DEBORAH

                I am deeply and sincerely sorry to
                have upset you. Especially in
                light of the deep connection, as
                women, I believe us to have.

                          EVELYN

                    (sotto to John)
                And to think I was worried about
                Flor living here with her kid?

107   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - PATIO                         107

      John is talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the
      overall atmosphere. IN THE BACKGROUND we see Deborah handing
      Flor her letter..Cristina taking sidelong glances...relieved
      to see them shake hands (Flor engaging), hug (Flor
      reluctant).

                          JOHN

                So here's the idea..I want to make
                a serving platter for serving fish
                using sea glass like this..
      He holds out some sea glass.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                I used to hunt for this stuff every
                free minute when I apprenticed in
                Italy. This is bits of broken glass
                that the ocean sand blasts over the
                years..great looking, huh? So you
                guys go hunting and I'll pay 50
                cents for any piece, a dollar for
                anything as big as this and five
                dollars for any color that isn't
                brown, clear or green.

                          GEORGIE

                Do we have to do this?

                          BERNICE

                    (to Georgie)
                Oh, come on...
      Georgie and Bernice start off..




                                                                 71.








                          JOHN

                Come on, Cristina - go get em.
      Her eyes widen and off she runs, intoxicated with being
      included and having the chance to make money.

108   EXT. BEACH - DAY - VARIOUS SHOTS                            108

      The kids combing through pebbles.
      Georgie becoming bored and stopping..
      Bernie stopping.

109   EXT. BEACH - SAME SCENE - SUNSET..                          109

      Lots of people on their decks..hot-tubbing, sunning,
      partying..rich people forming New Yorker cartoons in the
      background as Cristina continues to doggedly collect her sea
      glass. At one point, she comes upon a teenage couple making
      out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll
      over so she can search the area.

110   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - PRE-DAWN                                 110

      Cristina arising..

111   EXT. BEACH - PRE-DAWN..                                     111

      Cristina collecting sea glass.

112   EXT. BEACH - SAME SCENE - NIGHT.                            112

      Illuminated by the surf lights of the beach homes, Cristina
      plugs away.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:


113   EXT. CLASKY'S RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON.          113

      John exits his door and steps to his car..as he is about to
      get in..

                             CRISTINA'S VOICE

                Excuse me.
      He looks up and steps around to where she is...there is a
      battered wood table along the side of the house.

                          JOHN

                Hi..what's doing?
      She overturns a large bucket and a small mountain of sea
      glass spills on the table.

                             JOHN (CONT'D)

                I'm broke.




                                                     72.








                    CRISTINA

              (feeling horrible)
          No..you don't have to pay..I'm
          sorry. Don't worry, please.

                    JOHN

          No. I'm kidding..Instead of a
          platter -- I'll just build a sea
          glass building and serve fish
          inside... Great, Cristina..Why
          don't you count it and..

                    CRISTINA

          I have... Many times..I didn't
          sleep. I counted.

                    JOHN

          So what's the damage...total?
Her eyes locked on his.

                    CRISTINA

              (dead serious)
          It depends on whether you consider
          these four a color other than
          green, brown or clear..
She takes them from her pocket.

                    JOHN

          Well, this one is borderline.

                     CRISTINA

          I agree.

                    JOHN

          Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody
          finds a blue..You know how a blue
          happens? I mean, before the ocean
          blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody
          had to throw away an old Milk of
          Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk
          of Magnesia is?

                    CRISTINA

          Unfortunately.
He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her.

                    JOHN

          So how much for the whole deal?

                    CRISTINA

              (unable to look at him)
          Eleven hundred and one dollar.
He reacts..then..




                                                                73.








                          JOHN

                Okay. We'll finish dealing with it
                when I get home from work.
      She gasps..

114   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - ONE A.M.                                114

      Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears
      John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor.

115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115

      As she enters from the back room and sees that John is
      walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on
      which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it.

116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116

      John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will
      be late. He is disappointed.

117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117

      Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out
      a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding
      it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity...

                             FLOR

                Cristina..
      She turns...the wad of money in her hand..

118   INT. POCKET KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                           118

      The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a
      salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as
      a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and
      copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a
      guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest...

119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119

      He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just
      about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish
      voices approaching. He looks up.

      ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA

      As they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words.

                          CRISTINA

                My mother wishes me to represent
                exactly what she says, nothing
                else.




                                                         74.







And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in
Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her
mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is
not only a translation but a reenactment.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          May I talk to you?

                    JOHN

          You mean your mother....
Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only
speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

              (looking at Flor)
          Sure you can talk to me..
Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish..

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I don't have to sleep first?

                    JOHN

          What's wrong?
Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she
speaks for her mother.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          Did you give this money to my
          daughter?

                    JOHN

          I made this little deal..with all
          the kids to...

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

              (interrupting)
          Please..
Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now
translates from the background.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)

          You don't tell or ask the mother
          when you give a child a fortune for
          looking on the beach for
          stones..what is the word for this..

                       JOHN

          Sea glass?
On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor
turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him.




                                                           75.








                      CRISTINA AS FLOR

            No..not a name for the stones..a
            name for the act..what you did..

ON FLOR..

As she spits out the word to her daughter.

                        FLOR

            EngreÌdo.

ON JOHN..

As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear.

                      JOHN

            Oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be
            rough.

ON CRISTINA..

Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to
deliver the word.

                      CRISTINA

                (briefly being herself)
            It's hard to translate.
She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out.

                        CRISTINA AS FLOR

            Smug.
John gets up and takes a conciliatory step toward Flor so
that now Cristina is in the middle looking up at them as she
translates for John

                      JOHN

            I had no idea it would amount to
            that kind of money..I thought ---
            sort of tops fifty dollars.

                      CRISTINA AS FLOR

            Fifty dollars is a lot of money..

                      JOHN

            Okay. Right.
He has no idea where to take it from here -- the two females
look as he searches for the right thing to say..

                       JOHN (CONT'D)

                (sighing to himself)
            Ah, shit..
That fast Cristina translates.. Before Flor can react. John
talks directly to Flor..quiet,compassionate, a bit beaten.




                                                           76.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          I'm sorry....I get why you are
          upset. It might not look it but I
          am good at getting things. Doing
          something about it is something
          else..I was going to talk to you
          before I actually gave her the
          money..but maybe I should have
          checked before I started the whole
          thing.
              (he smiles/they don't)
          I know what it's like when you feel
          your kid is being messed with..I
          get the message. It won't happen
          again. It's late..I'm sure we'd all
          like...
Flor lets it out...her daughter hard pressed to keep up.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          To what..sleep? If this was small
          enough to be helped by some little
          apology, I would be a fool to bring
          it up..I need to say more no matter
          what the result. I need to be
          impolite. You leave someone else's
          child alone. It's simple, no? It
          is too easy for children to feel
          contradictions..It encourages
          questioning their parents..and that
          makes them less safe. Your wife
          takes her for rides and changes her
          hair..You give her money. Here..
              (this next sentence
               Cristina translates with
               alarm and adds her own
               question mark.)
          Take back the money????????????
Flor hands John the envelope under her daughter's wrenching
gaze. They begin to exit..but Flor turns inadvertently
bumping into her daughter. Her voice softens.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D)

          I did not mean to be angry to you -
          only emotional..
They turn to leave. John speaks with sudden volume and
muscle.

                    JOHN

          What about hypocritical?
Cristina turns back..confused..her mother asks her for a
translation and she complies.. Flor then wearing the same
confused expression.




                                                        77.








                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Yeah, you heard me. It's not like
          you didn't do the same thing...

                      FLOR

                (hard on the translation)
          No!

                    JOHN

          Oh, yes. So go lecture
          yourself..you won't need a
          translator for that one...I mean
          what am I lately... A recycling
          bin?..just anyone dump in your
          garbage and hope I make something
          useful out of it...
Flor is confused and getting pissed but he is moving now and
pointing a finger at her.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Yes, you did the same thing...you
          think I didn't know about altering
          those outfits for Bernie..She tells
          me her stuff....So, am I missing
          something? Is there a real
          difference between that and what
          you are complaining about?
Cristina waits for a comeback from her mother to
translate..but doesn't get one..Instead her mother is a bit
mortified and considerably humbled..the pie smack into the
face.

                    FLOR

          Sin diferencia. Yo interferÌ.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          No difference. I interfered.

                    JOHN

          Okay......I'm still not sure I did
          the right thing keeping it to
          myself. It felt disloyal to
          Deborah..but my daughter really
          needed someone to be kind to her
          right then..so..so.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I am very embarrassed. You are very
          right. Hypocrisy..yes.




                                                        78.








                    JOHN

              (something strikes him, he
               softens, disoriented)
          I'll tell you, it's pretty wild to
          say something and have the other
          person just concede the point. I'm
          dazed here.

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          I will leave whenever it is good
          for you and...

                    JOHN

          No..no..come on, man..

                    CRISTINA AS FLOR

          But how can I work for you after we
          talk like this?

                    JOHN

          You can't quit even if you want to
          and you know why.

                    FLOR

          No..

                    JOHN

          Yes, you do..
Flor is worried as John looks right at her..Is he coming on?

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Because then Cristina will blame
          herself for costing you the
          job...and that guilt...I don't know
          if you know about guilt..
Cristina doesn't have to check with her mother on this one.

                     CRISTINA

          Culpa, guilt, sÌ. We know. We are
          Catholics.

                    FLOR

              (after her daughter's
               translation)
          Culpa, si..Por Dios, Si.

                    CRISTINA

              (on her own)
          We know.

                    FLOR

              (big nod)
          We know.
John gestures that there is nothing to be done. Flor nods.

                          JOHN

                So, welcome back.
      She smiles..gets up..extends her hand..they shake.

                          FLOR

                Good night, Mr. Clasky..

                          CRISTINA

                Good night As they exit..their
                backs to John, daughter following
                mother...Flor speaks to her
                daughter.

                          FLOR

                    (an aside)
                No te puedo tener haciendo esto por
                mi. Ahora tengo que aprender
                inglÈs.

                          CRISTINA AS FLOR

                    (over her shoulder to John
                     as they move)
                I can't have you doing this for me.
                I must learn English now.

                          FLOR

                No, dije eso por ti - no por John.
      That translates to "No, I meant that for you, not John." But
      Cristina does not translate the line. Nor..

                          JOHN

                You have a wonderful mother.

                          FLOR

                Que?

                          CRISTINA

                Nada.

120   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 120

      A Spanish commercial for learning English in a hurry is on
      television..Flor on the phone ordering it..

                          NARRATOR

                Learning English would cost five
                hundred and ninety nine dollars
                down and 15 monthly payments of one
                hundred and ten dollars...which
                represents 48 percent
                interest..Mexicans marketing
                Mexicans. But not a penny was
                wasted.




                                                                80.








121   EXT. MAIL BOX - DAY                                        121

      As Flor takes a package from the box.

                          NARRATOR

                My mother showed an extraordinary
                facility for learning the language.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


122   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY                      122

      Flor listening to the tapes as she does laundry.

                          NARRATOR

                ..as well as a totally committed,
                obsessive work ethic, which blocked
                out all else..She was her
                daughter's mother.
      As Flor silently mouths some English while listening to a
      tape,Chum nudges her with a ball and, without thinking, she
      takes it from his mouth and tosses it..Realizing, with alarm,
      a beat too late that she has broken the rule.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


123   EXT. BEACH - LATE AT NIGHT                                 123

      Flor sitting on the sand...listening to her
      tapes..continually forced by Chum's obsessive persistence to
      throw him the ball.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:


124   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              124

      As John arrives...He bumps the walls on entering.

125   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                              125

      As John enters the house, clearly drunk.   There is the sound
      of skittering paws as CHUM approaches.

                          JOHN

                    (cheering)
                Hey, boy, I can use some up
                company.
      But Chum feverishly digs his snout against a nearby piece of
      furniture and retrieves a tennis ball and rockets away. John
      follows, weaving a bit.

126   INT. BEACH HOUSE - DEN - LATE NIGHT                        126

      As John enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to
      Flor who is watching one of video language tapes. She tosses
      the ball without a look or a thought..then starts when she
      sees John standing there. He cheers, seeing her predicament.




                                                        81.




When she speaks English, at this point, her words are
halting.

                    JOHN

          You gotta do something about
          Chum..Your arm's going to go.
She waves it off and hurries to get her tape and get out of
his way. Chum complicates the task, proffering the ball. Flor
wearily throws it.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Don't you sleep anymore?

                    FLOR

          No..You get more if you keep at it.

                    JOHN

          You're doing fantastic.

                    FLOR

          Now I am like a three year-old.
          Your wife go out.

                    JOHN

          She say where?

                    FLOR

          No.
              (on his reaction)
          Sorry.

                    JOHN

          Listen..I just forgot she was going
          out..don't be a smart ass.
              (jolted by his own remark)
          Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate
          mostly in apologies anyway..I'm
          sorry. I should be whipped. I
          should be stoned- it's been a while
          - I meant to say, I think, don't be
          smart, don't be kind, don't be
          sensitive, don't be beautiful. I
          meant to say, "hi, Flor, good night
          Flor..that show you're watching is
          going to be a hit."
He staggers out. Flor watches his lonely back for a beat and
then urgently gestures Chum to join him. Chum is reluctant,
but relenting, runs and accompanies his appreciative master.
Flor, now alone, finds herself staring at a framed picture of
John in the den. He is younger and smiling. She studies the
picture and then blinks when she realizes her own emotion and
purposefully goes back to her lessons.




                                                              82.








127   EXT. P.C.H. - LA SALSA FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY.            127

      Cristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast food
      place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male
      figure on its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV.

                          BERNICE

                How'd you get your mother to let
                you go with my mother?

                          CRISTINA

                Well, your mother just said she
                could use my help on a few errands
                while you're in class...
      Bernice nods. Then unconsciously moans.

                          CRISTINA (CONT'D)

                What?

                          BERNICE

                No. Just that I hate summer school.

                          CRISTINA

                Why do you go then?

                          BERNICE

                    (looks at her)
                I'm not sure I can explain to you
                the concept of not doing well in a
                class..in this case math...and the
                system kind of insists on the
                illusion that you've learned math --
                so they make you go to summer
                school..It helps them avoid facing
                that they have failed in their
                mission.

                          CRISTINA

                What do you mean they failed?

                          BERNICE

                Joking.

                          CRISTINA

                Oh. I see. Forgive me, I don't have
                a real sense of humor.

                          BERNICE

                    (looking skyward)
                Thank you, God.
                    (on Cristina's reaction)
                Joking...

                          CRISTINA

                The joke is?




                                                                83.







      As they get in the car..Bernice doing a little stutter step
      offering Cristina the front seat..Cristina demurs.

128   INT. SUV - DAY.                                            128

      As they get in..Deborah privy to the conversation now.

                          BERNICE

                That you're better at everything
                than I am...and I was thanking God
                for there being this one thing
                where I might have my nose in
                front.
      Deborah can't think of what single thing Bernice could
      possibly feel superior about. She is genuinely puzzled.

                          DEBORAH

                And that thing is???
      Bernice deeply resents the question..She turns to her mother.

                          BERNICE

                Sexual experience..
      Cristina laughs.

                          BERNICE (CONT'D)

                    (ruefully to self)
                That one even she knows is funny.
      Cristina gives Bernice an appreciative push from behind.
      Deborah, for some reason, feels she deserves credit for their
      connection.

                          DEBORAH

                Look at you girls.

129   INT. BEACH BEDROOM - DAY                                   129

      Deb working an outfit..her mother eyeing her..

                          DEBORAH

                Cristina's already read, on her
                own, everything on Bernice's summer
                reading list..And she's two grades
                behind..Imagine if she went to
                Bernice's school..And they'd kill
                to give her a scholarship.

                          EVELYN

                Talk to Flor...

                          DEBORAH

                    (sarcastic)
                Yeah..she's so open to new things.




                                                              84.








130   EXT. GORGEOUS PRIVATE SCHOOL -DAY.                          130

      Deborah and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking
      lot...Deborah, feigning upset, tearing into her bag but her
      focus is elsewhere as she periodically looks off. She is
      clearly stalling.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Can't find my keys..
      Another woman, ARLENE FOLSOM, calls to her..

                             ARLENE

                Deborah...

                          DEBORAH

                    (acting surprised)
                Hi, Arlene..
                    (to Cristina)
                Come on.
      They walk to greet Arlene.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Hi. This is Cristina..the girl I'm
                always raving about..This is Arlene
                Folsom..the school director.

                             ARLENE

                Hi..

                          CRISTINA

                    (Barbara Boxer couldn't do
                     it better)
                Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms.
                Folsom. I couldn't believe how
                beautiful the grounds were as we
                drove in. I just think the balance
                of the buildings to open ground is
                so wonderful and must have been
                very difficult to achieve.
      Deborah smiles with pride at the elegant first impression
      Cristina is making..all are grinning...the two adults
      suspiciously so...sharing their delight.

                          ARLENE

                Would you like a little tour?

      MOVING CAMERA..

      First showing Cristina in foreground and her POV of this Drop
      Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in the background and then we
      MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her reaction.

                          NARRATOR

                The experience was literally mind
                boggling. My mind did boggle. My
                cranial cells stunned. Even if I
                had enough sense of wonder to
                imagine such a school existed; my
                sense of fairness made it
                unthinkable that any school could
                offer this much more than my own..

131   INT. BEACH LIVING ROOM - DAY                             131

      This is the last day of the summer rental - many packed
      cartons on the floor. Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a
      momentous conversation..(NOTE: Throughout the following, and
      quite beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the
      motion of throwing the ball. But we do not cut to Chum,
      rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we
      maintain focus on the momentous conversation.)

                          DEBORAH

                Nuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning
                this one on me. I've got to finish
                packing up.

                          FLOR

                    (no longer sure of herself
                     or anything)
                I just don't....Out of space this
                school wants her to go for free?

                          DEBORAH

                We ran into the school head. They
                want diversity...Cristina knocked
                her out...I had nothing to do with
                it. By the way, the scholarship is
                worth twenty thousand dollars. And
                early registration is tomorrow.

                          FLOR

                It is too far from our home.

                          DEBORAH

                You could move in with us in town.

                          FLOR

                Never, thank you...

                          DEBORAH

                Okay, then don't..By the way..the
                phrase is "NO, thank you."

132   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 132

      Flor has her earphones on listening to her English tapes..but
      she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter
      passionately pray in English..soon taking off the ear phones.




                                                              86.








                          CRISTINA

                Please, dear God..Enter my mother's
                heart and make her understand what
                this school would mean.

                          FLOR

                Alright. I look.

                          CRISTINA

                Amen.

133   EXT. L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOL - FLOR AT CRISTINA'S SCHOOL - DAY 133

      Summer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent Hispanic.
      Through Flor's POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn
      but as vibrant with community.

134   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - FLOR AT BERNICE'S SCHOOL - DAY     134

      Highly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale
      students..five percent Latino...No brochure can do it
      justice. Overwhelmed by the implications, Flor's eyes tear.

135   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT                            135

      Cristina sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep.

136   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                            136

      John enters, home from work ... as he passes Flor's door it
      opens and she steps out. Before she can continue on, she sees
      Evelyn at the foot of the stairs, carrying a glass of port.

                          EVELYN

                Hi, Flor, want some port?

                          FLOR

                No, thank you, Evelyn.

                          EVELYN

                    (going up stairs)
                Thanks for never judging me..Love
                you. Love everybody. That's what's
                killing me.. Sleep well.

      EVELYN'S POV.

      She sees Flor approach John. Evelyn looks thoughtful.

137   INT. DEN - LATE NIGHT                                    137

      John is about to pour himself a stiff drink. Flor startles
      him.

                          FLOR

                May I talk with you?




                                                              87.








                           JOHN

                Me?
                    (she nods)
                Deborah will be home soon. I just
                talked to her.

                          FLOR

                I need real talk..Is it okay?
      John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                No?

                           JOHN

                Sure.

                          FLOR

                Outside? Private?

                          JOHN

                Sure.....
                    (as they exit to beach
                     with a nervous laugh)
                You have me a little worried...
      He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are
      not.

138   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                       138

      He sits..she stands, gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically
      blowing her dress against her body. He tries not to notice.

                          FLOR

                You know about Cristina and your
                great school?

                          JOHN

                Oh, it's happened. Is it driving
                you nuts?

                          FLOR

                Yes, nuts. I have no idea what to
                do. Such an important thing.

                           JOHN

                Yeah.

                          FLOR

                It's a good school?

                          JOHN

                Tops. It's tops.

                          FLOR

                So you like it?




                                                        88.








                    JOHN

          No. I hate the damn school. But
          that's because they keep sending my
          daughter home anxiety-ridden,
          mostly over geometry..I mean you
          "get" Bernice..In a decent world
          her school should let her know how
          great she is, right?

                    FLOR

          Very right.

                    JOHN

          So, don't ask me..I'm worried about
          my own kid there.

                    FLOR

          You don't have to worry about
          Bernice. Nothing is going to change
          that heart.
He looks at her..Out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone
echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about
his daughter..It is odd..being this deeply touched before he
knows what hit him..He makes little adjustments until the
moment passes..

                     JOHN

          Um.....yeah..thanks...
              (then)
          It's great to hear someone else say
          that out loud..Hard to explain.

                    FLOR

          I "get" it.

                    JOHN

              (a beat..then deeply, with
               core feelings, a lament)
          Ah, man..

                    FLOR

              (caring)
          It will be okay.

                    JOHN

          No, I was thinking about you..

                    FLOR

              (instantly alarmed)
          Your, "Ah, man" was for me? You
          think I am in trouble with
          Cristina?

                    JOHN

          It's just tough to be sane.

                    JOHN (cont'd)
          To know you're not just making
          something out of nothing. That when
          you think you're at some
          crossroads - you are.

                    FLOR

              (she takes this in/nods)
          ....I never know a man who can put
          himself in my place like you do.
          How do you become that man?

                    JOHN

          I don't know...You introduce two
          Jews in the desert and wait five
          thousand years. Then, bingo,
          somebody else who can see trouble
          coming but can't do anything about
          it.

                    FLOR

          I don't understand.

                    JOHN

          That's okay.

                       FLOR

          I want to.

                    JOHN

          Nothing. I don't know what I'm
          talking about..
A sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way
which cannot be ignored.

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

          Will you sit down.. Get out of the
          damn wind.
She sits. It helps.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          So you going to send her?

                    FLOR

          I don't know. But it does not feel
          good. I think if she goes there it
          will be one of two things..either
          she will be odd...or she will make
          herself the same as them.

                    JOHN

              (in wonderment)
          That is EXACTLY the way I felt
          about Bernice going there..Exactly.

                          JOHN (cont'd)
                I wasn't able to think it that
                clearly...But that's how I felt. So
                between odd and the same...you
                gotta root for odd, don't you?

                          FLOR

                Yes, you gotta.
      Camera begins to pull back...early in the move John's words
      stop the movement.

                          JOHN

                This was a crummy summer.
      Flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.

                          FLOR

                Not all crummy.
      Suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly,
      changing mode.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Thank you, good night. I go sleep.

                          JOHN

                Good night..Hey?
      She turns..

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                You speaking English...It's, uh..

                          FLOR

                What?

                          JOHN

                Nothing. Just.... Nice meeting you.
      She gulps and exits...as the CAMERA PULLS BACK..ending the
      summer at the rented house...as we transition to....

139   EXT. BIG BLUE BUS IN MOTION - MORNING.                    139

      Through the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina.
      Flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in
      her body. Cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an
      incandescent turn. Quite a contrast.

140   EXT. STONE CANYON AND SUNSET - MORNING                    140

      As the bus stops...Bernice is across the street, along with
      some other kids and Deborah, who is wearing her running
      clothes..Flor and Cristina exit the bus...




                                                        91.








                    BERNICE

              (calling)
          You just made it...I was getting
          worried..
Deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to
Cristina..

                     DEBORAH

          I picked up your books yesterday..
              (by way of explanation to
               Flor)
          This is one of Bernie's
          old..ancient backpacks.
Cristina taking it...

                    CRISTINA

          Oh, thank you..
As she shoulders it and almost falls over..

                    CRISTINA (CONT'D)

              (impressed with the heft)
          This is a great school.

                    DEBORAH

              (to Cristina)
          I got you a little first-day-at-a-
          new-school present...
A school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain
deadline pressure on the transaction.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          It's from me and....Bernice.
              (to Flor)
          Okay? It is a big day.
Flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes.

                    BERNICE

              (dry)
          What did we get her?
Deborah hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's
expression.

                     DEBORAH

               (to Cristina)
          It's from ALL of us. Your mother
          too.

                    FLOR

              (to Cristina)
          It's not from me...




                                                                 92.







      Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction
      as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board
      the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women,
      thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her
      daughter.

                          DEBORAH

                Have a great year, girls..
                    (for Flor)
                This is so great. It fills your
                heart, doesn't it?
      Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up
      the hill..

141   EXT. STREET - HILL - ANGLE ON FLOR...                       141

      Walking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own
      fury..Deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor
      keeps walking toward the camera..

                          NARRATOR

                There is a terrible crisis which
                comes when your own personality is
                not equal to the challenge you
                face. When being who you are no
                longer works.
      Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls
      for a clear path well in advance.

                          DEBORAH

                Left...left.
      Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk
      faster...

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Left...left...
      Deborah is close behind now.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)


                LEFT!

      Suddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is lithe and quick.

      ON DEBORAH...

      A blink of confusion...then something resembling innate
      satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the Race is on.

      ANGLE AS DEBORAH DRAWS ABREAST OF FLOR.

      Strangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. She is
      genuinely warm.




                                                              93.








                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                      (to Flor)
                  Why am I not surprised you're
                  competitive?
      Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck.

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  Oh, they're delivering my table.
      Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win
      so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's
      everything...

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                  You are fast.. Better pace yourself
                  though..
      Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it
      all out...

      ON DEBORAH..

      Realizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned
      as she goes after the rabbit.

      OTHER ANGLE.

      Showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance...

      VARIOUS SHOTS..

      Flor fueled by desperation. Deborah, relentlessly gaining,
      exhilarated.

      THE FINISH..

      Decidedly anti-climactic..Deborah draws even -- passes her--
      arrives at the house with a large margin of victory.

                            DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                      (calling back)
                  I love you for trying.

142   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                  142

      She exits into her home.

      ON FLOR..

      Bent over, hands on knees, sweaty, gasping for breath. Flor
      finally straightens up and, there being no other course,
      continues her walk up the hill, to work.

143   INT. CLASKY HOME - NIGHT...                              143

      As John moves past Evelyn on his way to work. She looks at
      him a little wild-eyed as they both stand in the doorway.
      Straining a bit for breath.

                          JOHN

                You feel okay?

                          EVELYN

                No. I've given up drinking.
                    (he looks at her/she sadly
                     nods affirmation)
                I had to do it John..I need every
                brain cell to watch out for all of
                us..given the current climate.
                Anyway. John, I think you're great
                and I'm going to act accordingly.

                           JOHN

                    (totally confused)
                Good deal.

                          EVELYN

                Let's hope.

      Flor cooking alongside Monica --- a table is set for ten..A
      banner proclaiming BIENVENIDA, MAMÁ.

                My great Aunt Monica had finally
                managed to get her mother to Los
                Angeles and my mother was making a
                party.

      they arrive at the Clasky home.

                I was with my friends who had
                helped me understand real optimism.
      As they pull in the driveway. Cristina and her friends exit
      the car and squeal loudly at each other with the excitement
      of having it all. Bernice exits last. She is not squealing.




                                                              95.








146   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - NIGHT                                146

      As Deb finishes dialing a call..Cristina looking on...her two
      friends watching a movie in the family room. A clock
      prominently reads nine p.m.

                              DEBORAH

                       (into phone)
                   Flor? Deb..Look, sorry to call you
                   so late, but they're still studying
                   and I'm going out but I promised to
                   get her back so if you want me to
                   cut off the school work,
                   fine...whatever you want me to do.
                   Well, okay..you think about it..
                       (she holds on to give Flor
                        time)
                   And hey, if you're tired, or want
                   to play, let her sleep here and
                   I'll get her back there tomorrow.
                   You still want to think about it?
                   Okay..
      She hangs up...and exchanges a mischievous look with
      Cristina.

147   INT. FLOR'S APT. - NIGHT                                 147

      As Flor hangs up..

                             NARRATOR

                   Though it is possible to judge
                   harshly my conduct toward my mother
                   in my first year at school; almost
                   all professional literature excuses
                   my behavior as developmental, since
                   I was entering an age where
                   rebellion and narcissism were to be
                   expected. And I was being mentored.
      Monica and her newly arrived mother are there along with the
      bride from an earlier scene and some of the girls who saw
      Cristina off to Malibu..Women cooking in the kitchen..She
      tells the girls, in Spanish, that Cristina may not make it.
      They are disappointed...Flor thinks - then says something to
      Monica who nods in agreement. Flor exits.

148   EXT./INT. CLASKY FRONT DRIVEWAY..NIGHT                   148

      As Evelyn stands there...a little in the shadows..

      HER POV...

      Deborah somewhat dolled up moving through the interior of the
      house..




                                                                96.








149   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                            149

      As Deborah leaves the house in a hurry.

                          EVELYN

                    (calling out)
                Wait!
      Deborah turns, startled.

                          EVELYN (CONT'D)

                I need to talk to you privately,
                honey.

                          DEBORAH

                "Honey?"-- Can't now, Mom...I'm
                late..I was looking all over for
                you...keep an eye on the kids. You
                know my secret cell number.

                          EVELYN

                Just give me a moment to talk
                here..

                          DEBORAH

                What is it? Are you buzzed?

                          EVELYN

                No. I gave up drinking weeks ago.
                    (on Deborah's reaction)
                Yes. Nobody noticed -- which shows
                I probably conducted myself pretty
                well as a drunk. But duty called
                and I'm sober so may I say just one
                thing.

                          DEBORAH

                One thing..go ahead...

                          EVELYN

                Thanks..Deborah, you're going to
                lose your husband and you'll never
                find someone as good. There will
                only be men who you know are cheap
                and shallow and have no real warmth
                in their souls. You may have gotten
                by on those surfaces once but now
                you've been spoiled by a good man
                and you can no longer glide on such
                thin ice. If you do not act
                quickly you will soon cement an
                awful fate for yourself. A life,
                with no hope of repair, which has
                already begun to turn desperate and
                dumb. That's it. Drive safely.
      She grabs a deep breath and then turns and walks to the
      house.




                                                                 97.








                            EVELYN (CONT'D)

                      (to herself)
                  If we're out of coffee, it's over
                  for me.
      Suddenly a sharp horn is heard..Evelyn jumps..then turns to
      see her daughter calling to her from the driver's seat of the

      SUV..


                            DEBORAH

                  You've done it again, Mom, made me
                  hate myself..One of the things I
                  can count on..

                            EVELYN

                  Honey, lately your low self-esteem
                  is just good common sense.
      Deborah considers that last thought for a long beat before
      she drives off..

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:


150   EXT. STONE CANYON - LATE NIGHT...                           150

      Flor walking from the beginning of the hill........She looks
      off to see John's vehicle approaching..She brightens..

      ON JOHN..

      Who doesn't see her..We can see his car's digital clock
      reading 11:30.

      ON FLOR..

      As he drives past her.

151   INT. CLASKY HOME - NIGHT...                                 151

      As John enters..Evelyn, in an adjoining room, moves to
      intercept him.

                            EVELYN (CONT'D)

                  John, better wait a minute.
      But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs..

                            JOHN

                      (concerned)
                  What the hell's wrong?

                            EVELYN

                  Nothing. In all futility, can I
                  urge you not to go up there.
      But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns
      at the top of the stairs WE SEE THE DOOR CLOSE TO BERNICE'S

      ROOM.





                                                              98.








      ON EVELYN..


                             EVELYN (CONT'D)

                       (to herself)
                   Denouement.

152   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT...                           152

      John enters the room on the double...passes Deborah without
      knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some
      such). As he passes....camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a
      mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings
      her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by
      goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability...

                             JOHN

                   Deb..Deb?..where are you?
      He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but
      an instinct leads her astray once more.

                                DEBORAH

                   Here I am.

                             JOHN

                   Baby, what?

                             DEBORAH

                   "Baby?" Stay there, John...Sit
                   down..I suddenly get what I have to
                   do...I just have to get the guts.

                             JOHN

                   Is it absolutely necessary to make
                   it this...this scary..can you just
                   say it?

                             DEBORAH

                   Not so easy.

                              JOHN

                       (tender/ready for the big
                         healing)
                   Yeah..come on..it's me. We can
                   talk.

                             DEBORAH

                   Do I ever hope so...I've been
                   seeing another man for the last
                   eleven weeks and it was nothing and
                   I ended it tonight..At first it was
                   just keeping an eye on the real
                   estate market..Then it was...what?
                   Me being insecure and looking for
                   some ridiculous vali...

      ON JOHN...





                                                        99.







A shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her..

                    JOHN

          Go -- hold on...hold on...I'm
          missing what you're saying..You
          can't just keep talking and expect
          me to follow it when you start the
          way you did.......

                    DEBORAH

          Just what did you hear?

                    JOHN

          Well there was the crack in the
          planet. That was noisy...
She looks at him...a solid beat...

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          There's an actual noise in my
          head.....no kidding..
Briefly he does the noise...

                    DEBORAH

              (slowly)
          I met him about...
John holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself
to hear this..She waits...and waits...as he waits he grows
flushed and stunned with dread. Finally a word..

                    JOHN

          You..
She takes that as a cue to start..

                    DEBORAH

          I met him..
He puts up his hand..

                    JOHN

          If you talk that fast...I'll never
          hear you..there's a lot going
          through my mind....Have you said
          yet whether you slept with him?

                    DEBORAH

          So far I've just been talking about
          a flirtation because the really
          important thing for you to know...

                    JOHN

          Have you said yet whether you've
          had sex with someone else? Because
          I really am missing most of your
          words. So help me out here..




                                                          100.








                    DEBORAH

          I've been trying to explain that
          for the first ten weeks there was
          almost nothing to ...

                     JOHN

              (sincerely checking but
               wild)
          You still haven't said, right?

                    DEBORAH

          Is this your way of...

                    JOHN

          This is my way of...this is my way
          of asking you whether..
He stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished
future.

                    JOHN (CONT'D)

          Oh man, once I ask it...give me a
          second.
              (several beats then some
               conversational good
               manners for keeping her
               waiting)
          I'm just trying to figure out
          whether there's any way to avoid
          knowing..no, damn
              (quickly closing this
               argument with himself)
          There's not...
              (to her)
          Okay, you're on..real short answer,
          huh? Have you had sex with
          another..

                    DEBORAH

          I know you're very angry?

                    JOHN

              (considering/then
               repressed answer)
          Ahhhh...I'm getting there, yes.

                    DEBORAH

              (softly)
          John?
              (on his look)
          I think if you let me tell you the
          full everything of this we'd be in
          a position to deal with it
          better..because eleven weeks ago
          when...




                                                             101.








                          JOHN

                You don't believe that I miss your
                words..I get three or four
                tops...and then just see your mouth
                moving with nothing coming out and
                then I spin out and there's this
                noise...But there's no way to miss
                a "yes" or "no."

                          DEBORAH

                    (blurts)
                Yes..

                          JOHN

                    (core simple/eight years
                     old)
                Really?

                          DEBORAH

                    (this gets her)
                I made up my mind that I would
                answer every question you had..I'll
                answer anything and everything and
                more.

                          JOHN

                    (perplexed)
                What other questions could there
                be?

                          DEBORAH

                Are you really that much nicer than
                me?

                          JOHN

                Well, you don't set the bar real
                high.
      He get up and starts to exit..

                          DEBORAH

                No. Please, please, please..I
                think if you listen to exactly what
                happened and then do whatever you
                need to...we'll..just let me tell
                you everything..
      The doorbell rings...it's quite late...Deborah wondering
      what's up..she looks out the window.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                Oh, it's just Flor.

153   EXT. STONE CANYON NIGHT..                                  153

      As Flor enters the Clasky House...




                                                             102.








154   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                             154

      Flor sees Evelyn in the living room.

                          EVELYN

                What are you doing here?

                          FLOR

                I want Cristina. I want to talk to
                Mrs. Clasky. I want to quit.

                          EVELYN

                I don't think you can do any of it
                right this minute..

                          FLOR

                Oh, yes..Where's Cristina?

155   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                155

      Deborah can barely look at him...

                          DEBORAH

                ...then, when I was driving back
                tonight after I ended the whole
                yuck thing..I was feeling human.
                I'm done with what's his name..a
                relief... ..and now it can be like
                it never happened and then I
                thought that the only hope was that
                I own that it did happen and that I
                take my medicine here..because if
                I'm walking around with what I did
                and you don't know what I
                did..there is a real limit to how
                close we can be..you're with me and
                I'm this person who has this bad
                secret and we aren't really on the
                same page ever again..so the reason
                I took this chance in telling -- is
                because I want us to be good..I
                want us to be close. I want to
                feel like you're not nuts to be in
                love with me..So what I think is we
                should talk till we pass out ..
                Talk till we're so sick of each
                other that there's nothing left to
                do but take the first step out of
                hell..So please let's not leave
                this room until you've heard and
                said everything..please say, okay..
      She awaits his answer..He has heard barely a few words..

                          JOHN

                What?




                                                             103.








                            DEBORAH

                  John..

                            JOHN

                  I've got to get out of
                  here..because you keep talking.
                      (as she starts to follow
                       him)
                  Stay put!
      She does. Just before he exits.

                            DEBORAH

                  You've got to say something.

                            JOHN

                  You are a terrible wife.
      He exits.

156   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              156

      Evelyn stands in the doorway with Flor..they are looking at
      Cristina and her two friends sleeping together.

                            EVELYN

                  I don't think you want to wake her
                  when you're this upset and the
                  other kids are right there and...
      Flor makes a noise of frustration and retreats from the room.

157   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                               157

      As they arrive at the interior entrance, John comes down the
      stairs just as Flor opens the front door.

                            JOHN

                  Where you going?

                            FLOR

                  I'm leaving....I have finally..

                            JOHN

                  Me too..I'll drive you.

                            FLOR

                  No.

                            JOHN

                  Yes..come on...it's past midnight
                  here.

                            FLOR

                  If you truly don't know why I say
                  "no" let me at last say the reason.
                  At least that will be a relief.
                  Have you no idea that I....




                                                             104.







      Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the
      floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's
      snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball.

      OTHER ANGLE.

      As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it
      and returns.

                           JOHN

                 Look I have to get out of here
                 right now..

                           FLOR

                 Go..
      John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these
      tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                 Goodbye, Chum.
      Another toss and Flor follows John out the door.

      ON CHUM.

      No longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at
      the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor.

158   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                             158

      John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate.

                           JOHN

                     (as decisive as we've seen
                      him)
                 I'm taking you.

                           FLOR

                     (with anger)
                 Why?!?

                           JOHN

                 Because if I don't -- I'll worry
                 about you and I can't handle that
                 right now, okay?
      Flor emits a crooning sound.

                           FLOR

                 Ahhhhh.
                     (stunned and worried)
                 I never made that sound over a man
                 before..




                                                              105.







      Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the
      passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he
      nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she
      catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while
      he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his
      solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes
      sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The
      frustration roiling in her.

                           FLOR (CONT'D)

                 Please!?! Mandilón.

      OTHER ANGLE..

      Deborah watching them...

      HER POV.

      Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous,
      soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.

      CLOSE ON DEBORAH..

      She trembles under the force of imminent justice.

159   INT. JOHN'S CAR - LATE NIGHT                                159

      Two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the
      car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and
      explosive shout...

                           FLOR

                     (a quick and mighty vent)
                 Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!
      For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while..

                           JOHN

                 Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me
                 that word sometime. I can really
                 use it.
      She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the
      anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to
      deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out
      exponentially too forcefully.

                           FLOR

                 I quit this job!
      His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her..

                           JOHN

                 I quit this job!!!!!
      As he turns onto Sunset.




                                                      106.








                    FLOR

          That's the bus stop.

                    JOHN

          I'll take you home.

                    FLOR

          No. Drop me at a bus.

                    JOHN

          Oh, shut up and stop telling me
          what to do.

                    FLOR

          Okay...then let's do something
          besides driving me home where my
          daughter isn't.

                    JOHN

          Okay..we'll do something.

                    FLOR

          And I'm supposed to figure out what
          because I'm a housekeeper and you
          don't have to think.

                    JOHN

          Oh, don't do the class thing,
          man..You don't know where I come
          from.

                    FLOR

          Alright, I know. But I can't be
          responsible no more for making sure
          nothing happens. That's another
          terrible job I quit.

                    JOHN

          What are you talking about? I take
          responsibility for anything within
          a block. You have nothing to worry
          about. That's my job.

                    FLOR

          Excellent. So you're going to
          figure out what we do, right?

                    JOHN

          Yes. Okay. Big man figure out!

                    FLOR

          Stop there.
She points to a mall..He looks at her and pulls in.




                                                              107.








160   EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - LATE NIGHT.                       160

      As she leaves the car and goes into a drug store. John, sober
      faced, looks at Flor making an attractive and zestful beeline
      toward an Hispanic market. This could be where it hits him
      that he's on a date...If so..it's too late to duck..

161   INT. MEXICAN MARKET - LATE NIGHT.                         161

      As Flor enters the market..She calls to the young shop girl
      as Marine medics for morphine.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Maquillaje!

                                                        CUT TO:

      The shop girl directs her to the make-up counter where she
      starts shopping..lip gloss, blush, eye stuff..She starts
      applying it at the check out counter.

162   EXT. OUTDOOR MALL - LATE NIGHT                            162

      As she runs back to the car.

163   INT. JOHN'S VEHICLE -                                     163

      As she enters, there is a fury to her which he almost
      matches.

                          FLOR

                This is me when I'm not working..
                You have never seen me!

                          JOHN

                Well, you look familiar.

                            FLOR

                So,
                    (parodying him)
                "man," where we heading?

                          JOHN

                I don't think I can handle public..

                          FLOR

                Yes, no...lots of people right now
                is..

                            JOHN

                I know.

                          FLOR

                You were going to figure this out!

                            JOHN

                My place!




                                                                108.








164   INT. JOHN'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT...                           164

      As they enter the main restaurant...

                            FLOR

                  I've never seen your place. Very
                  perfect.
      He heads for the kitchen.

                            JOHN

                  I'm going to cook, Beautiful.
                      (on a dime correction)
                  I'm going to cook beautifully.

                            FLOR

                  Hey..please..
      He turns.

                            FLOR (CONT'D)

                  We both were not normal because we
                  are angry and we act like we are
                  angry with each other and we are
                  not..I am not. I am glad to be with
                  you. It feels comfortable to be
                  with you. If I just left the job
                  and never spoke with you it would
                  have been sin. You understand?

                            JOHN

                  Ummmmmmmmm...Yes.
      He stands next to her and, for want of a better physical
      expression, pats her on her back..She eyes him, almost
      critical about the lame extent of his aggression....He can't
      quite look at her...He pats her again..

      REAR ANGLE..THE PAT ON THE BACK.

      The pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his
      hand..she responds just a bit..

                            JOHN (CONT'D)

                  I think I'm inventing a horrible
                  new way of making out..

                            FLOR

                  Not so horrible.....
      His hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they
      both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the
      market. His hand squeezes her shoulder.

                            JOHN

                  My hand is the only sane part of my
                  body..every other part wants to
                  jump off a cliff.




                                                             109.








                           FLOR

                     (digging this/almost
                      growing a sense of humor)
                If the other hand could cheer up,
                you could lift me up and carry me
                off.
      He laughs. He takes his hand from around her. It is a bit
      awkward.

                          JOHN

                I don't know how to handle that
                one. I think I already broke my
                record for smooth.

                          FLOR

                I don't understand.

                          JOHN

                It's me. I'm not making sense. But
                I can get you fed.
      He goes to the kitchen. She begins to explore a little. She
      goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a CD player. She digs
      in her purse and takes out a CD.

165   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT                             165

      As John starts cooking up a storm...there is some velocity to
      his cooking...he still seethes. Then reacts as Spanish Music
      starts to play. He clears his throat as if he must make a
      speech. Then does so again..some vocal spasm paying tribute
      to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.

166   INT. RESTAURANT - DINING AREA - NIGHT...                    166

      Flor is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables.

167   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT...                          167

      He is cooking..He is talking to himself.

                           JOHN

                Nothing to be nervous about. You
                are not on a date...
                    (calls out)
                Hey, Flor?

                             FLOR'S VOICE (O.S.)

                Yes, John.

                          JOHN

                What are you doing?
      She enters the room...dancing a bit..




                                                       110.








                    FLOR

          Just lighting candles and picking
          music.
              (notices his cooking)
          Oooh.
She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet
dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish. He is uncomfortable
anew. The nervousness mounting.

                    JOHN

          You want a drink?
She considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not
realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally
aware she has not answered and looks at her..

                     JOHN (CONT'D)

          Huh?
She regards him levelly..then makes her decision.

                     FLOR

          No.
He gets out a bottle of vodka.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          I, uh...don't think you should
          either.

                    JOHN

          Then excuse me, because if I had
          the equipment I'd inject the vodka.
He starts to pour.

                    FLOR

          Wait!
              (he stops)
          I think it is so important that we
          are each clear-headed.
He looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor
beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some
time.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          It is very good that you did not
          ask, "why?"

                    JOHN

              (quietly)
          Keep things real, right?

                    FLOR

              (impressed)
          I wouldn't have put it so well.




                                                                111.








168   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - HALF HOUR LATER - NIGHT           168

      They sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the
      greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man.

                          FLOR

                I will remember every
                taste..forever.

                          JOHN

                Tell you the truth..I wanted a shot
                at cooking for you.
                    (shy/his heart)
                I'm very glad you liked it.

                          FLOR

                It's something watching you.
      He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a
      very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man.

                          JOHN

                Well, if it's anything at your end
                imagine over here...scratch
                that..the last thing you want to
                hear is somebody going off on your
                looks.

                          FLOR

                Don't be crazy. Tell me every
                detail.

                          JOHN

                Okay, Flor, yes I will...They
                should name a gender after
                you..Looking at you doesn't do
                it..Staring is the only thing that
                makes sense..and trying not to
                blink so you don't miss anything.
      She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in
      so doing loses his courage..He looks down at his
      hands..shyness again belting him a good one..Still looking
      down.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                Look..forgive me..I'm.....It's just
                that you are drop-dead, crazy-
                gorgeous..so much so that I am
                really considering looking at you
                again before we finish up here.

                          FLOR

                Soon, please.
      And now he looks at her.

      CLOSE ON FLOR..





                                                               112.







      Utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before
      being swept away.

                             FLOR (CONT'D)

                   Right now....immediately..we have
                   to dance or kiss.
      He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at
      weighing the two options and then:

      HIS POV..

      Her face..

                             JOHN

                   No contest.
      They kiss.

                             FLOR

                   You sure you're not Mexican.

                             JOHN

                       (smiling/he likes this)
                   What do you mean?

                             FLOR

                   I meant you talk like a Spanish
                   song.

                             JOHN

                   You kiss like a Spanish fly..
                       (on her confusion)
                   Joking around. I don't know what
                   I'm talking about...

                             FLOR

                   Yes you do.
      She breaks and heads for the dining room. John has a moment
      to consider.. He does not have his wits about him..a
      condition every bit as fearsome as liberating.

169   INT. RESTAURANT - DINING ROOM.                             169

      As Flor rummages for another CD, enjoying every minute. She
      places the disk in the player and exits.

170   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN.                                   170

      As she returns...

                             FLOR (CONT'D)

                   This song...You see what a good
                   thing to tell you how you talk like
                   a Mexican song.




                                                          113.







She begins to translate the lyrics.

                     FLOR (CONT'D)

          When I kiss you, entire oceans rush
          through my veins..
              (he is wildly
                uncomfortable)
          Gardens of flowers blossom in my
          body.
He starts to make a comic gesture of awkwardness to get past
the event..she shakes her head at him..driving the words --
pointing emphatically..she will not have her poetry laughed
at..

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          And you wander along my fertile
          soil, picking its ripe fruit..A
          nightingale undresses on my
          tongue..And under its wings..
He laughs. She stops cold. Looks down..though just seconds
long, this still constitutes the first depression of her
life.

                    JOHN

          I'm sorry. I don't know what I just
          took out of you but tell me how to
          get it back in there..I'm sorry.
          Flor..I'm sorry.

CLOSE ON HER..

The downcast eyes rise to see him..

                    FLOR

          Then respect this.
He looks at her...they kiss..It is a kiss without an author.
God at the controls. They break. There is a beat then..

                    JOHN

          Here's something I never asked
          anyone..Did nightingales undress on
          your tongue?
Flor looks at him with enormous warmth. Her arms looped
around his neck..aware of the music.

                    FLOR

          Did they on yours?

                    JOHN

              (a long beat of
               reflection/then sincere
               and surprised)
          Yeah...




                                                                114.








171   EXT. RESTAURANT - SOME TIME LATER                           171

      Moving camera...the small house turned restaurant..little
      flickers of light...

                          NARRATOR

                My mother never told me the details
                of her visit to the restaurant.
                But she often referred to it as the
                greatest conversation of her life.

172   INT. RESTAURANT - VERY LATE NIGHT...                        172

      They are lying post coitally in each other's arms on a sofa
      just inside the dining room..They are covered by a table
      cloth. They hold hands above the cover...each private but
      still somehow in contact.

                          FLOR

                Oh, Johnny, why is everything so
                damn confusing?

                          JOHN

                Culpa.
      Flor's pleasure zone is rocked. She smiles at his first
      Spanish word. She is wrestling with large feelings of
      pleasure and large ominous thoughts.

                          FLOR

                    (a beat)
                Is your mind racing?

                          JOHN

                I would say my mind has
                evaporated...but that there are
                remnants still standing waiting to
                fall. It feels pretty good.

                          FLOR

                Like happy?

                          JOHN

                Like happy.

                          FLOR

                You think that will last?

                          JOHN

                It's already gone.

                          FLOR

                I understand what you mean.

                          JOHN

                I don't understand what I mean.




                                                       115.








                    FLOR

          That it's getting late. That
          responsibilities have entered your
          brain. Don't hide that from me.
          And really, one large reason we are
          here is because you respect me as a
          mother and I respect you as a
          father..
He is looking at her...she is disconcerted.

                    JOHN

          You're a great and wild mother.

                    FLOR

          You are a beautiful father.
She looks at him..they kiss...tenderness..heat...intimacy.

                    FLOR (CONT'D)

          When Cristina was young, I would
          say I want to take any man who
          wants me to the park and I will
          tell whether I want him from the
          way he is with Cristina. I wish
          you had been in the park then.
              (a beat)
          Any reaction?
John considering and then the answer comes to him.

                       JOHN

          Exactly!..

                    FLOR

          You know, I always think about when
          you...Oh, there's no point. I talk
          too much...
              (a bit of emotion)
          ...because I don't know if we ever
          talk again.

                    JOHN

          Hey, hey..How do you get there?
          Wait.

                    FLOR

          Yes you do. Be honest.

                    JOHN

          I'm being honest.
              (indicates their bodies)
          Look at us - I think I call it
          honesty.




                                                             116.








                          FLOR

                What are we going to do -- go home,
                let our hearts go back in our
                bodies, see each other a few more
                times. Make a tragedy out of us..
      She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a
      small cooing sound.

                          FLOR (CONT'D)

                Ahhhhhhh.
                    (sudden energy)
                There are some mistakes you cannot
                risk when you have kids...Please,
                are you ready to go?

                            JOHN

                     (urgently)
                No. I'm not. No.
                     (then)
                Stay put for a second. Stay here.
                Once our feet touch that floor, I'm
                going to get too many brain cells
                back. So don't be in such a hurry.
                That floor, Flor, is going to eat
                us alive.
                     (she settles back/he is
                      energized)
                So you think it was a mistake up to
                now.
                     (she nods "yes")
                That's rough.
      She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot
      touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him.

                          FLOR

                The mistake....I love it.

173   INT. CLASKY HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT.          173

      Deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of
      her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as
      she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of
      Stone Canyon. In her current shape she would give pause to a
      staff worker at Promises..a shock victim walking through the
      rubble after the bomb has dropped. Deborah's voice is
      scratchy when she speaks.

                          DEBORAH

                Tell me again why I can't call him
                on the cell.

                          EVELYN

                Besides that he turned it off?

                          DEBORAH

                Yes.




                                                       117.








                    EVELYN

          Forty messages start to look needy.

                    DEBORAH

          Mother, you're enjoying this.

                    EVELYN

          No..Definitely not in the way you
          think.

                    DEBORAH

              (staggered)
          You are enjoying it?!?

                    EVELYN

              (rising/honest)
          I am enjoying actually being of use
          to my daughter. I am enjoying the
          fact that I really know how to
          advise you and the miracle that you
          are so deeply disoriented that you
          are gobbling up everything I say.
Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a
somewhat new way..as if Evelyn were an actual person instead
of an upsetting extension of herself.

                    DEBORAH

              (vulnerable)
          There's one thing I'd like to say
          to you about you and me.

                    EVELYN

          You don't have to.

                       DEBORAH

          I want to.

                       EVELYN

          Okay.

                    DEBORAH

              (quite vulnerable and
               appealing)
          You were an alcoholic and wildly
          promiscuous woman during my
          formative years so that I am in
          this fix because of you. It is your
          fault. I just needed..
              (gestures heart to heart)
          ..that moment for us.

                    EVELYN

          You have a solid point, dear. But
          right now the lessons of my life
          are coming in handy for you.




                                                        118.








                    DEBORAH

          There's a car coming....
Evelyn moves to her.

                    DEBORAH (CONT'D)

          It's him...he's got to tell me
          everything..
Evelyn shakes her head "no."

                       DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                 (wild-eyed)
          Yes!

                    EVELYN

          Do you know that right now you are
          your own worst enemy..that you
          can't trust one thought in your
          brain?

                       DEBORAH

          Duh.

                    EVELYN

          Then trust me and only allow
          yourself to say one thing to
          him..One thing..."I'm so glad
          you're back."

                       DEBORAH

          Huh?

                       EVELYN

          Yes.

                    DEBORAH

              (babbling)
          But I've got to know whether he
          touched her - where he touched her -
          how he touched her - if they broke
          a sweat --- what they said - who
          made the first move - how they left
          it -- if anyone loves anyone or has
          an intention of making contact in
          the future - what she wore - how he
          felt afterwards - whether anyone
          mentioned me..
              (a wail)
          ..whether they held hands when they
          left..
The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from
downstairs.




                                                             119.








                          EVELYN

                Just those words I said. If you
                want a prayer of coming out of
                this.

                          DEBORAH

                I know you're right..But..

                            EVELYN

                But what?

                          DEBORAH

                    (a small voice)
                I forgot the sentence you said I
                should say.

                          EVELYN

                "I'm so glad you're back."

                          DEBORAH

                Okay..do I have to wait here?

                          EVELYN

                No..he may not come up here..go to
                him.

                          DEBORAH

                Why wouldn't he come up here?

                            EVELYN

                Just go.

                          DEBORAH

                Do I need a little makeup?

                          EVELYN

                You need a hose but you don't have
                the time. It's fine that you look
                like that. It's genuine..You can
                use genuine.

                          DEBORAH

                Thank you, mom.
      She takes a breath exits...

174   INT. STAIRWELL                                           174

      She pauses at the top of the stairs..a breath..then unable to
      help herself runs down them at breakneck speed.

175   INT. DOWNSTAIRS..                                        175

      John turning a light on when Deborah bursts into the room.




                                                               120.








                          DEBORAH

                I'm so glad to see you
                    (correcting self)
                ..that you're back.
      John looks up at her - not knowing what to say...he is
      thrown. His demeanor has changed...deeper..serious..

                          JOHN

                It's late, Deborah.
      The wrong words start to form..she stops herself..

                          DEBORAH

                Well, I just wanted to say.. what I
                said..
      She is on the stairway..he turns to go in the opposite
      direction.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                    (way too loud)
                Uhhhh..
      He turns back to her...she stops herself from straying into
      untried words but gestures whether he is coming upstairs to
      bed.

                          JOHN

                    (a beat then)
                I can't sleep upstairs with you..
                Just can't for now.
      This rocks her..panicked she grabs at her life preserver.

                          DEBORAH

                I'm just so glad you're back.
      Deborah's suddenly classy demeanor provides just the barest
      of footings for them...He looks at her directly for the first
      time since she told him.

                          JOHN

                Yeah..okay.
      She nods..then goes back up the stairs..

176   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT                                 176

      Evelyn, who has been standing close to the doorway, stands
      clear to let her enter. As Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable
      - her breath racing.

                          DEBORAH

                I am literally choking on unsaid
                words..seriously. If this were a
                restaurant ten people would have
                their knuckles in my sternum.




                                                             121.








                          EVELYN

                The fact that you didn't just make
                things worse should fill you with
                hope..
      In her current state, she has to process that one..and does.
      Her breath slows.

177   INT. MAID'S ROOM - NIGHT...                              177

      The first time we've seen this room since Flor was working
      the sewing machine...John enters. He is down, longing and
      finality make for a brutal cocktail..He rubs his head and
      sits near the sewing machine..He glances over and sees Flor's
      Spanish/English dictionary..There is a knock on the door.

                          JOHN

                Deb, I'm done tonight. I don't
                think we can jam anything else in.

                          BERNICE'S VOICE

                It's me, Dad.
      He springs from the bed and opens the door.

                          JOHN

                What's up, honey?

                          BERNICE

                Just thought I'd check that you
                were back and okay and all.

                          JOHN

                    (feigning innocence)
                Because?

                          BERNICE

                Mom was crying for six hours
                straight and Grandma was in with
                her all that time mostly saying,
                "he'll be back..he'll be back."
                I've got to get back to Georgie.

                          JOHN

                I just hate that you had that kind
                of a night.

                          BERNICE

                It's good for me to worry about
                something that really matters
                instead of the stupid stuff that's
                usually on my mind...

                          JOHN

                Like?




                                                               122.








                              BERNICE

                       (a big grin)
                   Surviving.

                             JOHN

                   You're fantastic, Bernie...I love
                   you.

                             BERNICE

                   It's a slant...
                       (pause then)
                   Hey..I know there's a lot you went
                   through but I knew all along that
                   Grandma was right about you coming
                   back..I mean totally knew it so I
                   wasn't that worried. But still I...
                       (some emotion out of
                        hiding)
                   I really appreciate it, Dad.
                   Thanks....Stop staring at me..what?
                   You don't know what to say?

                             JOHN

                   Right. I don't know what to say.

                             BERNICE

                   Just what you taught me..You're
                   welcome.

                             JOHN

                   You're welcome.
      They kiss.

178   EXT. STONE CANYON -     MORNING.                           178

      Flor purposefully walking up the hill..

179   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                   179

      As Flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once
      in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming
      in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on
      interview day.

180   EXT. CLASKY POOL - DAY.                                    180

      Evelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool..Cristina,
      wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading...

                             CRISTINA

                   Hey, mom...Is it okay if we don't
                   leave right away?
      The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the
      situation and gets out of the pool..Flor is awkward..no idea
      how to handle this...so she goes direct.




                                                       123.








                     FLOR

          No...
              (as Cristina begins to
                protest)
          No..and we must say "goodbye." I
          don't work here anymore.
She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to
embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go
nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but
it is said with total calm.

                    GEORGIE

          Do I have to get out?

                    FLOR

          No, Georgie..Stay. I think you are
          a wonderful boy..be good..like you
          are. There are no monsters.

                    GEORGIE

          Thanks..thanks. Okay.
Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted
Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three
word proddings in Spanish.

                    BERNICE

              (severely to Georgie)
          I can't believe you didn't get out.

                       GEORGIE

          Flor said.

                    BERNICE

              (to Flor)
          I don't want to get you wet.

                    FLOR

          Get me wet.

                    BERNICE

              (rushing to hug her)
          Thanks.
Bernice hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina..

                    EVELYN

          You...are...a...trip.

                    FLOR

              (to Bernice)
          You're a beauty. Amazing girl.




                                                                124.







      Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over
      the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal
      human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be
      recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom
      window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as
      Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina.

                          BERNICE

                My last chance to have some of you
                rub off on me..
                    (Cristina doesn't
                     understand)
                I'm sorry you're so sad but this
                could have been so much worse.

                             CRISTINA

                       (from her depths)
                How?
      And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but
      Flor manages..

                          EVELYN

                    (to Cristina)
                Why don't you run upstairs and say
                goodbye to Deborah?
      Flor flashes a look of thanks.

                          FLOR

                I'll be in front.
      Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks
      toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom..

                          DEBORAH

                Please come see me.
      And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances
      up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly
      hears the beginning of their exchange

                          DEBORAH'S VOICE

                It's okay, honey..we'll see each
                other at school..I'm going to keep
                an eye on you..I will.
      Flor enters the house...

181   INT. KITCHEN - DAY.                                         181

      She stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head
      to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as
      she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper
      landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her
      things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off
      to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot.




                                                             125.








                          DEBORAH

                Please stick your head in here for
                a minute.
      Flor nods and starts up the stairs...

182   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                                   182

      Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside..then
      closes it.

                          DEBORAH

                What's with avoiding me, am I this
                horrible person?
      As Flor just looks at her.

                          DEBORAH (CONT'D)

                I know. It's a ridiculous question
                but sometimes I'm ridi...

                          FLOR

                No. It's a good question. A fine
                question. Complicated.
                    (beat then)
                I was just thinking to answer.

                           DEBORAH

                Oh stop.   Come on. Weren't we
                close?

                            FLOR

                      (like a shot)
                No.

                          DEBORAH

                    (truly hurt)
                Well, I'm very, very disappointed
                to hear that. It makes me feel like
                a fool.

                          FLOR

                    (compassion forces a
                     crumb)
                We weren't close..but we were
                connected...in a bad way.

                          DEBORAH

                    (strangely soothed)
                You know something, I think we're
                saying the same thing...Look as
                long as we're doing closure..What
                did you and my husband, John, do
                last night?
      Flor pauses for less of a beat than we would have imagined.

                          FLOR

                I can only tell you what I did.




                                                               126.








                          DEBORAH

                That will be sufficient.

                          FLOR

                    (these are tender
                     feelings)
                I became sure of what an incredibly
                lucky woman you are and I must make
                myself not envy you which is hard.
                No, it's not hard. It's impossible.
                Now please..I am exhausted.

                          DEBORAH

                Same here - believe me.
      Deborah would hug..but it's only an eighth of a gesture
      because Flor has turned to exit, calling for her daughter to
      hurry as she goes.

                          FLOR

                Cristina, apúrate.

183   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                    183

      As she exits the house and moves to the gate where she
      punches in the exit code...

      ANGLE ON GATE

      As it swings open to reveal John...

184   EXT. STREET - DAY.                                         184

      As she moves alongside him and the gate closes behind her.

                          JOHN

                I was hanging out here waiting.
                Can't give you guys a lift?
      Flor shakes her head "no." She looks away for a beat so the
      next thing she does is a considered action. She leans forward
      and kisses him on the lips. John looks at her.

                          JOHN (CONT'D)

                This is killer.
                    (on her confusion)
                Incredibly hard.

                          FLOR

                Yes, Cari..
      The gate opens and a sniffling Cristina is holding an armful
      of loot.

                          JOHN

                    (reading Flor)
                Let her have it..party favors.




                                                              127.







      She nods..bites back some emotion and turns from him.

                             FLOR

                Cristina..

                          CRISTINA

                Goodbye, Mr. Clasky..I am very
                sorry we will not see each other as
                frequently.
      She offers her hand, which John shakes while patting her on
      the back.

                             FLOR

                Yes.
      They turn and begin walking down the street.

      SHOT - STONE CANYON

      The women walking toward camera, John briefly in the
      background...As they begin their walk Flor begins talking in
      Spanish.

                          NARRATOR

                The first minute we were alone, my
                mother told me that I would no
                longer go to the private school.

                          CRISTINA

                No. No..You can't. I won't be able
                to forgive you..It will be the end.
                I won't let you.
      And then Cristina moves her hysterics to Spanish as she stops
      walking and her mother takes her hand and pulls her along
      with enormous dedication. CAMERA BEGINS A PULL BACK.
      Cristina dropping presents..picking them up..one of them left
      by the wayside..People noticing..Cristina's conduct violating
      tacit zoning laws.

      CLOSER SHOT..

      So we can see their faces in the struggle.

185   EXT. BUS STOP..                                            185

      As they wait...Flor talks sharply to Cristina to control
      herself.

                          NARRATOR

                My mother changed our lives once
                more. This time because she saw in
                me, to her great alarm, a character
                flaw of some size. She has taught
                me to be a watch dog of my
                character, to control my ambition.
                I am not quite there.




                                                              128.







      One last yelp from Cristina as the bus arrives.

186   INT. BUS - DAY.                                           186

      Almost empty - it's Saturday. Mother and daughter sit
      together by the giant window in the center of the bus.
      Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own heartbreak
      with stoic dignity. The girl is becoming less inconsolable
      and more in need of mothering.

                           NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                For that reason should you choose
                to grant me your scholarship my
                mother, at my request, will be
                relocating to the New York
                Metropolitan Area so that she can
                stay close during my time at
                Princeton.
      Cristina moves closer to Flor, who senses it immediately and
      wraps her in her arms.. kisses her head.

                          NARRATOR (CONT'D)

                I hope my essay has done her
                justice. I love her with all my
                heart.

                                                        FADE OUT.
State and Main

 


   FADE IN:

   EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

   Ann is walking down the street.  The firedog runs out of the
   firehouse, she gives the dog a biscuit, and pats him on the
   head. 

   The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee.  Ann hands him
   a poster.

   EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - DAY

   Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street
   when they hear a beeping and stop.

   As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group
   nods in that direction.

                       MORRIS
             You hear that?

                       SPUD
             Yes, I hear it.

                       MORRIS
             Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half
             an-hour, get across the street
             yesterday.

                       SPUD
             I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank
             of the building.  Said, "What are you
             doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the
             'leven o'clock crossing..."

   As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and
   bounces in the pothole.

                       MORRIS
             Y'wanna fix something, you should fix
             the pothole.  Yessir, they should be
             trussed up, thrown off some high
             building.

   DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join
   them.

                       DOUG
             Who's that?

                       MORRIS
             Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand
             dollars, a new traffic light, you could
             grow old, paint your house before it
             lets you cross the street, and then, not
             fix the pothole.

                       SPUD
             What was wrong with the old traffic
             light?

   INT. COFFEE CORNER - DAY

   They enter the Coffee Corner.  Carla is serving the folk, and
   Jack the owner is behind the counter.

                       DOUG
             I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what
             was wrong with it.  And what was wrong
             with it was it was behind the times. 
             Now: You want to bring business into
             this town?  You have to plan for a
             Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at
             the moment, no...

                       ANN
             Morning, darling.

                       DOUG
             Morning.

                       CARLA
             Hi, Annie.

   Ann hands Carla a poster.

                       ANN
             Morning, Carla.

   Doug and the two codgers move to a table by the window where
   Carla, the nubile waitress, brings them coffee.  Ann talks to
   a woman at the counter.

                       MORRIS
             ...the damn thing...

                       SPUD
             No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a
             lot of people are pretty upset...

                       DOUG
             They are, yes.  I'm sure they are...

                       WOMAN AT COUNTER
             Annie, I'm going to be a lil' late for
             the rehearsal, tonight.

                       ANN
             S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?

                       DOUG
             ...I'm sure that people are upset...

                       MAUDE
             I know 'em, I don't know what order they
             come in...

                       ANN
             We'll work it out.

                       JACK 
             What're they talking about?

                       ANN
             Traffic light.

                       JACK
             Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's
             thing.  That's his thing, fine.

                       DOUG
             Thank you, Jack, and...

                       JACK
             But we got to talk about the pothole.

                       DOUG
             Jack...

                       JACK
             A public office is a public trust...
             This is why this is America.  Question
             is: who owns the street.

   Outside the front booth, on the street, the airport van
   cruises by.
			
   
			EXT. STATE AND MAIN - DAY

   As they walk out we hear a high pitched beeping sound at the
   traffic light.  We see DOC WILSON crossing the street,
   holding his doctor's bag.  An ELDERLY MAN approaches Doc at
   the crossing.  As Walt and Bill walk, the airport van follows
   them.

                       TOWNSMAN
             Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? 
             I'm not sure that they work.

                       DOC WILSON
             Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't
             hear me complain... come by th'office,
             end of th'afternoon.

                       TOWNSMAN
             Thanks, Doc...

                       BILL
             This is your movie, this is small town
             America.

                       WALT
             Town in New Hampshire was small town
             America, too.  Forty thousand dollars a
             day, to shoot on the street.  And then
             they kicked us out...

   They stop in front of a rack of fifty "factory seconds."

   Black and red hunting jackets, in front of the sporting goods
   store.  The sign reads "FACTORY SECONDS, FIVE DOLLARS."

                       BILL
             A jacket for five dollars... I can buy
             this town for fifty bucks.

                       WALT
             You told me that about the last town.

                       BILL
             Yeah, but they never made a movie here.

                       WALT
             I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding...

                       BILL
             ...why am I here?

                       WALT
             What, what, what, what do they got that
             can pass for the Old Mill?

   Bill shows Walt a brochure from Waterford, which shows a
   picture of the Old Mill.  Walt reads.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             "The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and
             long a tourist attraction..." Wake up
             Uberto

   ANGLE:

   INT. THE AIRPORT VAN - CONTINUOUS

   UBERTO is asleep.  Bill wakes him up.

                       UBERTO
             Where are we?

                       WALT
             Givvem a cigarette...

   Uberto comes out of the car and squints around.

                       UBERTO
             ...they ship our Old Mill from New
             Hampshire?

                       BILL
             They're holding our Old Mill for ransom.

                       UBERTO
             We build it?

                       BILL
             We don't have to build it.

   He shows Uberto the brochure.

                       UBERTO
             We build the fire hut?

   Walt shows Uberto the Firehouse.  Uberto looks through the
   viewfinder.

                       UBERTO (CONT'D)
             We have to lose the window.

                       WALT
             ...we can't lose the wind...

                       UBERTO
                 (pulling out storyboards)
             Then I can't do this shot... you wants
             me to push in -- I can't push in through
             the window... we go back to New
             Hampshire?

                       BILL
             NO, we can't ever go back to New
             Hampshire.

   A pick-up truck with two calves in it stops, the driver seen
   from the back is a farmer smoking a pipe.

                       WALT
             NO, we're gonna stay here.  This is what
             my people died for.  The right to make a
             movie in this town.

   INT. TAVERN INN LOBBY - DAY

   A desk clerk, SCOTT, looks up.  Behind the desk a display of
   several souvenir plates, "Souvenir of Waterford, VT", with a
   picture of the Old Mill on them.  Walt picks one up and hands
   it to Bill.

                       SCOTT
             May I help you?

                       WALT
                 (followed Bill)
             I want to talk to the manager.

   Walt talks into his cell phone as he talks to Scott.

                       SCOTT
             Would you like a room?

                       BILL
             Na, we wanna rent the whole hotel.

                       WALT
                 (into phone)
             Hello, Tracy, we gotta new town. 
             We're...where are we?

   BEAT.  Bill looks around, sees a sign on a desk.  Consults
   his tourist folder.  As they talk they walk into deserted
   ballroom and play shuffleboard and archery.

                       BILL
                 (carrying Waterford plate)
             Waterford, Vermont.

                       WALT
             ...you got to get me that street for
             nothing...

                       BILL
             I will.

                       WALT
                 (into phone)
             Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it? 
             That's where it is...

   Walt carries the shuffleboard stick over his shoulder.

   INT. WALT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

   Walt is talking on a cellphone.  A male P.A. is bringing in
   bags of equipment.  Bill is still sitting perched on a desk,
   typing into his computer.  Uberto is sitting on a couch,
   smoking.

   We see the shuffleboard stick on the desk, and the Old Mill
   plate on the wall.

                       WALT
                 (to phone)
             Because, because...we don't have to
             build an Old Mill.  They have an Old
             Mill.  Yeah.  It's on a stream -- that's
             where you put a mill.

                       BILL
             ...they run on water.

                       WALT
                 (to phone)
             Now: I'm looking at the...

   He gestures for Bill who hands him the storyboards.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             I've got scene twelve...
                 (to Carla)
             Shouldn't you be in school?

                       CARLA
             It's night.

                       WALT
                 (to phone as he shows the Old
                  Mill storyboards to camera)
             Scene twelve...arrival at the mill.

   ANGLE

   Scott enters.

                       SCOTT
             Mr. Price, Mr. Price...?
                 (he hands Walt flowers)

                       BILL

   Carla knocks on the door to the back room, voices from
   inside.  Outside, on two chairs, the MAYOR, GEORGE BAILEY, a
   man in his fifties, and JOE WHITE, the writer, dressed in an
   army field jacket and jeans, waiting to be admitted.

   Joe is reading an old "Welcome to Waterford" tourist folder. 
   The door to the room opens, and Joe stands, looks inside,
   squints.  Takes off his reading glasses and puts on another

   Inside the room, production boards being carried in,
   blackboards, schedules taped to the wall, sketches of Main
   Street, a large "days till shoot...4" sign.  The Old Mill
   plate is on the desk.

   The PRODUCTION DESIGNER is bent over a worktable, he holds a
   compass and refers to blueprints and a scale model of the
   Firehouse and the Old Mill, which are on the table.

   Walt is holding glossy photographs, and leafs through them as
   the Production Designer talks.  They leaf through
   storyboards.

   We see that Walt is leafing through glossy photos of horses. 
   Walt has shuffleboard stick over his shoulder.

             That could be.

   An old man, the BELLHOP, is sitting by the front door, eating
   his lunch out of an old galvanized tin lunch bucket.  He puts
   it down, and gets up and takes the bags.

             Chuckie...

   is wandering around the lobby.  The First A.D. comes up to

   Carla, who has been waiting for the order to be prepared,
   takes it from her father, starts out the door.

             That's what they said about Warner

             I want to tell you something, Ann: you
             stay soft all your life, people despise
             you;
             it awakens Avarice in them, they take
             advantage of you, and that's Human
             Nature.

   She starts to exit the Coffee Corner.  Jack picks up a copy

                       ANN
             Mmm.

                       JOE
             Cause, cause, it's...it's the simple
             things that...

             Yes...

                       JOE
             ...that.

   Doug walks up.

                       DOUG
             Waal, there you are, and Have I Got Some
             News for you...

                       ANN
             Doug, this is Joe White, and this is,
             this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...

                       JOE
             Sa pleasure.

                       DOUG
             Guess who is THIS CLOSE to a nomination
             to State Senate...which is this close to
             one stop from Congress!

                       ANN
             ...who...?

                       JOE
             Well, I guess I'll...get down to the
             station.  It was lovely meeting...

                       ANN
             Mister White is...

   Doug, as he takes Ann toward the door.

                       DOUG
             Nice meeting you...they were, let me
             tell you, they were a bit coy at first,
             I told them: Look: the people are tired,
             they're going to vote their pocketbook,
             yes, but...

   Joe walks off and exchanges glances with Ann, who lingers
   behind.  She pushes the porch swing and exits.  As it swings,
   Joe watches.



   INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

   Joe enters with his bag.  He stands looking at the long
   poster reading: "Waterford, Home of the Huskies - Division
   Champions - 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1976."

   BEAT.  Joe is looking at the banner when the old
   stationmaster enters.

                       JOE
             What happened in 1973?

   BEAT.  The stationmaster looks around, and leans in to Joe,
   confidentially.

   The DOOR opens.  It is Walt.  The stationmaster retreats. 
   Walt comes forward.

                       WALT
             Don't run off.  Don't run off, we need
             you.  You know why?  You're why we're
             here.  Your script is why we're here...
                 (of bag)
             Gimme that.  Big deal.  We fight a
             little bit? 
             You show me a family that doesn't.  But
             we got something special.  What is it? 
             We're here to make a movie.  Can't use
             the Old Mill.  Well, that happens.  What
             you got to do, you find the essence -
             what was it, that brought us here.  It
             wasn't a building, Joe, it was an idea. 
             It was an essence - what is the essence
             of your story?  Joe?

   PAUSE

                       JOE
             It's about a man who gets a second
             chance.

                       WALT
             Then, you write that.  And then this is
             our second chance.  That's why we're
             here.

   PAUSE

                       JOE
             I want to make a good film.

                       WALT
             I know you do.

                       JOE
             And maybe it will be a better movie
             without the old mill, I...

                       WALT
             Hey, it's with the G-ds.  We don't have
             the money, we have to write it out.  The
             best or not.
                 (shrugs)
             And that's a lesson.  You get your
             typewriter yet?

                       JOE
             Um, no.

   Walt picks up a cell phone, dials.  Lights of train go by
   outside.  Stationmaster enters and calls the train.

                       WALT
                 (into phone)
             Grace, get on the other phone.  Call
             that girl: well, call her, and have
             whatsername send up some nosh...what do
             you like to drink...?

                       JOE
             I don't drink.

                       WALT
             Did my matzohs come?  Get some for
             everybody.
                 (into phone)
             Thank you.
                 (hangs up)
             Lemme tell you about my first movie...

   EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

   The production assistant is stapling a casting notice for
   "The Old Mill" half over the notice of the amateur
   theatricals poster.  Doug shows up, looks in the window. 
   Looks at poster, takes it down, looks around.

   ANGLE ON

   The park bench.  Ann, her feet up on the old typewriter, is
   sitting, reading the script.  Doug comes up.

                       DOUG
             What, what what are you doing here?

                       ANN
             Yes, that's right.

                       DOUG
             Look at this.  Do you know what they're
             offering?  Look at this.  They treat us
             like we're their backyard.  Do you know
             what they're offering for three days to
             close down Main Street?

                       ANN
             What are they offering?

                       DOUG
             Ten thousand dollars.

                       ANN
             That's so beautiful...

                       DOUG
             I beg your pardon?

   Ann gestures at the script.

                       ANN
             "The mill grinds the grain, but the
             grain is not destroyed.  Although it is
             altered..."

                       DOUG
             Sure, but... ten thousand dollars.  Do
             you know what they... this movie is
             budgeted at fifty million dol...they're
             coming up here, offer us a meal...

   INT. MAYOR'S HOME - DAY

   The Mayor's Wife comes into the room.  Her hands are full of
   lists, giving instructions to a handyman.

                       SHERRY (MAYOR'S WIFE)
             The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...

                       MAYOR
             ...not the Lazyboy...

   Cal, the policeman, enters, carrying an old spinning wheel.

                       CAL
             Hi, Sherry...

                       SHERRY
             ...put it in the living room.  And we
             have thirteen at the table.

                       MAYOR
             ...we don't have thirteen at table...

                       SHERRY
             Bob Barrenger, Claire Wellesley, the
             director...

                       MAYOR
             Waal, then, invite someone else, then...

                       SHERRY
             I don't want to invite someone else
             because this is the most exclusive...

                       MAYOR
             Waal, then, you know, you do whatever
             would make you happy.  Sher.  This is
             your party, and whatever...

   Doug enters.  Cal exits carrying a pinball machine.

                       CAL
             Hi Doug.

                       DOUG
             Cal.  I want a city council meeting.

                       MAYOR
             ...little woman has gone crazy about our
             dinner party... City Council?  What's
             the trouble?

                       DOUG
             Main Street.

                       MAYOR
                 (sighs)
             Doug, the traffic light...

                       DOUG
             Fuck the traffic light.  I'm talking
             about three percent of the adjusted
             gross of a Major Motion Picture.

             Mornin', Annie...

   Postman exits.

             In fact, in fact, in fact, I'm not sure
             if I'm giving them a second chance, or
             they're giving it to me.  That's the

             You'd know better'n me.

             "The Old Mill" when I don't have an old
             mill?

                       ANN
             Well, first, you got to change the

   INT. PROD. OFFICE - DAY

   Sign reads THREE DAYS till shoot.

   Walt is on the phone.  Covers the phone.  Crossed sticks on
   the wall, Walt plays with a shuffleboard discus.  Girl P.A.
   brings cup of coffee to Walt.  Her T-shirt reads: "DOES IT
   HAVE TO BE AN OLD MILL?"

                       WALT
                 (to A.D.)
             No, he doesn't want to work out with

             fine, he's not gonna do the Pond scene
             unless he can work out.  Call up his
             girl in Aspen, and have her ship the
             weights out...

   Walt hangs up the phone.  Secretary enters with folders that
   she hands to Walt.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             Who designed these costumes?  Who

             I have no wife.

   A P.A. comes in with a big bakery box.  They open it to show
   it is a huge loaf of bread, and on it is written, in bread,
   "Waterford Welcomes The Old Mill."

             I can't shoot this shot, you want.

                       WALT
             Why?

                       UBERTO
             Because they gots a window with a dogs
             in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or
             can I lose the shot.

                       WALT
             No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning
             of the film is in that shot.

                       UBERTO
             But, Wally, the window of the firehut...

                       WALT

             Yes.

                       WALT
             Did she throw up?

             That isn't very nice.

             Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in
             the World Court.  Did she like the

             I can't tell.

             What...?

                       CLAIRE
             I can't do it, Walt.

                       WALT
             You can't do what?

                       CLAIRE

                       WALT
             Forget the contract.  Claire.  What is
             it?

                       CLAIRE
             I don't want to take my shirt off in
             that con...what are these things that
             they're asking of me...?  Wha...wha...
             wha... I try to be good.  The only thing
             I care about is...

                       WALT
             I know that...

                       CLAIRE
             Is...is the MOVIE!

   As they talk, the A.D.'s come in and hand him sheets to
   approve.

                       WALT
             I know that, Claire.  I, we all know...

                       CLAIRE
             Everybody, they, they, they treat me
             like a...

                       WALT
             ...no, they don't.

                       CLAIRE
             ...they treat me like a child.  I,
             I...to bare my body.

                       WALT
             Now, look.  Claire: Listen to me.
                 (he takes her hand in his)
             I want to tell you a story.

   The door to her room opens.  A P.A. brings in a bunch of
   Lilacs, hands them to Walt.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about
             flowers, we're talking about a human
             being.

                       CLAIRE
             I...I...

                       WALT
             Who are these from?

                       PROD. ASST.
             Marty.

                       WALT
             Well that's very thoughtful of him. 
             Elanora Duse...

                       CLAIRE
             ...I can't do it, Wally...

                       WALT
             Listen to me.  Elanora Duse was playing
             Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty
             could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm
             not doing the seven shows a week I
             signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare
             my soul seven times a week.  I am an
             artist.  I'll do four shows a week."
                 (pause)
             The greatest actress of her time.  You
             know what her Producer said?

                       CLAIRE
                 (pause; softly)
             What?

                       WALT
             Nothing.  He held her and he wept. 
             Because he...

                       CLAIRE
             ...I...

                       WALT
             Because he understood.  That was her
             life's blood on the stage.

   Claire nods, breaks into sobs.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             ...I know...I know...

                       CLAIRE
                 (pause)
             ...and, and, and did she?  And she did
             the seven shows?

                       WALT
             No, she didn't Claire.  But I think you
             should do the scene.

   Secretary comes in with memos and Walt deals with them while
   comforting Claire.  

   BEAT.  She sobs.  She shakes her head.  She brings herself
   under control.

                       CLAIRE
             Wally...

                       WALT
             I know, I know.

   He puts his arm around her, starts walking toward the door.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             I know, it's the hardest thing in the
             world.  And it seems everybody wants...

                       CLAIRE
             Yes...

                       WALT
             ...wants a piece...

                       CLAIRE
             Yes...

                       WALT
             And you know what?

                       CLAIRE
             We, we have to give it.

                       WALT
                 (nods)
             ...and my heart goes out to you, because
             I know...
					  
				  
   INT. PROD. OFFICE - BACK ROOM - DAY

   He opens the door.  We HEAR the First A.D. and the Costume
   Designer chatting outside the door as they walk out.

                       WALT
             That, that's your life's blood on the
             st...

                       FIRST A.D.
             I don't know what she's bitching about,
             she's flashed her tits in the last five
             movies, she'd bare her breasts to do
             voice over.

   CAMERA FOLLOWS the two out.  A tableau of the four of them. 
   The First A.D. drinking coffee, sees he has been overheard.  

   BEAT

   Claire starts soundlessly heaving, sobbing.  She goes "Oh!"
   as if she has just been hit in the stomach, falls back into
   the room, closes the door.  Sobbing sounds emanate.

                       FIRST A.D. (CONT'D)
             I...

                       WALT

             tell him she's breaking her contract and
             we're very up...

             I...

                       WALT
             We're very upset with her.  Get someone
             to double for her, her tits, the tits
             scene.  Call L.A.  I want to see some
             pictures of the women's tits.  Of their
             tits.

                       FIRST A.D.
             I'm very sorry I...

                       WALT
             You're very sorry, you passive
             aggressive, son-of-a-bitch!  Can we
             replace him?

                       BILL
             We start shooting in three days.

                       COSTUME DESIGNER
             You want to see the fireman's costumes? 
             Cause I found this Moleskin for the
             collar, it's not black, but it looks
             black...  it's not brown, but...

                       SECRETARY
             Marty Rossen's touched down.

   EXT. PARK BENCH - DAY

   Ann and Joe sit on a bench.  He is looking at her as she
   finishes the script.  Tears in her eyes.  She closes the
   cover.

                       JOE
                 (beat)
             What I need to say...

                       ANN
             Yes...

                       JOE
             About conflict...

                       ANN
             That's why you didn't want to take the
             Mill out...you've...

                       JOE
             ...the, the, the symbol of the fire...

             The Firehouse...

             But but but but but it's better
             without...

                       JOE
             How...?

                       ANN
             Wait wait wait wait wait he get's a
             second chance, do you see?  And you get
             a second chance!

                       JOE
             No, I don't...

                       ANN
                 (as she holds the script)
             He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets
             a second chance to go back to the
             firehouse...

   Joe takes off one pair of glasses and changes them for
   another.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             You don't need the Mill.  This is what 
                 (she gestures at the script)
             you see: this is what you are.  This is
             what the script is saying...
                 (a person walks by)
             Hi, Emma, see you tonight?

   Emma waves and nods.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             This is, look:
                 (to Emma)
             Go you Huskies.
                 (to Joe)
             ...what I see you saying, is: you have
             the two elements, Fire and Water.  The
             Firehouse, and the Old Mill...do you
             know, you could...

                       JOE
             What are you doing tonight?

                       ANN
             Me?

                       JOE
             Yes.

   Joe and Ann walk down the street.  As they do so they are
   passed by the airport van.

                       ANN
             Tonight, tonight, I...I have play
             practice...

                       JOE
             ...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very
             important.



   EXT. HOTEL STEPS - DAY

   Walt and the A.D. come down the steps to meet the arriving
   airport van.  It stops.  MARTY ROSSEN gets out.  Walt hands
   his bags to a P.A.

                       WALT
             Marteleh, vos macht a yid...?

   He hands Marty the breadloaf.  Marty takes a bite.

                       MARTY
             You cool the broad out?

                       WALT
             I left that for you.

                       MARTY
             That's thoughtful.
                 (of the bread)
             Ziz good, you try this?

   As they speak, a P.A. is unloading Marty's high-end luggage
   from the van.

                       WALT
             Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat
             carbohydrates.

                       MARTY
                 (of the town)
             What'd you do, build this...?

                       WALT
             How was your flight?

                       MARTY
             We're flying over pigs, we're flying
             over sheep...

                       WALT
             Did you bring Bob's weights

                       MARTY
             They're coming Fed Ex.

                       WALT
                 (of the bags)
             What's in all the bags?

                       MARTY
             My undies, cause, you can't get this
             picture off on time I'm gonna wet
             myself.

                       WALT
             I'm gonna bring it off.

                       MARTY
             55 days and I take home the camera.  I
             got an idea for a product placement...

   They start up the stairs when Doc Wilson walks by.  Girl on a
   scooter scooting the other way, her arm in a cast.  Marty and
   Walt turn back to watch on the steps, under the awning.

   Carla walks through carrying food bags.

                       DOC WILSON
             Hiya Sally...

                       GIRL ON A SCOOTER
             Hiya Doc...

                       DOC WILSON
             How's the arm?

                       GIRL ON A SCOOTER
             Still itchin'.

                       DOC WILSON
             Good!  A sign it's getting well.

                       MARTY
                 (of scene)
             Stop...

                       WALT
             That's what I said.

                       MARTY
             How are you getting on with these fine
             people?

                       WALT
             Like dykes and dogs.

   INT. BOB'S ROOM - DAY

   Bob is doing Tai Chi.  Knock on the door.  He goes to open
   it.  Carla is bringing him his dinner.

                       BOB
             Yeah.  Come in.

   She comes in.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
             I'm just...

   She puts his dinner down on the coffee table.  He takes out
   money from his pants to pay her.

                       CARLA
             The prices are going up.

                       BOB
             But, that's the way of the world, huh? 
             Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the
             world.

   He sits before his dinner, hands her some money.  Remembers
   himself.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
             Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you
             like some?

                       CARLA
             I don't eat vegetables.

                       BOB
             Well, I can offer you something to
             drink?

                       CARLA
             Sure, what have you got?

                       BOB
             What do you drink?

                       CARLA
             Bourbon and milk.

                       BOB
             How old are you?

   Carla WHISPERS her age to him.  He makes her a drink out of
   his fridge, hands it to her.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
             Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone I
             gave you this.

                       CARLA
             I wouldn't tell anyone anything that
             happened between me and somebody who was
             my friend.

   PAUSE

                       BOB
             Nice town that you've got here.

                       CARLA
             You want to see it better, we could go
             out on the roof.

                       BOB
             ...wouldn't that be dangerous?

                       CARLA
             ...not if you've got something to hold
             on to.

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DUSK

   Joe is walking down the street.  A script in his hand,
   scribbling.  Uberto walks next to him.

                       UBERTO
             Because if you cannot tells me what is
             it, how I, how does I take a pictures of
             it?  Wally wants me, push in through the
             weendow...

   Joe, as he is scribbling in the script.

                       JOE
             Yeah, no, can I...if you'd excuse me,
             I've just got to...

   He walks away and the CAMERA takes him into a backyard, by a
   bunch of clotheslines.  His glasses fall apart as he changes
   them.  He looks up as the wind blows the sheet.

   He sees Ann, sitting on the backstairs of what, as we draw
   closer, we see is the playhouse.  In back of her we see the
   "Trials of the Heart" flats, seen from the back.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

                       ANN
             Hello.

                       JOE

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

   Joe takes out paper, looks around.  Sighs.  Picks up phone,
   calls back.

                 (into phone)
             This is Joe White... in six ten, they're
             sending up a typist?

   He takes out a sheet of foolscap and a pencil.  Starts to
   write.  A knock at the door.

                       JOE (CONT'D)
                 (into phone)
             Okay, I thank you.  It's here.

   He hangs up the phone, goes to the door, opens it.  It is
   Claire.

                       CLAIRE
             You said, "You can't talk that way to a
             lady..."  You stood up for me.
                 (beat)
             What do you have to drink?

   She looks around, sees a gift basket containing a bottle of
   Stolichnaya and a box of matzoh, wrapped with a "Welcome
   Back" ribbon.

                       CLAIRE (CONT'D)
             Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?

                       JOE
             I, actually, yes.

                       CLAIRE
             I love Jewish men.

                       JOE
             Why?

                       CLAIRE
             You know...where's your bathroom?

   She goes into the bathroom.

                       JOE
             You liked the script, huh...?

   Doug starts to cry.  First A.D. shows up.

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

   Joe is standing by the side of the bed, holding Claire's
   clothes, trying to induce her to put them on.  She is sitting
   on the side of the bed, naked.

                       JOE
             Look.

                       CLAIRE
             I feel so close to you...

                       JOE
             Look, look, I like you very much...

             I like you, too.

             But we...

                       JOE
             Look, look there's someone else...

   Sound of a KNOCK at the door.

                       JOE (CONT'D)
             Great.  Who is it?

                       ANN (O.S.)

   He gestures to the bathroom, he hands her her clothes.

   INT. HALL - NIGHT

   Ann hurriedly arranging the flowers in the "platen" of the
   typewriter.  From inside the room we hear Joe's voice:
   "Alright, one moment!"  He opens the door.

                       ANN
             I'm gonna be your typist for this
             evening.

             Oh, G-d...

             And here's some hydrogen peroxide...

                       JOE
             I don't drink.

                       ANN
             It's for your finger.

                       JOE
             One moment.

   He closes the door.

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

   Claire is still sitting on the bed, has a lit cigarette. 
   Poured herself a drink.  Joe goes over to her, thrusts her
   clothes on the floor.

                       JOE
             You have to hide.

                       CLAIRE
             Who is that?

             Will you help me out...?

                       CLAIRE
             I...

   Joe hustles back to the door.  Opens the door.  Ann is still
   standing there with the typewriter.

                       JOE
             Hi.

                       ANN
             You going to ask me in?

   Joe looks back over his shoulder.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             Thought you might like this.

   She hands him a bouquet.

                       JOE

             Thank you.

             The other side.

   He turns the card over.

             Don't you think you should put them in
             water.

             Why?

                       ANN
             ...because if you don't, they die.

   She goes into the bathroom, fills up the vase.  Comes out.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             Shouldn't we start?

   PAUSE

             Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come
             back at a better time.  What would be a
             better time.

                       JOE
             Later on.

                       ANN
             Then I'll come back, then.

                       JOE
             You, um, you, um, you going out with
             your fiance?

             No, I just broke up with him.  I'll see
             you tomorrow.

   She starts to exit.

   INT. TAVERN INN HALLWAY - NIGHT

   Ann digs in pocket, takes out the lure we previously saw in
   Joe's finger.  She re-enters the room.

   INT. HALL - NIGHT

   Ann puts down the typewriter and types into it, "The truth
   may not always set you free, but it is always the truth -
   Joseph Turner White, 'Anguish.'"  She affixes the lure to it
   and leaves them on the typewriter.  She starts down the hall,
   humming.  Behind her we see the door to Bob Barrenger's room
   open.  Bob comes out, looks down the hall.  The coast is
   clear.  Carla comes out.  They kiss chastely, say goodnight. 
   She starts down the hall, humming.


   EXT. MAYOR'S PORCH - DAY

   The postman walk sup.  We see two workmen putting up a sign
   over the door '1835.'  One has a copy of "The Hollywood
   Reporter" in his back pocket.

                       MAYOR

   A paint truck pulls up outside the Mayor's house.  Painters
   come out.  Sherry comes outside the house.

                       SHERRY
             The house, the 1835.  The original
             kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as

             It's lovely.

                       SHERRY
             A spate of suspicious fires which were
             in fact the inspiration for the
             formation of the Waterford Huskies.

   INT. COFFEE CORNER - DAY

   Geezers are at the front table in the window.  Carla's
   father, JACK, behind the counter trying to assemble an
   espresso machine, reading from the instructions.

                       MORRIS
             "Assembly of Death" did 95 million
             dollars the first weekend.

             They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has
             just died.  He's coming from the fire.

   He shuffles through his pages, he goes in his pocket for a

   smiles back.

             How about, he sees her on the street, he
             wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes
             up to her.  "What happened to the
             horse?"  She looks at him.  She takes
             his hand...

   She takes Joe's hand, and he winces.

                       JOE
             Ah, ah, ah...

                       ANN

             It was burnt.

             Mmm.

                       ANN
             And then it was really hurt.

                       JOE
             Ah, ah, ah.  That's what she says,
             that's what she says.  He says, "Sister,
             I've come from a fire..."  But she, but
             she, she says it was not the fire which
             hurt you...it...

             which hurt him...that the true hurt was
             her.  Was her...

             Anybody here seen Carla?

             Because, because, because if it's about
             purity, it's...it's...and then, then,
             you don't need the nude scene.

             Because it's about purity...

             The movie's about purity.  So we don't
             show her breasts.  We show them to him. 
             She keeps her back to the camera.

                       WALT
             ...she keeps her back to the camera?

                       BILL
             It'll hurt the box-office.

                       JOE
             They know what her tits look like.

             Know?  They could draw them from memory. 
             You're fantastic.  What a find you are.

   He takes out his cardcase.

   Joe, happy as a clam, sauntering down the street.  Smoking a
   huge cigar.  He passes two old codgers, Morris and Spud.

   Joe, as he nods to himself, takes out a pad, starts to jot a
   note, fumbles with his glasses.  Joe saunters on, writing, we
   hear the beeping from the traffic light.  Joe hears a
   screeching of tires.

   He looks up, a film station wagon comes barreling around the
   corner, hits the pothole, goes out of control, careens, turns
   over, knocks down the control box of the traffic light.

   Joe holds a beat, runs over to the car, to driver's side.
   Battered driver, bleeding, upside down.  Joe drags him from
   the car.  It is Bob Barrenger.

                       BOB
             Get the...

   Bob goes over to the phone, his head bandaged.  Walt,
   smoking, stands by the window.

   He hangs up.

             Walt, I wonder if I could take a minute
             of your time.  I need a day off...

   There is an abrupt knocking at the door.

                       WALT
             Who is it?

                       CAL
             Thiz the police.  Is Mr. Barrenger in
             there?

   The boys in the room go into a whisper conference.

                       MARTY
             Okay, look, you, what is she, 19,
             twenty...oh Christ...

   The knock is repeated.

                       CAL
                 (outside the door)
             Is Mr. Barrenger there...?

                       MARTY
             No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't
             put her in the car, she gets it in her
             head to sue, or rape, or some goddamn,

             Joe, the writer?

                       BOB
             Just him and me.

   Knocking was repeated.

                       MARTY
             Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.

                       BOB
             She wasn't in the...

                       MARTY

             Because it's sink or swim here, pals...

   They murmur their assent.  Knocking is repeated.  Walt goes
   to the door.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
                 (to First A.D. and Joe)

   Marty ushers Joe and the First A.D. out the room.

                       MARTY
             Yes...?

   The cop comes in the room.

                       CAL
             I'm very sorry to...

                       MARTY

             Of course he...

             Could I see it, please...?

   Bob gestures to his wallet which is on the desk.

             No.

                       CAL
             And who was driving the...

                       BOB
             I was alone in the car.  I was driving.

   The cop is writing down these statements.

                       CAL
             Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very
             sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could
             be, but...

                       MARTY
             I'm an attorney, if there's anything you
             have to say to...

                       CAL
             ...I have to give you this ticket for

                 (beat)
             You have to what?

   Cal reaches in back of him, on his belt, and takes out not
   the cuffs, but the summons book, he starts to write a
   summons.

                       CAL
             It's a formality.  Any case of damage to
             city prop...you hit the control box of
             the new stop light, and...

                  ticket to Bob)
             They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope
             you're alright, and that you're

   Marty walks him out into the hall.  Photographers and
   onlookers in the hall.  Phone rings.  Walt answers it.

             Yeah.  Hello, Mr. Mayor...Walt Price!

   Door to hall opens.  Claire comes in.

   EXT. FIRESTATION TO PRINTSHOP - NIGHT

   The firetruck is being backed into the firestation.  Outside
   a couple of passerbys are running in the rain, putting their
   collars up.

   We see Joe is in the firestation writing in his book.  As the
   firetruck backs up we see the firedog bark, and Joe looks up.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

   Ann is walking past the firestation.  Joe comes out to look
   at her.

                       JOE
             Hi.

             Where you going?

                       ANN
             Going home.

   They start to walk down the street in the rain.

                       JOE
             Going home, yeah.  I told them what you
             said...

                       ANN
                 (over a clap of thunder)
             What?

   They take refuge under the awning of the printshop.

             I didn't say anything special, I was
             just talking out loud.

             ...how else can you talk?

                       ANN
             No, that's true.

                       JOE
             No.  You, I told them, you can't betray
             with the picture what you're saying with
             the words.  And, I don't know, the
             movies, I don't know.  They should be
             socially uplifting, why does she have to
             show her br...what is this...?

   They look in the window of the old printshop, the awning
   under which they have sheltered.

             Yep, n'it's for sale.
                 (pause)
             One of the few things money can buy.

   Joe looks in the window of the printshop.

                       JOE
             I told them what you said about the
             script...

   They take refuge under the awning of the printshop.

                       ANN
             Would you like to see it?  I've got the
             key back at my store...

                       JOE
             I'd love to.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, runs out into the rain, Joe runs along side her.  In the
   b.g., we see the fireman closing the doors of the firehouse,
   and the firedog being restrained, on a leash, by him and shut
   up inside the firehouse.

   She goes into the washroom area, and comes out with two
   towels.  She throws one to Joe, and begins toweling her hair
   with the other. 

   She hands him some plans, which show photos of the old
   printshop, and copies of the Old Waterford Sentinel, circa
   1900.

                       JOE
             Yes, it's a lovely idea...

   She emerges from the back room.  She has stripped off her wet
   jacket and shirt, and put on a light stockboy's jacket.

                       ANN

   There's another clap of thunder, and all the lights go out. 
   PAUSE.

   Ann takes a small match from the drawer, and lights a small
   kerosene barn lantern.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             Well.  There you go.

   She sits down on the couch, and spreads the plan on a small
   table.

             Press still works.

             You know what else a man can do?

                       ANN
             What?

   He moves closer to her.  He is about to kiss her when the
   firedog appears on the couch between them.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             One moment...

   She goes in the pocket of her jacket.  The dog follows her. 
   She cannot find a dog biscuit.

   BEAT

   Joe pats the dog on the head.  Leads him to the front door,
   puts him out.  The door blows in the rain.

                       JOE
             Pelting down out there.

                       ANN

   She comes close to him.  The dog reappears between them.  Joe
   looks around, and goes back to a window, and shuts the
   window.

   Ann crosses to her desk.  Takes out a box of dog biscuits. 
   The box is empty.  The two of them lead the dog out, and pet
   it on the head.  They turn back and the door is slammed.

   EXT. BOOKSHOP - NIGHT

   They start back to find the door locked.

             Well.  'S'pose I should be getting
             home...look.

   In raingear.

   He covers her with his slicker, and they walk away.

   WE SEE in the b.g. Uberto and his helper at the firehouse. 
   Uberto swings a shuffleboard disk, and the dalmation window
   shatters and falls in the street.  Some falls on his head.

                       BOB
             I've always seen that.

                       WALT
             We don't show her breasts, we just show
             your reaction...

             I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I
             can't tell you...

                       WALT
             Well, Joe said it, and he's right.

   Knock at the door.  Marty goes to the door.

   Carla outside the door, talking to Marty.  Marty takes tray. 
   Carla has bandage on her head and a small cast on her wrist.

             I, well, you know, I tried to take him,
             in his room.

                       MARTY
             I think he's moved...

             makes a lot of...list...listen, cause
             the audience isn't coming to see your

   INT. BAR - MORNING

   The bartender is looking down studying a vast book "State

             sweater...

   First A.D. walks in.  Doc Wilson walks in.

             Mornin', Doc...

                       DOC WILSON
             You doin' here, Doug?  Thought you
             started out the day with that pernicious
             caffeine...

                       DOUG
             Kiss my ass.

                       DOC WILSON
             Well.

                       BARTENDER
             He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him
             for some guy on the movie.

                       DOC WILSON
             Well, they don't always leave with the
             ones they came in with.

                       BARTENDER
             Big day last night.

                       DOC WILSON
             Hope to tell you.  Didn't I pick the
             fragments of glass out of Bob
             Barrenger's actual head myself.

   ANGLE IN THE B.G.

   We see Carla entering with bags of food and checks for bar
   patrons.

                       BARTENDER
             That's what they call an events cluster. 
             Some guy orders a Manhattan, fifteen,
             twenty years, allasudden, three times

             What?

             Who got their heads cut?

             You said three...

             Did I?  I think you're mistaken.

   ANGLE ON

   Doug, looking over at Carla, with a small cast on her wrist

   They stop at a room, knock on the door.  A PAUNCHY SALESMAN
   opens the door.

             I've got the wrong room.

   The Procession reverses, starts down the hall, runs into
   Marty coming out of his room.

                       DOUG (CONT'D)
                 (to Cal)
             Arrest him.

             What is the...?

                       DOUG
             Arrest him.

                       CAL
             For what...?

                       DOUG
                 (beat)
             Conspiracy in Statutory Rape.

                       MARTY
             Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of
             whom?

                       DOUG
             This young woman.

                       CARLA
             Nobody touched me, I was at home.

                       MARTY
                 (to Carla)
             Who is it raped you?

                       CARLA
             Nobody.

                       MARTY
             Well, what's the beef?

                       DOUG
             She was in the car with Bob Barrenger
             last night.  And she was injured coming
             home from a love tryst, so...

                       MARTY
             You were in the car with Bob?

                       CARLA
             No.

                       MARTY
             Then what is the...?

   He steps back into a linen closet, takes Doug with him by the
   lapels.

   INT. LINEN CLOSET - HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY

                       MARTY
             Now what is this, you sonofabitch! 
             Because if you haven't heard about the
             laws of Malicious Prosecution, you're
             about to.  DON'T FLINCH WHILE I'M
             TALKING TO YOU, YOU TWO BIT SPEEDTRAP
             FRAUD: There's an old saying, two
             scariest things in the world, a black
             man with a knife and a Jew with a
             lawyer.  Now, I am a lawyer, and I am
             the Jew, and you continue ONE MOMENT
             with this slanderous shit here in this
             public place, I'm going to have your ass
             over my mantleplace.  THE KID WAS NOT IN

             YOU KNOW IT.  SO I'M NOT PAYING PATSY
             WITH YOU HERE, YOU MOTHERFUCKER.  Look
             in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks
             last year and I don't like being trifled
             with.  Now I think that the better part
             of valor, though we've got your back up
             here...the better part of valor is to
             step away.  Or, before G-d, I will see
             you disbarred.
                 (beat)
             Now, what do you think?
                 (beat)
             We all have a movie to make.  Now, can
             we stay together here...?
                 (pause)
             What do you say?  Have a cigar.

   He puts a cigar into Doug's pocket.

   INT. HALL - CONTINUOUS

   The two come out of the linen closet, Marty with his arm
   around Doug.

                       MARTY
             It's a mistake.  It's all over.
                 (to Carla)
             I'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.

                       CARLA
             I wasn't in the car.

                       MARTY
             We know that you weren't.

   They walk down the hall.  Before them, Claire, half-clothed,
   backing out of a motel room.

                       CLAIRE
             ...because you treat me like a
             child...you treat me like a child...
             that's why I can't come...

   The procession has reached the open door.  They look to see

             Look, Carla, this is a hard time for

             I did...and we all dream of it, and
             here, here Hollywood has come to you.

                       CAL
             Mr. Barrenger, I'm very sorry, but...

                       WALT
             Here this dream world has come to you. 
             Now, you obviously have an active, a

             Her...

             I swear that that woman in my room...

                       WALT
             Be quiet, Bob.  A fertile mind.  Now we
             can use that kind of people in our work. 
             Yes, we can.  Now, and this is what
             occurs to me... There's a part in the
             film...isn't that right, Marty?

   Marty is perusing the lawbooks.

                       MARTY
             Mmm.

                       WALT
             That we could use you in and I think
             that's quite a fine trade-off all around
             and an ill wind that blows somebody
             good.

                       MARTY
                 (of the book)

                 (he shows the book to Doug)
             Hold on, Bobby.
                 (to Doug)
             You've got nothing and you know it.  By
             G-d, you know it.  Harassment.  You need
             a... even if this was true, you need a
             witness.  You need someone puts her in
             the car.  And you've got nothing.  Now
             we all have...yes, give her that part in
             the film.
                 (to Carla)
             Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we
             all have more important things to do,
             isn't that right...?

   Marty starts ushering everyone out of the room.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
             Isn't that right?  I'm sorry that you
             all went to this...

                       JACK
             I knew she wasn't in the car.

                       MARTY
             This has been just an unfortunate.

   He ushers them out, the phone is ringing.  Walt picks it up.

             So we just got lucky.

                       BILL
             Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast.  He
             needs your confirmation on a request for
             money...?

                       MARTY
             And I need a drink.

   Marty exits.

                 (to Bob)
             If your memory was as long as your dick,
             you'd be in good shape.  How long since
             you almost went to jail for this shit?

                       BOB
             How could she turn on me like that?  I
             thought she liked me.

                       WALT
             Can we try to keep our pants buttoned
             and get out of this town in one piece?

                       BOB
             I'm ready!

                       WALT
             Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your
             room.

                       BOB
             What'll I do for fun?

                       MARTY
             Whyn't you learn your lines?

                       BOB
             I know my lines...

                       WALT
             You do...?

                       BOB
             I just don't know what order they come
             in...

   Walt walks away from Bob, shaking his head.

   ANGLE ON

   Walt, as he walks down the stairs.

                       WALT
             I tell you what, let's ditch these
             cockamamie locals.  I need to get outta
             here.  Go to some roadhouse tonight,
             just us.  Claire, Bob, siddown, have a
             bottle of wine.  Tell me where we're
             going, and let's go.

   They walk by the bullpen, wherein we see P.A.s refilling
   Evian bottles from a ratty old watering can.

   P.A.s take us, with their Evian bottles, into Walt's office,
   where we see the "Dinner with the Mayor" sign.

   INT. MAYOR'S HOME - NIGHT

   Twelve overdressed people, including the Postman, the
   Gunstore Owner, etc. sitting, still around the Mayor's laden
   dining table.  BEAT.  Sherry looks over her shoulder.

   ANGLE ON

   Next room, the Mayor on the phone.  Hushed.

                       MAYOR
             Well, you must, where did they...
             where...I...

   PAUSE

   Very angry, he HANGS UP and looks out the window.

   ANGLE POV

   The Mayor lets the shade drop, walks back to the table. 
   Silence.

   INT. BAR - NIGHT

   Doug, in his cups, at the end of the bar with the First A.D.

                       DOUG
             Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...

                       FIRST A.D.
             My wife just went into labor...

   The bartender studies his state statutes book.

   BARTENDER'S POV

   Inside the book, the storyboards show the movie's heroes
   copulating.

                       DOUG
             Half a buck I'd close it down.  It's
             per...you know...it's perfidy, you got
             your Barrenger, molesting little girls.

                       FIRST A.D.
             He should be put in jail.

                       DOUG
             Half a buck I'd put him in jail.

                       FIRST A.D.
             You should.

                       DOUG
             I had a witness, I would.

                       FIRST A.D.
             A witness to what?

                       DOUG
             You know, the rape, to...even to the
             accident.

                       FIRST A.D.
             You mean with White?

                       DOUG
             What?

                       FIRST A.D.
             You mean you need a witness in addition
             to White?

                       DOUG
             Who's White?

                       FIRST A.D.
             The writer.

                       DOUG
                 (beat)
             He saw the accident...?

                       FIRST A.D.
             Sure.

                       DOUG
             He saw the girl in the car...

                       FIRST A.D.
             You bet he did.

   INT. MAYOR'S HOME - NIGHT

   The Mayor and his wife alone at the table.  The maid emptying
   trays of food, untouched, into a galvanized steel garbage
   pail placed in the middle of the room.  One of the guests
   leaving, putting on her coat.  Dips back into the dining room
   to try to pick up a tray of pate.

                       SHERRY
             Don't you touch that... I want them
             gone.

                       MAYOR
             I signed the permit.  I don't know how I
             can.

                       SHERRY
             I want them thrown in jail.

                       MAYOR
             Sherry, Sherry...

   She empties it into the trash.  BEAT.  The guest, chagrined,
   leaves.  The Mayor, sitting and drinking booze out of a large
   glass.  The phone RINGS.  BEAT.  He goes to answer it.

                       MAYOR (CONT'D)
                 (into phone)
             What?
                 (he jiggles the receiver)
             Get me the State Police.

   EXT. PRINT SHOP - DAY

   A sign in the window, "Sold" is stamped over and reads "Under
   Agreement."

   Early summer morning.  Joe, holding a cup of coffee, looking
   at the print shop.  Ann walks up.

                       JOE
             Good morning.

                       ANN
             Sleep well?

                       JOE
             Yeah, you?

                       ANN
             Oh yeah...

                       JOE
             We could live up here, live up in the
             country.

                       ANN
             Now you're talking...

                       JOE
             And we could get up every morning...

                       ANN
             ...well, we do that anyway...

                       JOE
             And come to the printshop.  You know
             why?

                       JOE (CONT'D)
             To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to
             write.  To write.  To write.  Right here
             in the office.

                       ANN
             Not without a rolltop desk.

                       JOE
             Well, I could get a rolltop desk.

                       ANN
             Happen to know where there's one for
             sale.

                       JOE
             Well ain't you amazing.

   They walk on, onto the scene of various filmfolk setting up.

   EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

                       ANN
             Lookit that, up already.

                       JOE
             That's why we filmfolk get along so well
             with you farmers.  Both up with the
             chickens.

   They push through the mass.  The street is closed off by
   Police Cars.

   They come upon a TV REPORTER doing a standup in front of the
   firehouse where we see, in front, both the old firetruck and
   state trooper cars.

                       TV REPORTER
             Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh
             from his troubles with the law last
             year...

   ANGLE ON

   Ann and Joe, as they look on.

   ANGLE ON

   A state trooper and Doug, as they walk through the crowd. 
   Marty walks up to the TV REPORTER.

                       TV REPORTER (CONT'D)
             ...is once again in hot water.  Involved
             in a car crash last night with a young,
             a very young woman, Mr. Barrenger is
             being arrested today for...

                       MARTY
             You better make sure you got your facts
             straight, pal, cause, you step off the
             line and I'm going to sue you personally
             for...

   The trooper, Doug, and Bob Barrenger walk up to Marty.

                       TROOPER
             We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.

                       MARTY
             Oh, good, yes.  Good morning.  Where are
             you taking Mr. Barrenger?

                       TROOPER
             We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner
             White?

                       MARTY
             What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?

                       DOUG
             He's under arrest.

   Doug hands the arrest warrant to Marty.

                       MARTY
             Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must
             be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're
             about one-half step from a world of
             hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna
             have your ass.  Can I watch?

   CAMERA takes the group, the trooper, Doug, Bob, in handcuffs,
   Marty talking with them, through the crowd, on the back of
   which we see Ann and Joe.

                       DOUG
             Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent
             me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a
             history of...

                       MARTY
             ...a history of nothing, he was
             acquitted.

                       DOUG
             Moral turp...you're on my home court,
             friend.  I have the Mayor and the town
             behind me, and forget making your movie:
             I may own the studio when I get through
             with you: I got a civil suit, I got
             rape, I got collusion...

                       MARTY
             You've got nothing, you don't have a
             witness...

                       DOUG
             And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White
             saw the crime.

                       MARTY
             He told you that!?

                       DOUG
             He didn't have to tell.

                       MARTY
             I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...

                       DOUG
             Oh, you're his attorney, too?

                       MARTY
             Later for you, pal.

                       DOUG
             Okay.

   He motions the cop to take out Barrenger.  Marty sees Joe in
   the back.

                       MARTY
             Bobby, don't say anything.

                       BOB
             Nothing happened.

                       DOUG
             We'll see about that at the inquest.

   ANGLE ON

   Marty, as he leads Joe down into an alleyway, and into a
   backyard, hung with washing on the lines.

                       MARTY
             Yeah, hi, pal.  I need to talk to you.
					 
					  
   INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

   Ann, Joe and Marty.  Cal has followed them into the
   bookstore.  He speaks privately with Ann and exits.

                       ANN
             What is it all about?

                       JOE
             I saw...

                       MARTY
             How do they know that, you told them?

                       JOE
             No.

                       MARTY
             What did you say to them?

                       JOE
             I didn't say anything to them.

                       MARTY
             How do you know you saw it?

                       JOE
             I don't know.

                       MARTY
             Well, then, you didn't see it, right?

                       JOE
             I don't...

                       MARTY
             You didn't see it...

                       JOE
             I...?  I saw it.  I was there.

                       MARTY
             You were there.  At...at 10:35...?

   Joe takes the arrest warrant.  Looks at it.  Changes his
   glasses.

                       JOE
                 (as he reads)
             I was walking down the street...I
             remember, I was writing a...

                       MARTY
             What glasses were you wearing?
                 (pause)
             Were you wearing your reading glasses?

                       JOE
             I...

                       MARTY
             You told me you were writing.  Don't you
             wear your reading glasses to write...?

   Marty's cellphone rings and he answers it.  After a pause, he
   hangs up.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
             I've got to go to the jail.

   He exits, leaving Walt alone with Ann and Joe.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann.  She sees something down the other street.  We see Cal,
   the policeman, enter and start toward Joe.  We see Ann
   restrain him, and speak to him in the b.g. for several
   moments.  He shakes his head, and she reasons with him, and
   there is a pause and he looks at Joe, and exits.

   BEAT

                       ANN
             ...he's going to give you a couple of
             minutes.

   Joe walks Ann off to the closed back door of "The Waterford
   Players."

                       JOE
             What am I gonna do?

                       ANN
             You got to tell 'em that you saw the
             accident.  Don't you?

                       JOE
             I can't do that.
                 (pause)
             If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them,
             they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...
             it'll ruin his career...

                       ANN
             But that's what happened.

                       JOE
             But it'll stop the movie.

                       ANN
             Maybe they'll be other movies.

                       JOE
             They'll...they'll blackball me.

                       ANN
             Carla was in the car, right?

   PAUSE

                       JOE
             What'm I gonna do?

   Ann picks up a copy of the old Waterford Sentinel, which was
   left on the coffee table.  Ann hands the paper to Joe.

   ANGLE ON

   Joe, holding the paper.

   ANGLE INS.

   The masthead reads, "Waterford Sentinel, All the News of the
   Mountains, 'You Shall Not Bear False  Witness.'"

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, who has also picked up the "For Sale" sign, showing the
   printshop.  She stands looking at Joe.  BEAT.  Cal enters. 
   They look towards him.

                       CAL
             Lotta hubbub on the street.  I'm taking
             you the back way.


   EXT. BACKYARD OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

   Cal walks with Joe, still holding the newspaper.  As they
   round a housecorner, Walt appears and walks with Joe.

                       WALT
                 (checks watch)
             Let's speak English.  You've got to help
             the side.

                       JOE
             You want me to lie.

                       WALT
             To the contrary.  I want you to tell the
             truth.
                 (pause)
             The truth is, you can't tell me, to a
             certainty, that you saw the thing.  You
             don't remember, a gun to your head,
             which glasses you have on.  And you have
             a fertile imagination.  Imagination
             wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  IF
             you aren't sure, then they have nothing. 
             Bob walks free.  As he should.
                 (pause)
             Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors
             at the crossroads with a stake through
             their heart, you know?  The people who
             are talking to you about the way we live
             though we may praise them, we fear them. 
             And they fear us.  Because we tell the
             truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a
             damn roost, and everyone knows it;
             the guy is looking for a case, he wants
             to make a name for himself...If we let
             him do that, if we let him do that, then
             we're being false to our community...to
             our community, you understand?  To our
             world.  Cause you are a part of that
             world, now.  You have to take off the
             steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.
                 (pause)
             And be part of your world.  I got a five
             picture deal with the studio.  And you
             stick with me.  You write one, two more,
             you stick with me, and you'll direct the
             third one.  You are a part of this
             world.  You have to do the right thing:
             we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff,
             literally is at our door.  You have to
             stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the
             bottom line.  You have to...if you had
             the leisure to think it through, you'd
             see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in
             the car.

   Cal takes Joe to a side door of the courthouse.

   INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

   Joe coming in through the side entrance of the courtroom. 
   Various law books and dusty forms on the shelves.  Cal leads
   him into the courtroom, empty, save for the court reporter,
   Maude and the BAILIFF.  Cal motions Joe forward.

                       CAL
             ...Joseph Turner White...

                       BAILIFF

             Flynn presiding.  All those having
             business before this court, draw forward
             and you will be heard.

   Judge enters.

                       BAILIFF (CONT'D)
             All rise.

                       JUDGE
             Please...Mr. White?  This is a simple
             matter of...

   Scott hands him a sheet of paper.

                       JUDGE (CONT'D)
             Uh huh, all we need's a simple fact or
             to...you're going to give your
             recollection of the accident last
             evening, at the corner, State and Main. 
             Would you please swear him in.

                       BAILIFF
             Do you swear to tell the truth...

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

   A crowd, moving along, with the TV Reporter.

                       TV REPORTER
                 (talking into camera)
             ...the arraignment, as we said of Bob
             Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of
             "The Old Mill," about to begin shooting
             here, in picaresque and sleepy...
                 (sound of shouting, and
                  reporter looks around)
             we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes,
             yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley,
             and we're going to try to get a look
             at...

   The crowd moves away, revealing Ann, standing in front of the
   realtors, looking at a card in her hand.  She looks up to see
   Joe coming toward her.
			
			

   ANGLE ON

   Extreme close up, she smiles.

   ANGLE ON

   Extreme close up, Joe.  He looks toward Ann, sheepishly.

   ANGLE BACK ON

   Ann, as she looks down at the card in her hands.

   ANGLE INSERT

   It is the real estate placard for the printshop, marked
   "under agreement."

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, as she rips it up.

   INT. LOBBY OF THE HOTEL - DAY

   Joe, coming in, a hangdog look on his face.

                       P.A.
                 (to Joe)
             They need those rewrites on the "Old
             Mill" scene...

   Joe nods.  Continues through the lobby.

   ANGLE ON

   Various reporters, Scott being interviewed.

                       SCOTT
             ...about his personal life, though I can
             tell you a few things about...

   Joe walks past.

                       JOE
             Would you please hold all calls to my
             room?

                       SCOTT
             Though I can tell you a few things about
             his dietary requirements.

   The old bellhop is packing up his lunchbox and changing into
   his streetclothes.

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY

   Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil.  He sits on the
   bed.  On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red
   hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been
   knitted in baby blue.  There is a card in the picket that
   reads "Better than new -- it's got a story!"  He puts it
   down.

   He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: "The
   Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same
   mistake twice."

   He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts
   the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The
   truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth 
   - Joseph Turner White."

   Joe goes to the bed.  On the bed is a small package tied with
   ribbon.  Joe opens it.

   ANGLE INS.

   It is a small thing of maple syrup.  Attached to it is a card
   reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet."

   He takes off his jacket, and picks up his notebook.  Out of
   his jacket pocket falls the old copy of the Waterford
   Sentinel.

   He picks it up.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

   The masthead: Waterford Sentinel "The Voice of the Mountains,
   You Shall Not Bear False Witness."

   He puts the newspaper down.  Picks up the maple sugar card
   again, and looks at it.

   He sees an arrow and turns it over

   ANGLE INS.

   The back of the card reads: "How about an Associate Producer
   credit...?"

   He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the
   trash.  He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the
   typewriter.  Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it
   in the trash.  Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and
   starts packing...

   EXT. ANN'S STREET - DAY

   On Doc Wilson, as he walks down the street.  A little kid, on
   a scooter is going in the other direction.

                       KID ON SCOOTER
             Mornin', Doc.

                       DOC WILSON
             Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a
             hurry?

                       KID ON SCOOTER
             Down the corner, see the ruckus...

                       DOC WILSON
             Watch the curbs, now...

   ANGLE ON

   Joe, as he stands across from Ann's house, looking at it.  He
   holds his suitcase.

                       DOC WILSON (CONT'D)
                 (of his suitcase)
             Where you off to?

                       JOE
             I, uh...I'm leaving...

                       DOC WILSON
             Why?

                       JOE
             I perjured myself.
                 (pause)
             I told a lie, and I ruined my life. 
             That's what I did.  
                 (shrugs)
             I don't suppose you could help me with
             that, could you?  Turn back the clock,
             or something?  Give me back my, give me
             back my purity, I don't suppose you
             could just wave your magic wand and do
             that, could you?  But what is truth? 
             Eh?  Ain't that the thing?  What is
             true?

                       DOC WILSON
             It's the truth that you should never
             trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's
             s'posed to point down to accentuate the
             genitals, why'd you wanna trust
             somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate
             his ears?

   Joe turns to see Doc swigging from his flask.  In the b.g.,
   we see the bellhop walking.

   BEAT

                       JOE
             Aren't you supposed to set an example
             for people?

                       DOC WILSON
             Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold
             people's hands while they die.  What'd
             you say your problem was?

                       JOE
             I just swore my life away, back in
             that...

                       DOC WILSON
                 (as he sees an older woman off
                  on a porch to the side)
             Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?

   Doc walks off to his office.

   EXT. RAILROAD STATION - DAY

                       JOE
             I ruined my life.  Isn't that funny,
             that you can actually do it in one
             moment just like they say.  I ruined my
             life back in that courthouse.

   Bellhop, who has walked up beside him...

                       BELLHOP
             What courthouse?

                       JOE
             Courthouse back in town.

                       BELLHOP
             Town ain't got no courthouse.

                       JOE
             What?

                       BELLHOP
             Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse
             burnt down, 1960.

   The train is arriving.  The stationmaster puts out the steps
   to help the people down.

                       JOE
             Well, where do they hold court?

                       BELLHOP
             Hold court, they have to, science lab,
             the high school.

   An ELDERLY LOOKING JUDGE FELLOW descends from the train,
   followed by the CADDY with his golf bag.

                       STATION MASTER
             Mornin', judge, what brings you here?

                       JUDGE
             I'm s'posed to hear some deposition,
             some fool saw the accident last night.

                       JOE
             ...the courthouse burnt down...?

                       STATION MASTER
             Yep.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.  Part
             of a spate of fires, Old Mill,
             Courthouse... S'posed to've been set by
             some deranged teenager.

   Joe looks around.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

   The old bellhop walking down the tracks.

   ANGLE ON 

   Joe, as he turns back into town.

   ANGLE CLOSE UP

   On the Station Master.

                       STATION MASTER (CONT'D)
             Yep, never did discover who set 'em...

   He smiles, and lights his cigar.

   EXT. COURT HOUSE BUILDING - DAY

   We see the crowd has moved down the street and the
   "Courthouse" building is empty.

   INT. COURT HOUSE BUILDING - DAY

   Joe enters, and the camera takes him into the deserted
   building, through the courtroom and, in back, he sees Ann
   standing alone.  He walks back to her, through the doors
   which appear to be the Judge's chambers.

   ANGLE REVERSED

   We show that the walls of the Courtroom are the set, and we
   are back in the "Trials of the Heart" set.  Ann is sitting
   there.  Reading her play by Joe White.  He looks at her for
   an explanation.  Maude, the court reporter woman, is sitting
   in the b.g.  Ann is knitting in pink wool.

                       ANN
             I thought you needed to get it out of
             your system.

   Ann moves to embrace Joe.  They hear screaming.  They turn.

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

   ANGLE THEIR POV

   At the end of the alleyway, in Main Street.  We see Sherry,
   the Mayor's wife, leading a crowd.

                       SHERRY
             ...a blight, a blight and an
             obscenity...that's good English, isn't
             it?  How's that for entertainment?

   ANGLE

   At the mouth of the alleyway, on Main Street.  We see:

   ANGLE INS.

   The baseball on which is written "To Chucky from your best
   friend, Bob Barrenger."

   ANGLE XCU

   The distorted face of Chucky, heaving the baseball.

   ANGLE ON

   Bob Barrenger being led through the crowd, a baseball hitting
   him in the back of the head, as troopers hustle him toward
   the courthouse.  In the b.g., Ann and Joe emerging in the
   alleyway.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann and Joe, who starts to cross the street.  We see the
   airport van.

                       ANN
             What are you going to do?

                       JOE
             I'm going to tell the truth.

   They start to cross the street.  In the b.g., a little man
   with a bag (HOWIE) gets out of the airport van.  Joe and Ann
   walk toward the crowd at the mouth end of the high school.

   INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

   A crowd of people, TV technicians, and a view of Doug on a TV
   monitor.

                       DOUG
             ...and to exterminate this vermin, yes,
             I use that term, who have abused, who
             have desecrated, yes, the license
             granted to them by a gracious nation...

   ANGLE ON

   Marty and Walt, standing near the monitor, looking on. 
   Shaking their heads.

   ANGLE ON

   The monitor.  Doug, seen through the monitor.

             ...who spew filth and degradation...
                 (begins to wipe his head)

   As he does so, a makeup person comes in and sponges him.

                       DOUG (CONT'D)
             ...thank you...

                       TV REPORTER

   ANGLE ON

   Doug, seen "live" in the next room, starting to wipe his
   brow.

                       DOUG
             Yes, thank you.

   ANGLE ON

   Marty and Walt watching Doug, as he walks down the hall.

                       TECHNICIAN
             Five minutes, and we're going live to
             the network.

                       DOUG
                 (to himself)
             ...foreign, and un-American perversions

   ANGLE ON

   Marty and Walt, looking on.

                       WALT
             Do something.

                       MARTY
             You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

   They look on to the preparations for the TV.

                       WALT
             ...and I was just paying off my house in
             Malibu...

   Ann and Joe push through the crowd.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             Thank G-d, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to
             you...

                       JOE
             The girl was in the car.

                       WALT
             I treated you like a son or nephew.

                       JOE
             It's no you, it's...

                       WALT
             No, what is it?

                       JOE
             I have to tell the truth.

                       WALT
             ...that's just so narrow...

                       JOE
             The girl was in the car.

                       WALT
             Then you're finished in show business.

                       JOE
             So be it.

                       WALT
             And my company sues your ass for sixty
             million dollars.

                       JOE
             For what cause?

                       WALT
             I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.

   HOWIE GOLD shows up holding his bag.

                       HOWIE
             I'm a lawyer.

                 (presenting the bag)
             For this...I hope you need it, cause
             it's coming outta your budget...

   ANGLE INS.:

   The Bag, as Marty opens it - it's full of MONEY.
			

   INT. LAVATORY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

   Doug is mopping his face up.  He looks up.  Marty is standing
   there.

                       MARTY
             Hi.

                       DOUG
             I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.

                       MARTY
             I....

                       DOUG
             ...you know, there's nothing you could
             say, that could possibly make a
             difference, so, why don't you just save
             your breath...

   Marty puts the case up on the washstand.

                       DOUG (CONT'D)
             What's in the case?

                       MARTY
             Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.

   PAUSE

                       DOUG
             And what was it you wanted to say?

                       MARTY
             Gut Yuntif.

   INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

   Ann and Joe passing through.  They stop and Joe comes up to a
   State Trooper.  As we press forward the Mob begins to reverse
   direction and passes back towards Joe.  Leaving the Hall
   empty, save for the Judge who comes out, putting his robs
   into his golf bag.

                       JOE
                 (to Judge)
             I've come to give myself up...

                       JUDGE
             Well give yourself up to someone else. 
             I'm gonna get in some golf.  Hiya,
             Annie.  Give yourself up to her.

   And we see Joe has moved up to the TV monitor, where we see
   Doug, in the Science Lab, talking to the press, and holding
   his money bag in his arms.

                       DOUG
             I have learned a lesson.  And the lesson
             is this...that everybody needs a second
             chance.  You, me, and these fine, film
             people here.  You know, they have a high
             profile, but that doesn't mean they
             aren't deserving of our trust, and of
             our respect. 
             You know, I think there is a lesson
             here, and the lesson is this: it is a
             lesson of Tolerance...and, as we look at
             this industry, at this clean, American
             industry, and as I begin my campaign for
             congress...

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

   Walt on the scene, talking with the cinematographer, and the
   Camera Operator, preparing the first shot.  The First A.D.
   instructing the extras.

                       FIRST A.D.
             Okay.  Are we getting set up here...are

   EXT. MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS

   ANGLE ON

   Ann.  As she, holding the placard starts to cross the street. 
   An old farmer smoking a pipe, driving a pick up is stopped by
   a P.A. talking on a walkie.

   We see that it is the "Judge" who listened to Walt's
   testimony.  Ann waves to him, and proceeds to the Old
   Firehouse, where they are about to make a movie...

                       FIRST A.D.
             Okay, this is picture...

   Ann stops at the back of the crowd of onlookers.  She waves
   to someone.

   ANGLE ANN'S POV

   It is Joe, sitting near the director, who waves back.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, who is next to Cal, the policeman, now in leather jacket
   and leaning on his Harley motorcycle.

                       FIRST A.D. (CONT'D)

   ANGLE ON

   The slate, which reads "The Fires Of Home."

   EXT. MAIN STREET - FIRESTATION - CONTINUOUS

   Where they are filming the characters in turn of the century
   garb.  Bob Barrenger, dressed as a fireman, is polishing the
   old fire engine.  The actor playing Doc Morton walks past.

                       DOC MORTON
             Mornin', Harry.  Heard you had a little
             fire last night.

                       FIREMAN
             Waal, you didn't have nothin' to do,
             Doc, wouldn't life be dull...?

   Two nuns walk by.

                       BOB
             Mornin', sister.

                       CLAIRE

             Sister, I've just come from a fire...

   ANGLE ON

   Joe, sitting near the camera, looking through the script. 
   Reading along, mouthing the words.  He wears the plaid
   jacket, one sleeve is pink, knitted.

   ANGLE ON

   The on-lookers.  Ann, Cal, next to her, lounging on his
   motorcycle.  Grace and Maude, Spud and Morris, the Postman,
   the fake Judge, who is also the man smoking the pipe in the
   first sequence and is smoking a pipe now, Scott from the
   hotel, etc.

   ANGLE ON

   Crew, and the film within the film.  We see the lively stable
   across the way.  On its side are painted various ads.  Among
   them, one which says: "Stefan P. Bazoomercom" and Marty is
   standing next to it.  Looking on at the scene being filmed.

   An A.D. brings him a cup of coffee.  The A.D. is passing out
   pink bubblegum cigars, the bands of which read "It's a Girl!"

   ANGLE ON

   Film within the film, the group at the camera watching,
   transfixed.

                       SISTER
             ...to come by next Sunday, and we'll
             give you a second chance.

                       BOB
             Only second chance I know, chance t'make
             the same mistake twice.

                       SISTER
             Well, time will tell.

   She walks past the "Bazoomer.com" ad.

                       FIRST A.D.
                 (holding cellphone to his ear)
             That's a cut!

   ANGLE ON

   Ann and Cal, as they talk, the firedog comes over and Ann
   gives him a biscuit.  In the b.g., we see the man with the
   pipe get into his pickup and drive off.  The Postman goes off
   continuing his rounds.

   ANGLE ON 

   Ann and Cal as they talk.  Next to them Morris and Spud
   congratulate each other.  Next to them, we see the fake judge
   and the bailiff.

                       CAL
             Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.

                       ANN
             I'll be there.

                       CAL

   ANGLE ON 

   Joe, as he looks over at Ann and smiles.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, giving him a "thumbs up" sign as the Firedog comes and
   sits next to her.  In the b.g., we see the pickup hit the
   pothole and bounce.

                                                 FADE TO BLACK.





   THE END.
FADE IN:

   EXT. FIREHOUSE - DAY

   Ann is walking down the street.  The firedog runs out of the
   firehouse, she gives the dog a biscuit, and pats him on the
   head. 

   The fireman is out front with a cup of coffee.  Ann hands him
   a poster.

   EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - DAY

   Morris and Spud, two codgers, are about to cross the street
   when they hear a beeping and stop.

   As they cross, we see the tail end of a van, and the group
   nods in that direction.

                       MORRIS
             You hear that?

                       SPUD
             Yes, I hear it.

                       MORRIS
             Drive a man to drink.  Took me near half
             an-hour, get across the street
             yesterday.

                       SPUD
             I saw Budgie Gagnon, leaning on the bank
             of the building.  Said, "What are you
             doin'?"  He said, "I'm waitin' for the
             'leven o'clock crossing..."

   As Morris and Spud speak a car is coming down the street, and
   bounces in the pothole.

                       MORRIS
             Y'wanna fix something, you should fix
             the pothole.  Yessir, they should be
             trussed up, thrown off some high
             building.

   DOUG MACKENZIE, a young Republican type, walks up to join
   them.

                       DOUG
             Who's that?

                       MORRIS
             Whoever spent ten, f'teen thousand
             dollars, a new traffic light, you could
             grow old, paint your house before it
             lets you cross the street, and then, not
             fix the pothole.

                       SPUD
             What was wrong with the old traffic
             light?

   INT. COFFEE CORNER - DAY

   They enter the Coffee Corner.  Carla is serving the folk, and
   Jack the owner is behind the counter.

                       DOUG
             I'm glad you asked... I'll tell you what
             was wrong with it.  And what was wrong
             with it was it was behind the times. 
             Now: You want to bring business into
             this town?  You have to plan for a
             Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at
             the moment, no...

                       ANN
             Morning, darling.

                       DOUG
             Morning.

                       CARLA
             Hi, Annie.

   Ann hands Carla a poster.

                       ANN
             Morning, Carla.

   Doug and the two codgers move to a table by the window where
   Carla, the nubile waitress, brings them coffee.  Ann talks to
   a woman at the counter.

                       MORRIS
             ...the damn thing...

                       SPUD
             No, I'm serious, election's coming up, a
             lot of people are pretty upset...

                       DOUG
             They are, yes.  I'm sure they are...

                       WOMAN AT COUNTER
             Annie, I'm going to be a lil' late for
             the rehearsal, tonight.

                       ANN
             S'Okay, Maude.  You know your lines...?

                       DOUG
             ...I'm sure that people are upset...

                       MAUDE
             I know 'em, I don't know what order they
             come in...

                       ANN
             We'll work it out.

                       JACK 
             What're they talking about?

                       ANN
             Traffic light.

                       JACK
             Waal, no, th'traffic light's Doug's
             thing.  That's his thing, fine.

                       DOUG
             Thank you, Jack, and...

                       JACK
             But we got to talk about the pothole.

                       DOUG
             Jack...

                       JACK
             A public office is a public trust...
             This is why this is America.  Question
             is: who owns the street.

   Outside the front booth, on the street, the airport van
   cruises by.
			
   
			EXT. STATE AND MAIN - DAY

   As they walk out we hear a high pitched beeping sound at the
   traffic light.  We see DOC WILSON crossing the street,
   holding his doctor's bag.  An ELDERLY MAN approaches Doc at
   the crossing.  As Walt and Bill walk, the airport van follows
   them.

                       TOWNSMAN
             Doc, those pills, y'gave me for my back? 
             I'm not sure that they work.

                       DOC WILSON
             Well, I'm not sure either, but y'don't
             hear me complain... come by th'office,
             end of th'afternoon.

                       TOWNSMAN
             Thanks, Doc...

                       BILL
             This is your movie, this is small town
             America.

                       WALT
             Town in New Hampshire was small town
             America, too.  Forty thousand dollars a
             day, to shoot on the street.  And then
             they kicked us out...

   They stop in front of a rack of fifty "factory seconds."

   Black and red hunting jackets, in front of the sporting goods
   store.  The sign reads "FACTORY SECONDS, FIVE DOLLARS."

                       BILL
             A jacket for five dollars... I can buy
             this town for fifty bucks.

                       WALT
             You told me that about the last town.

                       BILL
             Yeah, but they never made a movie here.

                       WALT
             I'm bleeding, Bill, I'm bleeding...

                       BILL
             ...why am I here?

                       WALT
             What, what, what, what do they got that
             can pass for the Old Mill?

   Bill shows Walt a brochure from Waterford, which shows a
   picture of the Old Mill.  Walt reads.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             "The Waterford Mill, built in 1825, and
             long a tourist attraction..." Wake up
             Uberto

   ANGLE:

   INT. THE AIRPORT VAN - CONTINUOUS

   UBERTO is asleep.  Bill wakes him up.

                       UBERTO
             Where are we?

                       WALT
             Givvem a cigarette...

   Uberto comes out of the car and squints around.

                       UBERTO
             ...they ship our Old Mill from New
             Hampshire?

                       BILL
             They're holding our Old Mill for ransom.

                       UBERTO
             We build it?

                       BILL
             We don't have to build it.

   He shows Uberto the brochure.

                       UBERTO
             We build the fire hut?

   Walt shows Uberto the Firehouse.  Uberto looks through the
   viewfinder.

                       UBERTO (CONT'D)
             We have to lose the window.

                       WALT
             ...we can't lose the wind...

                       UBERTO
                 (pulling out storyboards)
             Then I can't do this shot... you wants
             me to push in -- I can't push in through
             the window... we go back to New
             Hampshire?

                       BILL
             NO, we can't ever go back to New
             Hampshire.

   A pick-up truck with two calves in it stops, the driver seen
   from the back is a farmer smoking a pipe.

                       WALT
             NO, we're gonna stay here.  This is what
             my people died for.  The right to make a
             movie in this town.

   INT. TAVERN INN LOBBY - DAY

   A desk clerk, SCOTT, looks up.  Behind the desk a display of
   several souvenir plates, "Souvenir of Waterford, VT", with a
   picture of the Old Mill on them.  Walt picks one up and hands
   it to Bill.

                       SCOTT
             May I help you?

                       WALT
                 (followed Bill)
             I want to talk to the manager.

   Walt talks into his cell phone as he talks to Scott.

                       SCOTT
             Would you like a room?

                       BILL
             Na, we wanna rent the whole hotel.

                       WALT

             Hello, Tracy, we gotta new town. 
             We're...where are we?

   BEAT.  Bill looks around, sees a sign on a desk.  Consults
   his tourist folder.  As they talk they walk into deserted
   ballroom and play shuffleboard and archery.

                       BILL
                 (carrying Waterford plate)
             Waterford, Vermont.

             nothing...

             Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?

   INT. WALT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

   Walt is talking on a cellphone.  A male P.A. is bringing in
   bags of equipment.  Bill is still sitting perched on a desk,
   typing into his computer.  Uberto is sitting on a couch,
   smoking.

   We see the shuffleboard stick on the desk, and the Old Mill
   plate on the wall.

             build an Old Mill.  They have an Old
             Mill.  Yeah.  It's on a stream -- that's
             where you put a mill.

                       BILL

   Joe is reading an old "Welcome to Waterford" tourist folder. 
   The door to the room opens, and Joe stands, looks inside,

   Inside the room, production boards being carried in,
   blackboards, schedules taped to the wall, sketches of Main
   Street, a large "days till shoot...4" sign.  The Old Mill
   plate is on the desk.

   The PRODUCTION DESIGNER is bent over a worktable, he holds a
   compass and refers to blueprints and a scale model of the
   Firehouse and the Old Mill, which are on the table.

   Walt is holding glossy photographs, and leafs through them as
   the Production Designer talks.  They leaf through
   storyboards.

   We see that Walt is leafing through glossy photos of horses.

             you;

                       BOB
             ...because he wouldn't say that: Look:
                 (flips through the script,
                  reads)
             "Sister, I've just come from a fire. 
             There's some things I want to think
             out..." now, come one, come on... "Leave
             me alone."  a gesture...?  Alright?

   Walt opens a case and extracts his lucky pillow which is
   embroidered "Shoot first.  Ask questions afterward."

             yes, but...

   Joe walks off and exchanges glances with Ann, who lingers
   behind.  She pushes the porch swing and exits.  As it swings,
   Joe watches.



   INT. TRAIN STATION - NIGHT

   Joe enters with his bag.  He stands looking at the long
   poster reading: "Waterford, Home of the Huskies - Division
   Champions - 1971, 1972, 1974, 1975, 1976."

   BEAT.  Joe is looking at the banner when the old
   stationmaster enters.

                       JOE
             What happened in 1973?

   BEAT.  The stationmaster looks around, and leans in to Joe,
   confidentially.

   The DOOR opens.  It is Walt.  The stationmaster retreats. 
   Walt comes forward.

                       WALT
             Don't run off.  Don't run off, we need
             you.  You know why?  You're why we're
             here.  Your script is why we're here...
                 (of bag)
             Gimme that.  Big deal.  We fight a
             little bit? 
             You show me a family that doesn't.  But
             we got something special.  What is it? 
             We're here to make a movie.  Can't use
             the Old Mill.  Well, that happens.  What
             you got to do, you find the essence -
             what was it, that brought us here.  It
             wasn't a building, Joe, it was an idea. 
             It was an essence - what is the essence
             of your story?  Joe?

   PAUSE

                       JOE
             It's about a man who gets a second
             chance.

                       WALT
             Then, you write that.  And then this is
             our second chance.  That's why we're
             here.

   PAUSE

                       JOE
             I want to make a good film.

                       WALT
             I know you do.

                       JOE
             And maybe it will be a better movie
             without the old mill, I...

                       WALT
             Hey, it's with the G-ds.  We don't have
             the money, we have to write it out.  The
             best or not.
                 (shrugs)
             And that's a lesson.  You get your
             typewriter yet?

                       JOE
             Um, no.

   Walt picks up a cell phone, dials.  Lights of train go by
   outside.  Stationmaster enters and calls the train.

                       WALT
                 (into phone)
             Grace, get on the other phone.  Call
             that girl: well, call her, and have
             whatsername send up some nosh...what do
             you like to drink...?

                       JOE
             I don't drink.

                       WALT
             Did my matzohs come?  Get some for
             everybody.
                 (into phone)
             Thank you.
                 (hangs up)
             Lemme tell you about my first movie...

   EXT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

   The production assistant is stapling a casting notice for
   "The Old Mill" half over the notice of the amateur
   theatricals poster.  Doug shows up, looks in the window. 
   Looks at poster, takes it down, looks around.

   ANGLE ON

   The park bench.  Ann, her feet up on the old typewriter, is
   sitting, reading the script.  Doug comes up.

                       DOUG
             What, what what are you doing here?

                       ANN

                       DOUG
             Look at this.  Do you know what they're
             offering?  Look at this.  They treat us
             like we're their backyard.  Do you know
             what they're offering for three days to
             close down Main Street?

                       ANN
             What are they offering?

                       DOUG
             Ten thousand dollars.

                       ANN
             That's so beautiful...

                       DOUG
             I beg your pardon?

   Ann gestures at the script.

                       ANN
             "The mill grinds the grain, but the
             grain is not destroyed.  Although it is
             altered..."

                       DOUG
             Sure, but... ten thousand dollars.  Do
             you know what they... this movie is
             budgeted at fifty million dol...they're
             coming up here, offer us a meal...

   INT. MAYOR'S HOME - DAY

   The Mayor's Wife comes into the room.  Her hands are full of
   lists, giving instructions to a handyman.

                       SHERRY (MAYOR'S WIFE)
             The chairs go, the Lazyboy goes...

                       MAYOR
             ...not the Lazyboy...

   Cal, the policeman, enters, carrying an old spinning wheel.

             Waal, then, invite someone else, then...

                       SHERRY
             I don't want to invite someone else
             because this is the most exclusive...

                       MAYOR
             Waal, then, you know, you do whatever
             would make you happy.  Sher.  This is
             your party, and whatever...

   Doug enters.  Cal exits carrying a pinball machine.

                       CAL
             Hi Doug.

                       DOUG
             Cal.  I want a city council meeting.

                       MAYOR
             ...little woman has gone crazy about our
             dinner party... City Council?  What's
             the trouble?

                       DOUG
             Main Street.

                       MAYOR
                 (sighs)
             Doug, the traffic light...

                       DOUG
             Fuck the traffic light.  I'm talking
             about three percent of the adjusted
             gross of a Major Motion Picture.

   INT. PROD. OFFICE - DAY

   Sign reads THREE DAYS till shoot.

   Walt is on the phone.  Covers the phone.  Crossed sticks on
   the wall, Walt plays with a shuffleboard discus.  Girl P.A.
   brings cup of coffee to Walt.  Her T-shirt reads: "DOES IT
   HAVE TO BE AN OLD MILL?"

                       WALT
                 (to A.D.)
             No, he doesn't want to work out with

             unless he can work out.  Call up his
             girl in Aspen, and have her ship the
             weights out...

   Walt hangs up the phone.  Secretary enters with folders that
   she hands to Walt.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             Who designed these costumes?  Who
             designed these costumes?  It looks like

             I have no wife.

   A P.A. comes in with a big bakery box.  They open it to show
   it is a huge loaf of bread, and on it is written, in bread,
   "Waterford Welcomes The Old Mill."

                       WALT (CONT'D)
                 (calling out)
             We need a new name for the movie.

             Wally, I got to takes out the window
             from the dog.  I can't shoot through...

   CAMERA MOVES on past the production board, where we see
   "Dinner With Mayor" in red.  And the costume designer comes
   up.

                       COSTUME DESIGNER
             ...Claire's got a problem.

                       UBERTO

             look at these storyboards.  THIS SHOOT,
             I can't shoot this shot, you want.

                       WALT
             Why?

                       UBERTO
             Because they gots a window with a dogs
             in it.  You want me to "push in."  Or
             can I lose the shot.

                       WALT
             No you can't lose the shot.  The meaning
             of the film is in that shot.

                       UBERTO
             But, Wally, the window of the firehut...

                       WALT
             I don't care.  Fix it.

   He goes into comfab with the costume designer.

                 (of sketches)
             You show Claire these sketches?

             Yes.

                       WALT
             Did she throw up?

                       COSTUME DESIGNER
             That isn't very nice.

                       WALT
             Oh, really, then why don't you sue me in
             the World Court.  Did she like the
             costumes?

                       COSTUME DESIGNER
             I can't tell.

                       WALT
             Why not?

   She puts his dinner down on the coffee table.  He takes out
   money from his pants to pay her.

             Everybody's gotta eat.  Way of the

   He sits before his dinner, hands her some money.  Remembers
   himself.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
             Well, I'm pretty impolite.  Would you
             like some?

             Bourbon and milk.

                       BOB
             How old are you?

   Carla WHISPERS her age to him.  He makes her a drink out of
   his fridge, hands it to her.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
             Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone I
             gave you this.

                       CARLA
             I wouldn't tell anyone anything that
             happened between me and somebody who was

                       BOB
             Nice town that you've got here.

                       CARLA
             You want to see it better, we could go
             out on the roof.

                       BOB
             ...wouldn't that be dangerous?

                       CARLA
             ...not if you've got something to hold
             on to.

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DUSK

   Joe is walking down the street.  A script in his hand,
   scribbling.  Uberto walks next to him.

                       UBERTO
             Because if you cannot tells me what is
             it, how I, how does I take a pictures of
             it?  Wally wants me, push in through the
             weendow...

   Joe, as he is scribbling in the script.

                       JOE
             Yeah, no, can I...if you'd excuse me,
             I've just got to...

   He walks away and the CAMERA takes him into a backyard, by a
   bunch of clotheslines.  His glasses fall apart as he changes
   them.  He looks up as the wind blows the sheet.

   He sees Ann, sitting on the backstairs of what, as we draw
   closer, we see is the playhouse.  In back of her we see the
   "Trials of the Heart" flats, seen from the back.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

                       ANN
             Hello.

                       JOE
             I thought you had Play Practice.

                       ANN
             Don't look good for "Trial of the
             Heart."

                       JOE
             Well, then, it don't look good for the
             Huskies...

                       ANN
             That's for sure.

   They walk down the street.  As they walk down the street, the
   dog comes over and Annie throws him his bone over her
   shoulder.

                       JOE
             What happened?

                       ANN
             Cast stood me up.

                       JOE
             Uh huh.

                       ANN
             They're all preparing for the auditions -
             your movie.

   He gets an idea, and trades glasses, one pair for the other. 
   He kneels.

             the throne of justice."

                       JOE
             What?

                       ANN
             What are you doing down there?

                       JOE
             My glasses fell apart.  I lost the...

                       ANN
             ...lost the screw...

                       JOE
             You got a paperclip?

   A little kid is walking by, carrying a fishing rod.

                       LITTLE KID
             Evening, Annie.

                       ANN
             Evenin', sweetheart.

                       LITTLE KID
             Go you Huskies.

                       ANN
             You said it.

                       JOE
             You like kids?

                       ANN
             Never saw the point of 'em.

                       JOE
             Me, too.  You have a paperclip?

                       ANN
             Paperclip?

                       JOE
             Fix my glasses.

                       ANN
             Better idea.

   She ducks under the sheet hanging by the door, she and Joe
   come upon the fishergirl, who is standing by the bank about
   to make a cast.

   We see Annie take some leader from the little girl and burn
   one end to make a hinge.

                       JOE
             Gonna be good as new.

                       ANN
             Better'n new, cause it's got a story. 
             Want to do the other part?

   Joe takes the hinge, and a match and tries to fix the hinge,
   and burns his finger.

                       JOE
             Ow.

   He grabs for the nearest object.  PAUSE.

                       ANN
             What?

   Joe shows her.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             Y'know what you got there?  You got a
             fishhook in your finger.

   EXT. BOOKSTORE - DUSK

   Doug standing, holding a bunch of flowers.  The A.D. walks
   by.  Looks in the window.

                       FIRST A.D.
             I'm looking for the writer.

                       DOUG
             What the hell are you so down about?

                       FIRST A.D.
                 (pause)
             My wife's going to have a baby.

                       DOUG
             How about that.

                       FIRST A.D.
             Mmmm.
                 (pause)
             You have children?

                       DOUG
             No.
                 (pause)
             No, but we're planning to.

                       FIRST A.D.
                 (pause)
             Could you tell me where a fellow goes to
             get a drink in this town?

                       DOUG
             Yes.

   INT. WALT'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

   Marty and Walt et al studying various documents.  Claire
   sitting there.

                       MARTY
             I want to tell you something, Wally,
             he's a pussycat.

                       CLAIRE

                 (tentatively)
             Hi!

                       MARTY
                 (on phone)
             You tell me: you tell me now, I've got
             to shoot on Wednesday and I will not pay
             your Blood Money and P.S., pal, I put
             the word out on the street and Betty
             Boop can look for work in

   Claire starts to get up.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
             Siddown!

                       JOE
             I really don't think you should be
             talking this way to a lady.

                       MARTY
             ...would you excuse me, please...

                       CLAIRE
             You can't treat me like this.  I'm not a

   Claire exits, crying.

                       MARTY
                 (his suitcase next to him -
                  into phone)
             Well, you call him, and call me back,
             but this is it, pal.  You fuck with me,
             and I'm going to tear out your heart and

             Where have you been?

                       JOE
             I...

                       MARTY
             He says they're looking for you all day,
             you're on salary, he needs pages, what
             are you, you been 'haying?' Now:

             Marty...

                       MARTY
             Later for that, Walt, let's get this: we

                       BILL
             Rewrites that Bob Barrenger requested...

                       MARTY
             Whatever it is.  Go do it.  How you
             doing on the permit?

                       WALT
             It's just a formality.

                       MARTY
             That's why I want it.
                 (to Joe)
             Type it up and get it back to me in...

                       JOE
             I can't.

                       WALT
             Why?

                       MARTY
             You can't write it?

                       JOE
             I can write it.  I can't type it.

                       WALT
             Why?

                       JOE
             I hurt my fingers.

                       WALT
             Get a typist.  Get'im a typist.  Get
             outta here.

   Joe exits.  They turn to survey the board.

                       MARTY
             Eight-hundred grand to show her tits...

                       WALT
             Pay her.

                       MARTY
             I don't got the money.

                       WALT
             Find the money.

                       MARTY
             I got a company...give us a million
             dollars, put their product in the film.

                       WALT
                 (looking at a paper Marty hands
                  him)
             No no no no no no no no find me the
             money...


   INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

   Joe takes out paper, looks around.  Sighs.  Picks up phone,
   calls back.

                       JOE
                 (into phone)
             This is Joe White... in six ten, they're
             sending up a typist?

   He takes out a sheet of foolscap and a pencil.  Starts to
   write.  A knock at the door.

                       JOE (CONT'D)
                 (into phone)
             Okay, I thank you.  It's here.

   He hangs up the phone, goes to the door, opens it.  It is
   Claire.

                       CLAIRE
             You said, "You can't talk that way to a
             lady..."  You stood up for me.
                 (beat)
             What do you have to drink?

   She looks around, sees a gift basket containing a bottle of
   Stolichnaya and a box of matzoh, wrapped with a "Welcome
   Back" ribbon.

                       CLAIRE (CONT'D)
             Matzoh!  Are you Jewish?

                       JOE
             I, actually, yes.

                       CLAIRE
             I love Jewish men.

                       JOE
             Why?

                       CLAIRE
             You know...where's your bathroom?

   She goes into the bathroom.

                       JOE
             You liked the script, huh...?

   Ann Black sitting on the park bench, holding the lure.

             Where have you been?

   He gives her the bouquet.

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - NIGHT

   Joe is standing by the side of the bed, holding Claire's
   clothes, trying to induce her to put them on.  She is sitting
   on the side of the bed, naked.

   Sound of a KNOCK at the door.

                       JOE (CONT'D)
             Great.  Who is it?

   Ann hurriedly arranging the flowers in the "platen" of the
   typewriter.  From inside the room we hear Joe's voice:
   "Alright, one moment!"  He opens the door.

             I'm gonna be your typist for this

             One moment.

   He closes the door.

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

   Claire is still sitting on the bed, has a lit cigarette. 
   Poured herself a drink.  Joe goes over to her, thrusts her
   clothes on the floor.

                       JOE
             You have to hide.

                       CLAIRE

   Joe hustles back to the door.  Opens the door.  Ann is still
   standing there with the typewriter.

                       JOE
             Hi.

                       ANN
             You going to ask me in?

   Joe looks back over his shoulder.

                       ANN (CONT'D)
             Thought you might like this.

   She hands him a bouquet.

                       ANN
             ...because if you don't, they die.

   She goes into the bathroom, fills up the vase.  Comes out.

             Later on.

   She starts to exit.

   INT. TAVERN INN HALLWAY - NIGHT

   Ann digs in pocket, takes out the lure we previously saw in
   Joe's finger.  She re-enters the room.

   INT. HALL - NIGHT

   Ann puts down the typewriter and types into it, "The truth
   may not always set you free, but it is always the truth -
   Joseph Turner White, 'Anguish.'"  She affixes the lure to it
   and leaves them on the typewriter.  She starts down the hall,
   humming.  Behind her we see the door to Bob Barrenger's room
   open.  Bob comes out, looks down the hall.  The coast is
   clear.  Carla comes out.  They kiss chastely, say goodnight. 
   She starts down the hall, humming.


   EXT. MAYOR'S PORCH - DAY

   The postman walk sup.  We see two workmen putting up a sign
   over the door '1835.'  One has a copy of "The Hollywood
   Reporter" in his back pocket.

             The house, the 1835.  The original

             A spate of suspicious fires which were

                       JACK
             With you inna moment.  I'm a little
             short-handed.

                       MORRIS
             Where's Carla?

   Ann enters.

                       SPUD
             Hiya, Annie...

   A crowd has gathered around the table as he tells the story.

                       MORRIS
             Annie, sorry I ain't been to a meetin'
             of the Drama Club...

   Ann shows a sniped "canceled" poster of her play.

                       MORRIS (CONT'D)
             Oh, good...

   He resumes talking to his companion.

                       ANN
             Good morning to you...whatsa matter?

                       JOE
             I can't get it to come out right.

                       ANN
             What's the scene...

                       JOE
             It used to be the Old Mill.

                       ANN
             What've you got?

                       JOE
             They meet on Main Street.  Her horse has
             just died.  He's coming from the fire.

   He shuffles through his pages, he goes in his pocket for a
   note, he brings out the old lure.  He smiles at her, she
   smiles back.

                       JACK (O.S.)
             Annie, you want something to eat?

                       ANN
             What's the scene about...?

                       JOE
             It's good to see you, too...

                       JACK
             Annie?

                       ANN
             What about...what about...it's so
             presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling
             you how to wr...

                       JOE
             Please...

                       ANN
             How about, he sees her on the street, he
             wipes the soot from his eyes.  He goes
             up to her.  "What happened to the
             horse?"  She looks at him.  She takes
             his hand...

   She takes Joe's hand, and he winces.

                       JOE
             Ah, ah, ah...

                       ANN
             I hurt you?

                       MORRIS
             What happened to his finger?

                       ANN
             It was burnt.

                       MORRIS
             Mmm.

                       ANN
             And then it was really hurt.

                       JOE
             Ah, ah, ah.  That's what she says,
             that's what she says.  He says, "Sister,
             I've come from a fire..."  But she, but
             she, she says it was not the fire which
             hurt you...it...

                       MORRIS
             ...how was it hurt?

                       ANN
             ...he stuck a fishhook in it.
                 (Morris nods)

                       JOE
             She realizes -- it was not the fire
             which hurt him...that the true hurt was
             her.  Was her...

                       ANN
             ...yes.

                       JOE
             ...her unbridled sexuality.  That he...

                       ANN
             ...yes.

                       JOE
             Has been wounded by her heat...by her
             infidelities...

                       JACK
             Anybody here seen Carla?

                       JOE
             Because, because, because if it's about
             purity, it's...it's...and then, then,
             you don't need the nude scene.

                       ANN
             Because it's about purity...

                       JOE
             That's...that's exactly what it's about. 
             Take...

                       ANN
             That's right...

                       JOE
             ...take any two people...

                       JACK
             ...anybody seen my daughter...?

                       JOE

             The movie's about purity.  So we don't
             show her breasts.  We show them to him. 
             She keeps her back to the camera.

                       WALT
             ...she keeps her back to the camera?

                       BILL
             It'll hurt the box-office.

                       JOE
             They know what her tits look like.

   He takes out his cardcase.

   Joe, happy as a clam, sauntering down the street.  Smoking a
   huge cigar.  He passes two old codgers, Morris and Spud.

             too.

   note, fumbles with his glasses.  Joe saunters on, writing, we
   hear the beeping from the traffic light.  Joe hears a
   screeching of tires.

   He looks up, a film station wagon comes barreling around the
   corner, hits the pothole, goes out of control, careens, turns
   over, knocks down the control box of the traffic light.

   Joe holds a beat, runs over to the car, to driver's side.
   Battered driver, bleeding, upside down.  Joe drags him from
   the car.  It is Bob Barrenger.

   Barrenger points to the other side.  Joe looks.

   ANGLE POV

   Carla is the passenger, she is dazed but unhurt.

   ANGLE ON 

   The car.

                       BOB
             We gotta get her out of here.

   Carla has extracted herself from the wreck, stands, woozily,
   on the sidewalk.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
                 (to Carla)
             Are you alright?

   BEAT.  She nods, understanding.  A light comes on in the
   apartment over the store.  She looks up, starts away down the
   street.  BEAT.  Bob rocks back and forth.

                       BOB (CONT'D)
             Oh G-d, oh G-d, oh G-d...do you have a
             cig...

   INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

   Bob is being bandaged by Doc Wilson.  Marty on the phone. 
   Walt, the First A.D., and Joe also in the room.

                       MARTY

                 (to Doc)
             Thank you.

   Doc exits.

                       DOC WILSON
             Yessir...

                 (into phone)
             He's...you wanna talk to...?

   Bob goes over to the phone, his head bandaged.  Walt,
   smoking, stands by the window.

                       BOB
                 (into phone)
             Hello, Jerry.  I'm fine.  I'll be ready

   He hangs up.

                       FIRST A.D.
             Walt, I wonder if I could take a minute
             of your time.  I need a day off...

   There is an abrupt knocking at the door.

                       WALT
             Who is it?

             Thiz the police.  Is Mr. Barrenger in
             there?

   The boys in the room go into a whisper conference.

             Okay, look, you, what is she, 19,
             twenty...oh Christ...

   The knock is repeated.

                       CAL
                 (outside the door)
             Is Mr. Barrenger there...?

                       MARTY
             No, wait a, wait a, wait a...we can't
             put her in the car, she gets it in her

             Joe, the writer?

                       BOB
             Just him and me.

   Knocking was repeated.

                       MARTY
             Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.

                       BOB
             She wasn't in the...

                       MARTY

                 (beat, each nods)
             Because it's sink or swim here, pals...

   They murmur their assent.  Knocking is repeated.  Walt goes
   to the door.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
                 (to First A.D. and Joe)

                       CAL
             Mr. Barrenger...

   Marty ushers Joe and the First A.D. out the room.

                       MARTY
             Yes...?

   The cop comes in the room.

                       CAL
             I'm very sorry to...

                       MARTY

   Bob gestures to his wallet which is on the desk.

             And who was driving the...

                       BOB
             I was alone in the car.  I was driving.

   The cop is writing down these statements.

                       CAL
             Well, now, Mr. Barrenger, I'm very
             sorry, in fact, I'm as sorry as I could
             be, but...

                       MARTY
             I'm an attorney, if there's anything you
             have to say to...

                       CAL
             ...I have to give you this ticket for

                 (beat)
             You have to what?

   Cal reaches in back of him, on his belt, and takes out not
   the cuffs, but the summons book, he starts to write a
   summons.

                       CAL
             It's a formality.  Any case of damage to
             city prop...you hit the control box of

                 (apologetically he hands the
                  ticket to Bob)
             They'll, uh, these things happen, I hope
             you're alright, and that you're

   Marty walks him out into the hall.  Photographers and
   onlookers in the hall.  Phone rings.  Walt answers it.

             Yeah.  Hello, Mr. Mayor...Walt Price!

   Door to hall opens.  Claire comes in.

   EXT. FIRESTATION TO PRINTSHOP - NIGHT

   The firetruck is being backed into the firestation.  Outside
   a couple of passerbys are running in the rain, putting their
   collars up.

   We see Joe is in the firestation writing in his book.  As the
   firetruck backs up we see the firedog bark, and Joe looks up.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

   Ann is walking past the firestation.  Joe comes out to look
   at her.

             Going home.

   They start to walk down the street in the rain.

                       JOE
             Going home, yeah.  I told them what you
             said...

             No, that's true.

                       JOE
             No.  You, I told them, you can't betray
             with the picture what you're saying with
             the words.  And, I don't know, the

   Joe looks in the window of the printshop.

             I told them what you said about the
             script...

             key back at my store...

                       JOE
             I'd love to.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, runs out into the rain, Joe runs along side her.  In the
   b.g., we see the fireman closing the doors of the firehouse,
   and the firedog being restrained, on a leash, by him and shut
   up inside the firehouse.

   with the other. 

   She hands him some plans, which show photos of the old
   printshop, and copies of the Old Waterford Sentinel, circa
   1900.

   She cannot find a dog biscuit.

   puts him out.  The door blows in the rain.

   looks around, and goes back to a window, and shuts the
   window.

   Ann crosses to her desk.  Takes out a box of dog biscuits. 
   The box is empty.  The two of them lead the dog out, and pet

             Bear with me, now -- because what're we

             She went to fetch a pail of water.

   Carla goes out the door.

                 (to merchant)
             You see what I'm saying, take this
             opportunity to mount an investigation of
             the price of school textbooks.  Bear
             with me now: both the cost, and the

             Well, Joe said it, and he's right.

   Knock at the door.  Marty goes to the door.

             You doin' here, Doug?  Thought you

             Kiss my ass.

             Well.

             He had a hard day.  Ann's deserted him
             for some guy on the movie.

                       DOC WILSON
             Well, they don't always leave with the
             ones they came in with.

             Big day last night.

                       DOC WILSON

             in my eyes: I made eleven million bucks
             last year and I don't like being trifled
             with.  Now I think that the better part
             of valor, though we've got your back up
             here...the better part of valor is to
             step away.  Or, before G-d, I will see

   They walk down the hall.  Before them, Claire, half-clothed,

   Marty is perusing the lawbooks.

             That we could use you in and I think

             a... even if this was true, you need a
             witness.  You need someone puts her in
             the car.  And you've got nothing.  Now
             we all have...yes, give her that part in
             the film.
                 (to Carla)
             Yes, we'd love to have you... Now: we
             all have more important things to do,
             isn't that right...?

   Marty starts ushering everyone out of the room.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
             Isn't that right?  I'm sorry that you
             all went to this...

                       JACK
             I knew she wasn't in the car.

                       MARTY
             This has been just an unfortunate.

   He ushers them out, the phone is ringing.  Walt picks it up.

                       WALT
                 (into phone)
             Yes?  Hello, Mr. Mayor.  Nothing, just
             an, an unfortunate...
                 (he covers the phone)
             It's the Mayor, he's saying...

                       MARTY
             Is he cool or angry?

   INT. MAYOR'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

   Mayor on the phone.  Sherry in the b.g.

                       MAYOR
             Well, these things happen.  Purpose of
             my call, my wife wanted to know what
             brand of cigarettes Mr. Barrenger
             smokes, so she could lay some out
             tonight...we got the list of his dietary
             requirements...
					  

   INT. PROD. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

                 (hangs up phone)
             So we just got lucky.

                       BILL
             Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast.  He
             needs your confirmation on a request for
             money...?

                       MARTY
             And I need a drink.

   Marty exits.

                       WALT
                 (to Bob)
             If your memory was as long as your dick,
             you'd be in good shape.  How long since
             you almost went to jail for this shit?

                       BOB
             How could she turn on me like that?  I
             thought she liked me.

                       WALT
             Can we try to keep our pants buttoned
             and get out of this town in one piece?

                       BOB
             I'm ready!

                       WALT
             Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your
             room.

                       BOB
             What'll I do for fun?

                       MARTY
             Whyn't you learn your lines?

                       BOB
             I know my lines...

                       WALT
             You do...?

                       BOB
             I just don't know what order they come
             in...

   Walt walks away from Bob, shaking his head.

   ANGLE ON

   Walt, as he walks down the stairs.

                       WALT
             I tell you what, let's ditch these
             cockamamie locals.  I need to get outta
             here.  Go to some roadhouse tonight,
             just us.  Claire, Bob, siddown, have a
             bottle of wine.  Tell me where we're
             going, and let's go.

   They walk by the bullpen, wherein we see P.A.s refilling
   Evian bottles from a ratty old watering can.

   P.A.s take us, with their Evian bottles, into Walt's office,
   where we see the "Dinner with the Mayor" sign.

   INT. MAYOR'S HOME - NIGHT

   Twelve overdressed people, including the Postman, the
   Gunstore Owner, etc. sitting, still around the Mayor's laden
   dining table.  BEAT.  Sherry looks over her shoulder.

   ANGLE ON

   Next room, the Mayor on the phone.  Hushed.

                       MAYOR
             Well, you must, where did they...
             where...I...

   PAUSE

   Very angry, he HANGS UP and looks out the window.

   ANGLE POV

   The Mayor lets the shade drop, walks back to the table. 
   Silence.

   INT. BAR - NIGHT

   Doug, in his cups, at the end of the bar with the First A.D.

                       DOUG
             Hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...

                       FIRST A.D.
             My wife just went into labor...

   The bartender studies his state statutes book.

   BARTENDER'S POV

   Inside the book, the storyboards show the movie's heroes
   copulating.

                       DOUG
             Half a buck I'd close it down.  It's
             per...you know...it's perfidy, you got
             your Barrenger, molesting little girls.

                       FIRST A.D.
             He should be put in jail.

                       DOUG
             Half a buck I'd put him in jail.

                       FIRST A.D.
             You should.

                       DOUG
             I had a witness, I would.

                       FIRST A.D.
             A witness to what?

                       DOUG
             You know, the rape, to...even to the
             accident.

                       FIRST A.D.
             You mean with White?

                       DOUG
             What?

                       FIRST A.D.
             You mean you need a witness in addition
             to White?

                       DOUG
             Who's White?

                       FIRST A.D.
             The writer.

                       DOUG
                 (beat)
             He saw the accident...?

                       FIRST A.D.
             Sure.

                       DOUG
             He saw the girl in the car...

                       FIRST A.D.
             You bet he did.

   INT. MAYOR'S HOME - NIGHT

   The Mayor and his wife alone at the table.  The maid emptying
   trays of food, untouched, into a galvanized steel garbage
   pail placed in the middle of the room.  One of the guests
   leaving, putting on her coat.  Dips back into the dining room
   to try to pick up a tray of pate.

                       SHERRY
             Don't you touch that... I want them
             gone.

                       MAYOR
             I signed the permit.  I don't know how I
             can.

                       SHERRY
             I want them thrown in jail.

                       MAYOR
             Sherry, Sherry...

   She empties it into the trash.  BEAT.  The guest, chagrined,
   leaves.  The Mayor, sitting and drinking booze out of a large
   glass.  The phone RINGS.  BEAT.  He goes to answer it.

                       MAYOR (CONT'D)
                 (into phone)
             What?
                 (he jiggles the receiver)
             Get me the State Police.

   EXT. PRINT SHOP - DAY

   A sign in the window, "Sold" is stamped over and reads "Under
   Agreement."

   Early summer morning.  Joe, holding a cup of coffee, looking
   at the print shop.  Ann walks up.

                       JOE
             Good morning.

                       ANN
             Sleep well?

                       JOE
             Yeah, you?

                       ANN
             Oh yeah...

                       JOE
             We could live up here, live up in the
             country.

                       ANN
             Now you're talking...

                       JOE
             And we could get up every morning...

                       ANN
             ...well, we do that anyway...

                       JOE
             And come to the printshop.  You know
             why?

                       JOE (CONT'D)
             To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to
             write.  To write.  To write.  Right here
             in the office.

                       ANN
             Not without a rolltop desk.

                       JOE
             Well, I could get a rolltop desk.

                       ANN
             Happen to know where there's one for
             sale.

                       JOE
             Well ain't you amazing.

   They walk on, onto the scene of various filmfolk setting up.

   EXT. STATE AND MAIN - INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS

                       ANN
             Lookit that, up already.

                       JOE
             That's why we filmfolk get along so well
             with you farmers.  Both up with the
             chickens.

   They push through the mass.  The street is closed off by
   Police Cars.

   They come upon a TV REPORTER doing a standup in front of the
   firehouse where we see, in front, both the old firetruck and
   state trooper cars.

                       TV REPORTER
             Where Movie Star Bob Barrenger, fresh
             from his troubles with the law last
             year...

   ANGLE ON

   Ann and Joe, as they look on.

   ANGLE ON

   A state trooper and Doug, as they walk through the crowd. 
   Marty walks up to the TV REPORTER.

                       TV REPORTER (CONT'D)
             ...is once again in hot water.  Involved
             in a car crash last night with a young,
             a very young woman, Mr. Barrenger is
             being arrested today for...

                       MARTY
             You better make sure you got your facts
             straight, pal, cause, you step off the
             line and I'm going to sue you personally
             for...

   The trooper, Doug, and Bob Barrenger walk up to Marty.

                       TROOPER
             We're looking for a Joseph Turner White.

                       MARTY
             Oh, good, yes.  Good morning.  Where are
             you taking Mr. Barrenger?

                       TROOPER
             We are looking for a Mr. Joseph Turner
             White?

                       MARTY
             What are you doing with Mr. Barrenger?

                       DOUG
             He's under arrest.

   Doug hands the arrest warrant to Marty.

                       MARTY
             Oh, good.  I'm his lawyer...and you must
             be Perry Mason.  Guess what, you're
             about one-half step from a world of
             hurt...how diverting...the Mayor's gonna
             have your ass.  Can I watch?

   CAMERA takes the group, the trooper, Doug, Bob, in handcuffs,
   Marty talking with them, through the crowd, on the back of
   which we see Ann and Joe.

                       DOUG
             Well, you guess what.  The Mayor sent
             me.  I have your Mr. Barrenger with a
             history of...

                       MARTY
             ...a history of nothing, he was
             acquitted.

                       DOUG
             Moral turp...you're on my home court,
             friend.  I have the Mayor and the town
             behind me, and forget making your movie:
             I may own the studio when I get through
             with you: I got a civil suit, I got
             rape, I got collusion...

                       MARTY
             You've got nothing, you don't have a
             witness...

                       DOUG
             And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White
             saw the crime.

                       MARTY
             He told you that!?

                       DOUG
             He didn't have to tell.

                       MARTY
             I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...

                       DOUG
             Oh, you're his attorney, too?

                       MARTY
             Later for you, pal.

                       DOUG
             Okay.

   He motions the cop to take out Barrenger.  Marty sees Joe in
   the back.

                       MARTY
             Bobby, don't say anything.

                       BOB
             Nothing happened.

                       DOUG
             We'll see about that at the inquest.

   ANGLE ON

   Marty, as he leads Joe down into an alleyway, and into a
   backyard, hung with washing on the lines.

                       MARTY
             Yeah, hi, pal.  I need to talk to you.
					 
					  
   INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY

   Ann, Joe and Marty.  Cal has followed them into the
   bookstore.  He speaks privately with Ann and exits.

                       ANN
             What is it all about?

                       JOE
             I saw...

                       MARTY
             How do they know that, you told them?

                       JOE
             No.

                       MARTY
             What did you say to them?

                       JOE
             I didn't say anything to them.

                       MARTY
             How do you know you saw it?

                       JOE
             I don't know.

                       MARTY
             Well, then, you didn't see it, right?

                       JOE
             I don't...

                       MARTY
             You didn't see it...

                       JOE
             I...?  I saw it.  I was there.

                       MARTY
             You were there.  At...at 10:35...?

   Joe takes the arrest warrant.  Looks at it.  Changes his
   glasses.

                       JOE
                 (as he reads)
             I was walking down the street...I
             remember, I was writing a...

                       MARTY
             What glasses were you wearing?
                 (pause)
             Were you wearing your reading glasses?

                       JOE
             I...

                       MARTY
             You told me you were writing.  Don't you
             wear your reading glasses to write...?

   Marty's cellphone rings and he answers it.  After a pause, he
   hangs up.

                       MARTY (CONT'D)
             I've got to go to the jail.

   He exits, leaving Walt alone with Ann and Joe.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann.  She sees something down the other street.  We see Cal,
   the policeman, enter and start toward Joe.  We see Ann
   restrain him, and speak to him in the b.g. for several
   moments.  He shakes his head, and she reasons with him, and
   there is a pause and he looks at Joe, and exits.

   BEAT

                       ANN
             ...he's going to give you a couple of
             minutes.

   PAUSE

   Joe walks Ann off to the closed back door of "The Waterford
   Players."

                       JOE
             What am I gonna do?

                       ANN
             You got to tell 'em that you saw the
             accident.  Don't you?

                       JOE
             I can't do that.
                 (pause)
             If I tell them, they'll, if I tell them,
             they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...
             it'll ruin his career...

                       ANN
             But that's what happened.

                       JOE
             But it'll stop the movie.

                       ANN
             Maybe they'll be other movies.

                       JOE
             They'll...they'll blackball me.

                       ANN
             Carla was in the car, right?

                       JOE
             I...I think that's right.

                       ANN
             ...you think that's right...

   PAUSE

                       JOE
             What'm I gonna do?

   Ann picks up a copy of the old Waterford Sentinel, which was
   left on the coffee table.  Ann hands the paper to Joe.

   ANGLE ON

   Joe, holding the paper.

   ANGLE INS.

   The masthead reads, "Waterford Sentinel, All the News of the
   Mountains, 'You Shall Not Bear False  Witness.'"

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, who has also picked up the "For Sale" sign, showing the
   printshop.  She stands looking at Joe.  BEAT.  Cal enters. 
   They look towards him.

                       CAL
             Lotta hubbub on the street.  I'm taking
             you the back way.


   EXT. BACKYARD OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY

   Cal walks with Joe, still holding the newspaper.  As they
   round a housecorner, Walt appears and walks with Joe.

                       WALT
                 (checks watch)
             Let's speak English.  You've got to help
             the side.

                       JOE
             You want me to lie.

                       WALT
             To the contrary.  I want you to tell the
             truth.
                 (pause)
             The truth is, you can't tell me, to a
             certainty, that you saw the thing.  You
             don't remember, a gun to your head,
             which glasses you have on.  And you have
             a fertile imagination.  Imagination
             wants to fill in the blanks.  Now.  IF
             you aren't sure, then they have nothing. 
             Bob walks free.  As he should.
                 (pause)
             Joe: wasn't long ago they buried actors
             at the crossroads with a stake through
             their heart, you know?  The people who
             are talking to you about the way we live
             though we may praise them, we fear them. 
             And they fear us.  Because we tell the
             truth.  About our lives.  Now, this is a
             damn roost, and everyone knows it;
             the guy is looking for a case, he wants
             to make a name for himself...If we let
             him do that, if we let him do that, then
             we're being false to our community...to
             our community, you understand?  To our
             world.  Cause you are a part of that
             world, now.  You have to take off the
             steel Rolex and put on the Gold Rolex.
                 (pause)
             And be part of your world.  I got a five
             picture deal with the studio.  And you
             stick with me.  You write one, two more,
             you stick with me, and you'll direct the
             third one.  You are a part of this
             world.  You have to do the right thing:
             we're out in the Provinces, the Sheriff,
             literally is at our door.  You have to
             stand with the troops, Joe.  That's the
             bottom line.  You have to...if you had
             the leisure to think it through, you'd
             see it for yourself.  The girl wasn't in
             the car.

   Cal takes Joe to a side door of the courthouse.

   INT. SMALL COURTROOM - DAY

   Joe coming in through the side entrance of the courtroom. 
   Various law books and dusty forms on the shelves.  Cal leads
   him into the courtroom, empty, save for the court reporter,
   Maude and the BAILIFF.  Cal motions Joe forward.

                       CAL
             ...Joseph Turner White...

                       BAILIFF

             Flynn presiding.  All those having
             business before this court, draw forward
             and you will be heard.

   Judge enters.

                       BAILIFF (CONT'D)
             All rise.

                       JUDGE
             Please...Mr. White?  This is a simple
             matter of...

   Scott hands him a sheet of paper.

                       JUDGE (CONT'D)
             Uh huh, all we need's a simple fact or
             to...you're going to give your
             recollection of the accident last
             evening, at the corner, State and Main. 
             Would you please swear him in.

                       BAILIFF
             Do you swear to tell the truth...

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

   A crowd, moving along, with the TV Reporter.

                       TV REPORTER
                 (talking into camera)
             ...the arraignment, as we said of Bob
             Barrenger, The Bob Barrenger, star of
             "The Old Mill," about to begin shooting
             here, in picaresque and sleepy...
                 (sound of shouting, and
                  reporter looks around)
             we should say, formerly sleepy...Yes,
             yes, it's...yes, it's Claire Wellesley,
             and we're going to try to get a look
             at...

   The crowd moves away, revealing Ann, standing in front of the
   realtors, looking at a card in her hand.  She looks up to see
   Joe coming toward her.
			
			

   ANGLE ON

   Extreme close up, she smiles.

   ANGLE ON

   Extreme close up, Joe.  He looks toward Ann, sheepishly.

   ANGLE BACK ON

   Ann, as she looks down at the card in her hands.

   ANGLE INSERT

   It is the real estate placard for the printshop, marked
   "under agreement."

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, as she rips it up.

   INT. LOBBY OF THE HOTEL - DAY

   Joe, coming in, a hangdog look on his face.

                       P.A.
                 (to Joe)
             They need those rewrites on the "Old
             Mill" scene...

   Joe nods.  Continues through the lobby.

   ANGLE ON

   Various reporters, Scott being interviewed.

                       SCOTT
             ...about his personal life, though I can
             tell you a few things about...

   Joe walks past.

                       JOE
             Would you please hold all calls to my
             room?

                       SCOTT
             Though I can tell you a few things about
             his dietary requirements.

   The old bellhop is packing up his lunchbox and changing into
   his streetclothes.

   INT. JOE'S ROOM - DAY

   Joe enters and takes out his pad and pencil.  He sits on the
   bed.  On the pillow, he sees and picks up a black and red
   hunting jacket, onto which the one foot short sleeve has been
   knitted in baby blue.  There is a card in the picket that
   reads "Better than new -- it's got a story!"  He puts it
   down.

   He picks up his notebook, in which he has written: "The
   Purpose of the Second Chance is to allow you to make the same
   mistake twice."

   He stops by the mirror on the chiffonier into which he puts
   the lure, which still has the attached card reading "The
   truth may not always set you free, but it's always the truth 
   - Joseph Turner White."

   Joe goes to the bed.  On the bed is a small package tied with
   ribbon.  Joe opens it.

   ANGLE INS.

   It is a small thing of maple syrup.  Attached to it is a card
   reading: "It is your invention which makes everything sweet."

   He takes off his jacket, and picks up his notebook.  Out of
   his jacket pocket falls the old copy of the Waterford
   Sentinel.

   He picks it up.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

   The masthead: Waterford Sentinel "The Voice of the Mountains,
   You Shall Not Bear False Witness."

   He puts the newspaper down.  Picks up the maple sugar card
   again, and looks at it.

   He sees an arrow and turns it over

   ANGLE INS.

   The back of the card reads: "How about an Associate Producer
   credit...?"

   He takes the paper, balls it up and throws them into the
   trash.  He picks up the fishing lure which is resting on the
   typewriter.  Puts it into his pocket, thinks again, throws it
   in the trash.  Shakes his head, and picks up his suitcase and
   starts packing...

   EXT. ANN'S STREET - DAY

   On Doc Wilson, as he walks down the street.  A little kid, on
   a scooter is going in the other direction.

                       KID ON SCOOTER
             Mornin', Doc.

                       DOC WILSON
             Mornin', Billy, where ya goin' in such a
             hurry?

                       KID ON SCOOTER
             Down the corner, see the ruckus...

                       DOC WILSON
             Watch the curbs, now...

   ANGLE ON

   Joe, as he stands across from Ann's house, looking at it.  He
   holds his suitcase.

                       DOC WILSON (CONT'D)
                 (of his suitcase)
             Where you off to?

                       JOE
             I, uh...I'm leaving...

                       DOC WILSON
             Why?

                       JOE
             I perjured myself.
                 (pause)
             I told a lie, and I ruined my life. 
             That's what I did.  
                 (shrugs)
             I don't suppose you could help me with
             that, could you?  Turn back the clock,
             or something?  Give me back my, give me
             back my purity, I don't suppose you
             could just wave your magic wand and do
             that, could you?  But what is truth? 
             Eh?  Ain't that the thing?  What is
             true?

                       DOC WILSON
             It's the truth that you should never
             trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  Cravat's
             s'posed to point down to accentuate the
             genitals, why'd you wanna trust
             somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate
             his ears?

   Joe turns to see Doc swigging from his flask.  In the b.g.,
   we see the bellhop walking.

   BEAT

                       JOE
             Aren't you supposed to set an example
             for people?

                       DOC WILSON
             Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold
             people's hands while they die.  What'd
             you say your problem was?

                       JOE
             I just swore my life away, back in
             that...

                       DOC WILSON
                 (as he sees an older woman off
                  on a porch to the side)
             Mornin', Chessy, how's the back?

   Doc walks off to his office.

   EXT. RAILROAD STATION - DAY

                       JOE
             I ruined my life.  Isn't that funny,
             that you can actually do it in one
             moment just like they say.  I ruined my
             life back in that courthouse.

   Bellhop, who has walked up beside him...

                       BELLHOP
             What courthouse?

                       JOE
             Courthouse back in town.

                       BELLHOP
             Town ain't got no courthouse.

                       JOE
             What?

                       BELLHOP
             Ain't got no courthouse.  Courthouse
             burnt down, 1960.

   The train is arriving.  The stationmaster puts out the steps
   to help the people down.

                       JOE
             Well, where do they hold court?

                       BELLHOP
             Hold court, they have to, science lab,
             the high school.

   An ELDERLY LOOKING JUDGE FELLOW descends from the train,
   followed by the CADDY with his golf bag.

                       STATION MASTER
             Mornin', judge, what brings you here?

                       JUDGE
             I'm s'posed to hear some deposition,
             some fool saw the accident last night.

                       JOE
             ...the courthouse burnt down...?

                       STATION MASTER
             Yep.  Courthouse burnt down, 1960.  Part
             of a spate of fires, Old Mill,
             Courthouse... S'posed to've been set by
             some deranged teenager.

   Joe looks around.

   ANGLE JOE'S POV

   The old bellhop walking down the tracks.

   ANGLE ON 

   Joe, as he turns back into town.

   ANGLE CLOSE UP

   On the Station Master.

                       STATION MASTER (CONT'D)
             Yep, never did discover who set 'em...

   He smiles, and lights his cigar.

   EXT. COURT HOUSE BUILDING - DAY

   We see the crowd has moved down the street and the
   "Courthouse" building is empty.

   INT. COURT HOUSE BUILDING - DAY

   Joe enters, and the camera takes him into the deserted
   building, through the courtroom and, in back, he sees Ann
   standing alone.  He walks back to her, through the doors
   which appear to be the Judge's chambers.

   ANGLE REVERSED

   We show that the walls of the Courtroom are the set, and we
   are back in the "Trials of the Heart" set.  Ann is sitting
   there.  Reading her play by Joe White.  He looks at her for
   an explanation.  Maude, the court reporter woman, is sitting
   in the b.g.  Ann is knitting in pink wool.

                       ANN
             I thought you needed to get it out of
             your system.

   Ann moves to embrace Joe.  They hear screaming.  They turn.

   EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

   ANGLE THEIR POV

   At the end of the alleyway, in Main Street.  We see Sherry,
   the Mayor's wife, leading a crowd.

                       SHERRY
             ...a blight, a blight and an
             obscenity...that's good English, isn't
             it?  How's that for entertainment?

   ANGLE

   At the mouth of the alleyway, on Main Street.  We see:

   ANGLE INS.

   The baseball on which is written "To Chucky from your best
   friend, Bob Barrenger."

   ANGLE XCU

   The distorted face of Chucky, heaving the baseball.

   ANGLE ON

   Bob Barrenger being led through the crowd, a baseball hitting
   him in the back of the head, as troopers hustle him toward
   the courthouse.  In the b.g., Ann and Joe emerging in the
   alleyway.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann and Joe, who starts to cross the street.  We see the
   airport van.

                       ANN
             What are you going to do?

                       JOE
             I'm going to tell the truth.

   They start to cross the street.  In the b.g., a little man
   with a bag (HOWIE) gets out of the airport van.  Joe and Ann
   walk toward the crowd at the mouth end of the high school.

   INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

   A crowd of people, TV technicians, and a view of Doug on a TV
   monitor.

                       DOUG
             ...and to exterminate this vermin, yes,
             I use that term, who have abused, who

             ...who spew filth and degradation...
                 (begins to wipe his head)

   As he does so, a makeup person comes in and sponges him.

                       DOUG (CONT'D)
             ...thank you...

                       TV REPORTER

   ANGLE ON

   Doug, seen "live" in the next room, starting to wipe his
   brow.

                       DOUG
             Yes, thank you.

   ANGLE ON

   Marty and Walt watching Doug, as he walks down the hall.

             Five minutes, and we're going live to
             the network.

                 (to himself)
             ...foreign, and un-American perversions

   ANGLE ON

   Marty and Walt, looking on.

                       WALT
             Do something.

                       MARTY
             You tell me what to do, I'll do it.

   They look on to the preparations for the TV.

                       WALT
             ...and I was just paying off my house in
             Malibu...

   Ann and Joe push through the crowd.

                       WALT (CONT'D)
             Thank G-d, it's up to you, Pal.  Sup to
             you...

                       JOE
             The girl was in the car.

                       WALT
             I treated you like a son or nephew.

                       JOE
             It's no you, it's...

                       WALT
             No, what is it?

                       JOE
             I have to tell the truth.

                       WALT
             ...that's just so narrow...

                       JOE
             The girl was in the car.

                       WALT
             Then you're finished in show business.

                       JOE
             So be it.

                       WALT
             And my company sues your ass for sixty
             million dollars.

                       JOE
             For what cause?

                       WALT
             I don't need a cause, just a lawyer.

   HOWIE GOLD shows up holding his bag.

                       HOWIE
             I'm a lawyer.

                       MARTY
             Howie...

                       HOWIE
             Yeah?

                       MARTY
             What are you doing here?

                       HOWIE
             What am I doing here is I just flew
             seven hours cause you asked me here.

                       WALT
             What for?

                       HOWIE
                 (presenting the bag)
             For this...I hope you need it, cause
             it's coming outta your budget...

   INT. LAVATORY HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

   Doug is mopping his face up.  He looks up.  Marty is standing
   there.

                       MARTY
             Hi.

                       DOUG
             I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.

                       MARTY
             I....

                       DOUG
             ...you know, there's nothing you could
             say, that could possibly make a
             difference, so, why don't you just save
             your breath...

   Marty puts the case up on the washstand.

                       DOUG (CONT'D)
             What's in the case?

                       MARTY
             Eight-hundred thousand dollars in cash.

   PAUSE

   INT. HIGH SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY

   Ann and Joe passing through.  They stop and Joe comes up to a
   State Trooper.  As we press forward the Mob begins to reverse
   direction and passes back towards Joe.  Leaving the Hall
   empty, save for the Judge who comes out, putting his robs
   into his golf bag.

                       JOE
                 (to Judge)
             I've come to give myself up...

                       JUDGE
             Well give yourself up to someone else. 
             I'm gonna get in some golf.  Hiya,
             Annie.  Give yourself up to her.

   And we see Joe has moved up to the TV monitor, where we see
   Doug, in the Science Lab, talking to the press, and holding
   his money bag in his arms.

                       DOUG
             I have learned a lesson.  And the lesson
             is this...that everybody needs a second
             chance.  You, me, and these fine, film
             people here.  You know, they have a high
             profile, but that doesn't mean they
             aren't deserving of our trust, and of
             our respect. 
             You know, I think there is a lesson
             here, and the lesson is this: it is a
             lesson of Tolerance...and, as we look at
             this industry, at this clean, American
             industry, and as I begin my campaign for
             congress...

   ANGLE ON

   Ann.  As she, holding the placard starts to cross the street. 
   An old farmer smoking a pipe, driving a pick up is stopped by
   a P.A. talking on a walkie.

   We see that it is the "Judge" who listened to Walt's
   testimony.  Ann waves to him, and proceeds to the Old
   Firehouse, where they are about to make a movie...

                       FIRST A.D.
             Okay, this is picture...

   Ann stops at the back of the crowd of onlookers.  She waves
   to someone.

   ANGLE ANN'S POV

   It is Joe, sitting near the director, who waves back.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, who is next to Cal, the policeman, now in leather jacket
   and leaning on his Harley motorcycle.

             Mornin', Harry.  Heard you had a little
             fire last night.

   hotel, etc.

   ANGLE ON

   Crew, and the film within the film.  We see the lively stable
   across the way.  On its side are painted various ads.  Among
   them, one which says: "Stefan P. Bazoomercom" and Marty is
   standing next to it.  Looking on at the scene being filmed.

   An A.D. brings him a cup of coffee.  The A.D. is passing out
   pink bubblegum cigars, the bands of which read "It's a Girl!"

   ANGLE ON

   Film within the film, the group at the camera watching,
   transfixed.

                       SISTER
             ...to come by next Sunday, and we'll
             give you a second chance.

                       BOB
             Only second chance I know, chance t'make
             the same mistake twice.

                       SISTER
             Well, time will tell.

   She walks past the "Bazoomer.com" ad.

             That's a cut!

   ANGLE ON

   Ann and Cal, as they talk, the firedog comes over and Ann
   gives him a biscuit.  In the b.g., we see the man with the
   pipe get into his pickup and drive off.  The Postman goes off
   continuing his rounds.

   ANGLE ON 

   Ann and Cal as they talk.  Next to them Morris and Spud
   congratulate each other.  Next to them, we see the fake judge
   and the bailiff.

             Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.

                       ANN
             I'll be there.

             You bet your life.

   ANGLE ON 

   Joe, as he looks over at Ann and smiles.

   ANGLE ON

   Ann, giving him a "thumbs up" sign as the Firedog comes and
   sits next to her.  In the b.g., we see the pickup hit the
   pothole and bounce.

          1    EXT.   ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING
          
               A strip of two-lane highway runs through a tall pine forest. There
               is a truck-stop coffee shop beside the roadway. A few 14-WHEELERS
               are scattered across the big dusty parking lot. Morning sunlight
               glints off their chrome stacks. It bakes the asphalt and warms the
               mangy hides of stray DOGS asleep in the dirt. A HELICOPTER hovers
               about the treetops like a lazy hummingbird. It's the beginning of a
               perfect day.
          
               A highway PATROL CAR slowly trolls among the trucks and dogs and
               parks beside the slat and shingled building.
          
               TWO TELEPHONE LINEMEN are scaling a power pole at the forest's edge.
          
          2    POWER POLE - ANGLE ON TELEPHONE LINEMEN
          
               High on the pole, the linemen lean back against their safety straps
               to work, their bodies forming a "Y." One of them suddenly turns,
               pointing at a nearby treetop.
          
                                              FIRST LINEMAN
                                   Lookee there!
          
               He grabs a PORCELAIN INSULATOR from his belt, cocks his arm and
               hurls it across the open stretch. It lands smack in the middle of
               the tree. SQUAWK! A rattle of leaves, a rustle of feathers and a
               HUGE BUZZARD comes flapping out. The lineman cackles over his
               marksmanship.
          
          3    CLOSE ANGLE ON BUZZARD - MOVING SHOT
          
               The big, frightened beady-eyed bird is lumbering through the sky,
               flapping for its life and suddenly...SPLAT! It crashes head-on into
          3A   the bubble of the passing HELICOPTER.

               The ship rocks as the PILOT wrestles the controls. There are THREE
               OTHERS in the cabin. The man beside the pilot, ELI CROSS, is
               sketching in a manuscript and eating an apple. He glances up in
               irritation.
          
                                              ELI

                                  goddamn crazy bird! It tried to
                                  kill us!

                                  Oh yeah, that's your story. What's
                                  the bird got to say about it?
          
              Eli bites into his apple, grimacing at the mushy mouthful    He tosses
              it out the hatch.
          
          5   EXT.   FOREST - TREETOPS
          
              The apple drops into the trees, bounces down from branch to branch
              and falls on the slanted roof of the ROADSIDE DINER beneath. It
              rolls down the eaves, off the edge and lands on top of the parked
              Highway Patrol car.

                                  this guy Cameron.
          
              They climb out as we see a SECOND PATROL CAR sliding up behind them.
              MORE POLICEMEN emerge from the second car.
          
          7   EXT.   DINER - ON POLICEMEN
          
              They huddle, then move toward the diner entrance.     As they pass an

              A FRY COOK serves behind the long counter where MEN on stools eat
              watching the overhead TV. There is a PINBALL MACHINE in action.
              The policemen are seen ENTERING b.g. A TRUCK DRIVER ambles up and
              straddles a stool.

              The fry cook fills the driver's empty water glass from a pitcher,
              then move down the counter.

               He sits a few stools away. He's about 25, even-featured, bone-
               weary. His appealing face needs a shave. The cook fills his water
               glass. The ice cubes rattle as Cameron's hand trembles. His eyes
               are riveted on the policemen.
          
          10   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Two policemen take seats at a booth across from the counter; one
               policeman moves to a WALL TELEPHONE, another stands near the CASH
               REGISTER looking at a magazine. They seem nonchalant, but are
               placed to block all avenues of escape.

               Suddenly startled as someone slaps him on the arm.       He whirls to

               The MAN is staring at the TATOO which shows below the rolled-up
               sleeve of Cameron's shirt, a large American Eagle with elaborate
               scrollwork and a patriotic slogan. The man pulls up his own sleeve
               to show a small tatoo of an anchor.

                                  yours -- that's some eagle...like a
                                  billboard.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                      (eyes on police)
                                  Yeah, that's the grand old bird.
                                     (a half-smile)
                                  Right now I just wish the son-of-a-
                                  bitch could fly.
          
               Cameron rises and moves across the diner to the pinball machine.
          
          12   ANGLE ON PINBALL
          
               The PLAYER wiggles and contorts, using body English to influence the
               balls.
          
                                               -4-
          
          
          
                                           HECKLER
                                Hey Morton, you think your ass is
                                connected to the machine? You
                                wiggle, it's gonna make the ball go
                                where you want?
          
          12A   Cameron's eyes scan the room, passing the TV above the counter. On
                it, the commercial shows a beautiful girl (who we'll later know as
                NINA FRANKLIN) bending over a bowl of dog food. Her ass, too,
          12B   wiggles engagingly. The pinball player leaves the machine.
                Cameron, stalling for time, works the plunger while a cop stalks
                closer; like the cat to the mouse hole.
          
                                           POLICEMAN
                                Hey, you're lucky. Somebody left a
                                free ball.
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Uh huh.
          
                Cameron shoots. The ball bounces crazily inside the machine, lights
                and buzzers flashing. Another policeman approaches.
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN
                                You got 20,000! You're gonna win...
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Win what?
          
                                           SECOND POLICEMAN
                                A free game!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                Terrific...
          
                He rests his hands on the machine, glancing about.    Escape seems
                hopeless.
          
                                           CAMERON (CONT'D)
                                ...that's just what I needed...one
                                more chance to lose.
          
                In a lightning-swift motion, the cop clamps his hands down over
                Cameron's wrists, snapping the HANDCUFFS on. The trap has sprung.
          13    CLOSE ON COP AND CAMERON
          
                Cameron nods his head in resignation. A big uncontrollable grin
                breaks and spreads over the cop's face.
          
                                              -5-
          
          
               Then suddenly, Cameron bolts, desperately springing full speed for
               the back door. He flings it open. The cops are moving toward him.
               One has almost got his gun out.
          
                                            POLICEMAN
                                Cameron!   Halt! I'll shoot!
          
               Cameron lunges through the doorway, not realizing in his frenzy the
               screen door still blocks his path. He tears through it, but gets
               stuck halfway.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (panicked)
                                No!...God, don't shoot!
          
               Swinging his manacled arms like a club against the tangled mesh, he
               breaks free and runs.
          
          14   EXT.   REAR OF DINER
          
               As Cameron flies down the back steps, a COP stationed at the rear
               door, caught off-guard, tries to stop him but is shoved flat on his
               back. Cameron weaves and scrambles across the yard, over fences,
               between the shed and the barn, rolling beneath a building, out the
               other side. Behind him, distant shouts and a gunshot.
          
          15   INT.   FOREST - MOVING SHOT ON CAMERON - DAY
          
               As Cameron runs, he moves with a skill that suggests forests are not
               alien to him. He crouches low, following tiny avenues in the maze
               of tree trunks, scrambling on all fours over needles and fallen
               cones. Sweat pours down his face. His breath rasps in his throat.
               He breaks into a clearing and FREEZES...suddenly face to face with a
               MAN who crouches, blocking his path. It is one of the telephone
               linemen we saw earlier.
          
          16   WIDER ANGLE
          
               The lineman, kneeling at his tool chest, is surprised by Cameron.
               The other lineman is halfway up the power pole. They both stare at
               Cameron's handcuffs. Cameron edges back, his escape route blocked.
               The man on the ground grabs a WRENCH and moves forward with the same
               gleam in his eye we saw when he scared that bird from the tree.
          
                                           LINEMAN
                                Stand right there like a good old
                                boy and do what I say. You wanna
                                try and mess with me, you've had
                                fair warning. I was a combat Marine
                                in Korea. Okay?
          
                                                 -6-
          
          
               The lineman advances on him as Cameron backs away.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  Korea? No shit, so was my old
                                  man...
                                     (he suddenly stamps his
                                      foot and shrieks)
                                  Aaaaaaaargh!
          
               The lineman jumps in surprise. Then, enraged like a startled bull,
               he lunges forward with the wrench. Cameron uses the man's weight
               against him, his moves those of a trained fighter. A hard knee to
               his stomach doubles up the lineman. The handcuffed arms slam down
               like a club between his shoulder blades driving him to the ground.
               A kick thrown sideways to his head and the man is out. The other
               lineman who had started to descend the pole freezes and takes one
               step back up. Cameron grabs the lineman's toolbox in his handcuffed
               grasp and dashes off into the forest.
          
          17   MOVING SHOT - ON CAMERON
          
               He slides down a slope on a carpet of fallen leaves, tumbling to the
               bottom and falls face forward into a running stream where he holds
               his head and drinks. CAMERA MOVES ACROSS the terrain. There are no
               pursuers, the forest is silent.
          
          18   CLOSE UP - HANDCUFFS
          
               The jaws of a wire-cutter clamp down severing the chain connecting
               the cuffs around Cameron's wrists. He lifts his knee from the
               cutter handle. His arms are now free. He wedges a chisel against
               one bracelet and swings a sledgehammer against it. We hear his
               sharp outcry.
          
          19   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               Doubled up, holding his wrist in pain. The bracelet is still
               intact. He buttons his shirt cuffs over the metal bands and climbs
               the slope to the bright sunlight on the road above.
          20   EXT.   OLD ABANDONED ROAD - DAY
          
               Cameron is trudging along the old road winding down through the
               mountainous pass. He crosses a bridge. Through the arches of its
               low stone railing, he sees a BLACK RIVER twenty feet below rushing
               toward the sea. Then, glancing back, he is suddenly alert.
          
                                                 -7-
          
          21   CAMERON'S POV
          
               In the far distance, almost lost in the shimmering heat waves from
               the road, is a tiny speck moving toward him.
          
          22   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He clambers down the embankment behind the railing, peering out from
               this hidden vantage.
          
          23   ANGLE ON ROAD
          
               The speck grows larger. The SOUND of the engine is faintly audible
               now. Sunlight flashes from metal and glass. Cameron's apprehension
               suddenly changes to wonderment, for the vehicle is not the police as
               he had feared, but something else. Moving in the shimmering heat
               wave is a splendid, high, humpbacked World War I vintage DUESENBERG
               SEDAN with gleaming brass headlights, roaring towards him.
          24   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               He scrambles up the embankment to thumb a ride. The Duesenberg
               roars past him, filling his eyes and mouth with dust. Suddenly
               there is a screech of brakes.
          
          25   ANGLE ON CAR
          
               The Duesenberg goes into a skid and then bounces to a stop.
               Running, Cameron reaches the car, pulls the front door open and
               climbs in beside the DRIVER.
          26   INT.   CAR
          
                                               CAMERON
                                  Thanks.    I thought you didn't see
                                  me.
          
               The driver, BURT, is a husky, red-haired man about Cameron's age and
               deeply agitated. Pounding his fist against the steering wheel, he
               talks half to Cameron, half to himself.
          
                                               BURT
                                  Damn it.    Screwed it up.   Lost my
                                  nerve.
          
               Fishing a Vick's inhaler from his pocket and shoving it in his
               nostril.
          
                                                -8-
          
          
                                           BURT (CONT'D)
                                Goddamn sinuses. Can't even see
                                straight.
          
               Cameron looks at him, puzzled.
          
                                           CAMERON
                                You want me to drive?
          
               Burt whirls on him, enraged.
          
                                           BURT
                                What the hell is that supposed to
                                mean?!
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (confused)
                                No offense...thought you might...
          
                                           BURT
                                Every one of you jerks is a goddamn
                                hotshot expert! Thanks for the vote
                                of confidence. If you think you can
                                do any better, just come and try it!
          
               He puts his boot in Cameron's stomach and shoves hard.
          
          27   EXT.   CAR
          
               Cameron comes flying out and lands on his back in the road as the
               Duesenberg squeals forward, its open door slamming shut from the
               momentum.
          
               Stunned, the wind knocked out of him, Cameron rises to his elbows.
               Before the old relic has gone thirty yards, again the brakes
               screech, swinging the car into a sliding salute turn, one hundred-
               eighty degrees and it is suddenly screaming back toward Cameron.
          28
               INT.   CAR - ANGLE ON BURT
          
               Driving with one hand on the door handle, his head halfway out the
               window watching the bridge railing and the water beyond.
          
                                             -9-
          
          29   ANGLE ON ROAD - CAR AND CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sprawled on the road, is momentarily paralyzed at the sight
               of the Duesenberg's great brass grill bearing down. His hand closes
               over a rock and with the same illogical gesture that a soldier
               flings a Coke bottle at a tank, Cameron hurls the rock in the
               direction of the car and frantically rolls sideways. The big
               spinning tires brush him as they pass. We catch a momentary glimpse
               of the rock smashing against the gleam of the passing windshield.
          
               As he stops rolling, once more face down in the dust, eyes closed,
               expecting death, he becomes aware there is only silence. He opens
               his eyes, climbs to his feet. The road is empty. The Duesenberg is
               gone. Astonished, confused -- he walks to the side of the bridge
               where the railing ends and the car might have plunged off. There is
               nothing below but the rushing black water. Here and there bubbles
               swirl to the surface. They could be from a sinking car or could be
               caused by the current.
          
          30   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
               His thoughts racing. Was it the sun, has he imagined the whole
               thing? Suddenly a HELICOPTER appears, hovering, almost at eye
               level. Sunlight flashes through the spinning blades like a strobe.
          
          31   WIDER ANGLE
          
               It is the same helicopter we saw in the opening sequence. It has
               swiftly descended beside the bridge just beyond the railing,
               catching Cameron with no chance to run or hide. FOUR MEN Can be
               seen inside the plastic cockpit barely a few feet away. The man
               beside the PILOT is ELI CROSS. He grabs the radio microphone and
               begins speaking into it. Cameron whirls, scrambles down a bank to a
               field. The helicopter drops to within a few feet of the water,
               hovers. Protected from sight, Cameron runs between the tall stalks,
               away from the road.
          
          32   CAMERON - MOVING SHOT
          
               Glancing back through the stalks as he runs, Cameron sees a STAKE
               TRUCK barreling toward the sight of the accident. In the back,
               THREE MEN are frantically putting on black wet-suits. They look,
               from this distance, like little black toys tumbling against each
               other. Cameron runs on.

          33    EXT.   BLUFF - OVERLOOKING SEASHORE TOWN
          
                A few hotels, like a cluster of old Victorian gingerbread, surround
                a sandy cove beyond which is the sea. There is a fishing pier,
                boardwalk, hot dog stands, pizza parlors, all swarming with
                sunbathing TOURISTS. The town's bucolic, turn-of-the-century charm
                might even survive these, if not for a monstrous yellow CONSTRUCTION
                CRANE, which juts ten stories into the sky from the center of the
                sandy cove. Cameron appears on the bluff.
          
          34    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Surveying the town -- expressionless, a jungle beast going to
                survive no matter what -- at least for a few more hours. He reaches
                down and rips off his trouser legs at the thigh, turning them into
                cutoffs a vacationing bather might wear. He pulls off his worn
                boots and flings them into the brush, his eyes never leaving the
                town below. There are crowds to get lost in down there. He
                unbuttons his sleeve and looks at the handcuff still encircling his
                wrist. Stopping beside a large rock, he smashes the bracelet
                against it. It won't open. Grimacing in pain, he re-buttons the
                sleeve, opens his shirt and begins descending the palisades toward
                the town.
          35    EXT.   BOARDWALK
          
                The SCREEN is yellow and on it are the words: 'HAVE A NICE DAY.'
                THE ANGLE WIDENS and we realize the words are on the back of a
                YELLOW HAT that jiggles as its wearer walks. It is Cameron. Beyond
                him we see the tide of tourists in oils and ointments flirting with
                the sun. Teenage girls at portable toilets adjusting their bikinis.
                The boardwalk cops in white shirts, looking like ice cream vendors,
                whom Cameron deftly avoids. Then, he looks up at the sky,
                perplexed: the helicopter from the bridge is overhead, circling.
                Cameron watches it warily as he walks.
          
          35A   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK
          
                A BIG CROWD has formed at the railing of the pier. Many of the
                people with CAMERAS CLICKING at the sand below. Cameron notices the
                helicopter is now sharing the sky with a brightly painted open
                cockpit BIPLANE. It is a WORLD WAR I FIGHTER with BRITISH INSIGNIA.
          
          35B   ANGLE ON BOARDWALK AND SKY
          
                Cameron works his way through the crowd. All eyes now look upward
                at the plane. A LOUD VOICE is HEARD coming through an electric
                BULLHORN.
          
                                             - 11 -
          
          
                                           VOICE
                                All right, people. Quiet! We're
                                losing the sun! This is a take!
                                You're welcome to watch, but please,
                                no flashbulbs. They'll spoil the
                                shot.
          
               Cameron's world has become more ordered again. It's a film company
               shooting on location -- this somehow must explain the Duesenberg.
               His eyes go to the scene below.
          36   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               A CAMERA RIG suspended from the end of the yellow construction crane
               is PHOTOGRAPHING the surf where EXTRAS in German WWI uniforms
               unload ashore. The bright little plane has started a lazy dive
               toward the soldiers, its engine whining. From here it looks as
               fearsome as Snoopy and the Red Baron.
          
          37   ANGLE ON THE BEACH
          
               As the British plane pulls out of the dive, there is a tremendous
               explosion. In the flash of smoke and flame, barge, rowboats,
               ammunition and people are blown sky-high. The smoke from the
               exploding ammunition momentarily obscures the scene.
          38   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               The onlookers are very impressed and pleased and then abruptly their
               pleasure turns to horror and disbelief.
          39   ANGLE ON COVE
          
               As the smoke lifts, the Tom and Jerry violence has become a
               horrifying reality. Bodies are scattered about. One man has been
               severed in half, drenched in blood. Chunks of meat, arms and legs
               litter the beach.
          40   ANGLE ON CROWD
          
               Paralyzed by the sense of catastrophe.
          
                                           MAN
                                   (shouting)
                                Something went wrong.
          
               Then, people begin to moan and scream.
          
                                                 - 12 -
          
          41    CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring tensely at the carnage.      By reflex, a shout escapes his
                lips.
          
                                               CAMERON
                                   Medic!   Get the medics!
          41A   A WOMAN sags into a faint.      A small child in the crowd is crying and
                clutching Cameron's leg.
          
          42    ANGLE ON COVE
          
                As the scene continues we hear a voice on the Bullhorn.
          
                                               VOICE (O.S.)
                                   Cut!   I said CUT! That's a print.
          
                Suddenly the reality of the horror turns into an obscene, absurd
                farce as what appear to be the missing parts of bodies begin
                wriggling out of the sand where the extras were partially buried to
                create the macabre effect and now the extras become whole human
                beings before our eyes once again.
          
          43    ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                The crowd reacts in various ways. Sighs of relief, laughter, anger.
                The exhumed extras wipe sand from their eyes and shake it down their
                trouser legs.
          
                                              A.D.
                                      (yelling)
                                   Beautiful, Harvey. You gave
                                   everybody a heart attack.
          
                HARVEY, the Second Unit Director, yells back.
          
                                              HARVEY
                                   Eli will hate it. He said he wanted
                                   the shot in one? Now watch, he'll
                                   do six hours of pick-ups.
          
                The crowd disperses.      A TOURIST turns to Cameron.
          
                                              TOURIST
                                   Great...but why do they always use
                                   so much blood? It ruins the
                                   realism, don't you think?
          
                                              - 13 -
          
          
                                          CAMERON
                                  (still shaken, quietly
                                   mutters)
                               ...asshole...
          
               The tourist stiffens as Cameron turns away, his attention now drawn
               by the beating sound of the helicopter. He glances up.
          44   CAMERON'S POV
          
               The helicopter is descending toward the beach while the FILM CREW
               rapidly moves equipment from the last scene into piles to clear a
               landing site.
          
          45   ANGLE ON FISHING PIER
          
               Wary of the men in the chopper, Cameron is moving down the pier away
               from the landing site. Suddenly he stops short, caught by something
               he sees O.S. Excitedly he points and begins to shout.
          
                                            CAMERON
                               Hey!    Hey you...!
          46   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Below him, walking away on the sand is one of the actors with the
               same red hair, the same old British army jacket as Burt -- the man
               in the Duesenberg. Hearing the shout, the actor stops and
               tentatively turns. It's a mistake. Clearly the features are
               different. It's not Burt.
          47   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CAMERON
          
               Cameron is puzzled. He watches as the red-haired actor looks about
               to see who called and finding no one, starts off, but is stopped by
               a LITTLE OLD LADY holding a parasol and offering her autograph book.
          
                                          LITTLE OLD LADY
                               Mr. Bailey! Aren't you Raymond
                               Bailey, the actor? Would you please
                               sign your autograph? Write 'to
                               Emily...for eternal peace.'
          
               Raymond signs the book with the easy charm of a man who's done it a
               million times. He has those special rugged good looks that belong
               to Marlboro men and movie stars.

                                          LITTLE OLD LADY (CONT'D)
                               I'm certainly glad you're all right.
                               I lost my husband and my son in the
                               wars...
          
               The sound of the chopper blades has become deafening as it hovers
               for a landing. The Old Lady snatches her autograph book and heads
               for the landing site.
          
          48   ANGLE ON HELICOPTER
          
               As it touches the ground and its doors fly open. Out step the
               CREWMEN and ELI CROSS. The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR rushes up and shouts
               over the hissing blades of the idling chopper.
          
                                          A.D.
                               What happened on the bridge?!

                               the goddamn camera.

                                          ELI
                                  (anguished)
                               No Burt! All gone...caught in the
                               current probably and...they're
                               diving downstream and searching the
                               riverbanks, but...don't say anything
                               to the crew yet...

                               Jesus Christ.
          
                                          ELI
                               Yeah, Jesus Christ.
          
                                          A.D.
                               What do you want to do?
          
                                              - 15 -
          
          
                                           ELI
                                I don't know...call my mother and
                                have her tell me it wasn't my
                                fault...
                                   (desperately)
                                ...What the hell could have
                                happened?
          
               Their words are lost in the sound of the rotor as the chopper slowly
               rises. The sudden WIND from its blades blows some screening off a
               pile of equipment. It falls on the Little Old Lady who has been
               approaching Eli and topples her into the surf. She is trapped in a
               tangle of ancient skirts and petticoats. Before she can regain her
               balance, a wave tumbles her further into the sea.
          
          49   ANGLE INCLUDING CAMERON
          
               Cameron, sitting on the edge of the pier over the water, has watched
               this mini-disaster. The undertow from the wave has swept the Old
               Lady directly beneath him. Reaching down toward her, he yells:
          
                                            CAMERON
                                Hey!   Hey, give me your hand!
          
               He can't quite reach her. As a last resort, he drops off the edge
               into the water by her side.
          50   ANGLE ON WATER
          
               He grabs for the struggling Old Lady.
          
                                           CAMERON

                                okay.
          
               Like groping through seaweed, he reaches past her tangled skirts,
               grasps her waist and lifts her to keep her head above water. She is
               choking, gasping for air. She turns her face toward him.
          
          51   CAMERON'S POV
          
               Her features are distorted; they seem to be melting away. She frees
               her hand and violently tears at her face, pulling away the RUBBER
               MASK on which is the melting putty and make up. With it goes her
               wig and what is left is a startlingly beautiful young girl.

          The sun glistens on the wet, wild young perfection of her face,
          ingenuously sparkling laughter and for an instant it's breathtaking
          - a universal boyhood fantasy to suddenly be thrown this close to
          that kind of "movie star" beauty. It's something Cameron feels in
          the pit of his stomach.

          As they are only in a few feet of water, there is no longer any
          reason to hold her. He starts to put her down.

          Grinning, he carries her toward shore.

               ANGLE ON BEACH
          
               Eli, surrounded by the crew and dozens of tourists, is standing at
               the water's edge as Cameron wades in and sets Nina down.
          
                                          ELI
                                Nina! You damned near scared me to
                                death!
          
               At the sight of Eli, she becomes like a little girl who, having
               skinned her knee and run to daddy, now can allow herself to cry.
          
                                           NINA
                                Oh hell, it's all ruined now and I
                                wanted you to see the makeup, Eli.
                                Where were you?...I even got
                                Raymond's autograph and he didn't
                                know...You'd have been proud...
          
               Nina is surrounded by people who are rubbing her with towels, taking
               pictures, all shouting at once. The CROWD closes in, excluding
               Cameron to the outskirts.

                                want to see her in makeup and
                                costume again before dinner.
          
               THREE CREWMEN hustle her off, as she searches the crowd for
               Cameron...then spots him.
          
                                           NINA
                                Hey! Thank you! That was really
                                gallant...rescuing an old lady!
          
               Cameron waves and starts to wander off as they whisk Nina away.

               He moves toward Cameron.
          
                                           ELI
                                Wait a second!   I want to thank you,
                                too!
          
               As Eli trots up, Cameron tenses, finally facing this man who saw him
               from the helicopter.

                          Don't run away.   What is that, a

                          about telling me what happened?
          
          Eli begins to stroll along the sand toward the pilings which support
          the pier. Cameron hesitates, but Eli's manner compels him to
          follow.
          
                                     CAMERON

                          crazy. He tried to run me down.
          
                                     ELI
                          Oh?...Why would he do that?

               A POLICE CAR has driven onto the beach. From it, THREE OFFICERS
               have emerged. They are armed and efficient looking. The PRODUCTION
               MANAGER moves to greet them. Eli takes Cameron's wrist and gently
               pulls him back into the shadow of the pilings, (privately reacting
               to the handcuff he feels beneath the shirt). JAKE, the Chief, is
               irate enough to be clearly heard from this distance.
          
                                          JAKE

          Cameron studies Eli, not knowing what to make of him.

                          shape, fast on your feet. You could

                          Cross, I've gone out of my way, but
                          this time...
          
          A TRAM beeps, clangs and passes between them, interrupting Jake and
          leaving him sputtering. As it departs, Eli seizes the moment.
          
                                     ELI
                          Jake, it's been a rotten morning.
                          You're hot and tired. Let's go in,
                          have us a drink and find out what's
                          eating you.
          
                                     JAKE
                             (turning beet red)
                          Don't treat me like these other
                          morons! You know goddamn well
                          what's eating me is that Duesenberg
                          on the bottom of the river with the
                          dead man in it!
          
          There is silence. Eli stands thoughtfully kicking the sand with his
          toe. Then Jake starts shouting again.
          
                                     JAKE (CONT'D)
                          I mean, that is a goddamn public
                          bridge and a public river! You go
                          there without permits, without any
                          precautions and get a man killed!
          
                                    ELI
                             (gently)
                          Jake...
          
                                     JAKE
                          No more bullshit explanations. Just
                          go...before I figure out how to hang
                          you with a manslaughter charge!

                             (after a pause; quietly)
                          No explanations...don't have any.
                          But, maybe he does...
                             (staring at Cameron)
                          Go ahead, ask him, Jake.
          
          Eli's words are exploding in Cameron's mind -- that illusory event
          on the bridge has crystallized into hard reality.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (wide-eyed)
                          ...Now wait!...You're not blaming me
                          for...
          
                                     ELI
                             (wheeling on Cameron)
                          Why not, Burt?! Because you're a
                          fake?! Because you're just a
                          goddamn daredevil with a head full
                          of marbles?!
          
          Cameron vaguely understands that Eli is trying to pass him off as
          Burt and that he, somehow, may be saved by going along with this
          madness. Eli, turning to Jake, continues passionately...
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          He grabs the bread, blows the shot,
                          screws you up...screws me up. He's
                          dumb, Jake, but thank God, he ain't
                          dead yet. So do me a favor, put
                          your handcuffs on this son-of-a-
                          bitch and put him some place where
                          he can't get hurt!
          
          The Chief is dazed. If this is Burt, the stunt man, he is obviously
          alive. Jake goes to Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          How did you get out of the car?
          
                                     ELI
                          He didn't get out. Our divers got
                          him out...and brought him back in
                          the chopper.
          
          The Chief stares at Cameron. His clothes and hair are wet. There
          is a small bruise on his cheek from when he fell out of the
          Duesenberg. He looks the part. Jake turns to Eli with resignation.
          
                                    JAKE

                          Cross, when these three days are up,
                          I'm going to arm my men with
                          shotguns and tell them it's open
                          season on any fruit carrying a
                          camera.
          
          He walks to the waiting police car, surrounded by TOURISTS snapping
          pictures. He glares at them, angry at the world. Eli puts his arm
          on Cameron's shoulder and leads him through the dispersing crowd
          toward the hotel. Eli is now easygoing and friendly.
          
                                     ELI
                          You did that very well.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          I didn't get a chance to say a word.
                          I just listened.
          
                                     ELI
                          There are only a few actors in the
                          world who have mastered that art.
                          Anyway, it was a good audition. You
                          landed the part.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How? What about the crew? They
                          going to look at me and say, 'Hi,
                          Burt?'
          
                                     ELI
                          Unless you prefer, 'Hi, Elizabeth.'
                          Don't worry about my crew, they'll
                          call you anything I want 'em to.
                          Look, I'm not being callous. Burt
                          is a fucking tragedy, but there's
                          nothing in the world I can do about
                          it...I've gotta have this location
                          for three more days...and you need a
                          place to hide.
          
          They have reached the steps of the HOTEL. A BUS has stopped in
          front. TOURISTS are piling out. The POLICE CAR pulls up and parks
          nearby. Jake and his men can be seen surveying the crowd.
          
                                     A.D.
                             (shouting in b.g.)
                          Eli! The crew's waiting.   We need
                          the next setup!

                          The hand! Close-up of the hand!      Be
                          there in a minute!

                          An Eli minute or a real minute?!
          
          Eli turns back to Cameron as they mount the steps.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          By tomorrow the local cops'll know
                          what I look like. I can't hang
                          around.
          
                                     ELI
                             (expansively)
                          "Burt," stop worrying! Haven't you
                          heard of "movie magic?"
                             (pointing to the etched
                              glass doors of the hotel)
                          That door is "the looking glass,"
                          and inside...is Wonderland. You're
                          gonna pose as a stunt man, who's
                          posing as an actor, who's posing as
                          a character in a movie...who's
                          posing as an enemy soldier...In that
                          big a crowd, who's gonna notice you?
                          People like to believe in things and
                          cops are just people.
          
          The have reached the front door.   Eli holds it open for Cameron.
          
                                     ELI
                             (with mock confidentiality)
                          Frankly, your problem's so simple,
                          it's almost beneath me. Have faith,
                          'Alice.' Close your eyes and enjoy.
          
          In exhaustion and resignation, Cameron nods and wearily closes his
          eyes.

                His eyes open. He stares at his face in the mirror, pleased at the
                subtle transformation. His hair has been cut shorter and dyed red,
                somehow changing his whole aspect. He rubs the red mark on his
                wrists where the bracelet has been removed.
          
          56A   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Part of the laundry room is being used for the film's Hairdressing
                Department. Cameron sits in a barber chair wearing a plastic apron,
                surrounded by dryers, wigs, etc. In b.g., washing machines churn
                constantly. DENISE, the Hairdresser, an attractive earthy woman of
                thirty-two, stands over him. He is still wary and trying not to
                show it.

                                    (looking in mirror)
                                 ...Could be worse...could be
                                 green...I think I like it.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 Of course you like it...ask
                                 anybody... Denise gives great hair.
                                 Got any grass?

                                 Nope.
          
                She touches his hair to test the dryness, holding her hand there for
                a moment longer than seems necessary. He grins at her, rises and
                crosses to the wall mirror to get a better look.
          
                                            DENISE
                                 What else don't you have that I
                                 need?
          
                She moves to a basement window and gazes out.

                Through the window, the crew is setting up a shot while Eli
                rehearses with Nina and his red-haired male star, RAYMOND BAILEY,
                (who Cameron earlier saw on the beach). Bailey is dressed as a
                World War I British aviator and Nina as a young girl of that era.

                          You're too good looking. His idea
                          of a perfect stunt double is two-
                          hundreds pounds of hamburger in a
                          red wig...
          
          He studies the view, his attention focused on Nina.

                          At selling douche powder, she's
                          fabulous; dog food?...I'm not sure
                          she's sincere.

                          I'm not sore. Isn't that what you
                          wanted to know?
                             (with sarcasm)
                          ...Or did you mean, what's the real
                          Nina Franklin like--without the
                          greasepaint and tinsel...
          
          Moving to a pile of laundry heaped on the floor, she pokes around
          with the toe of her shoe.
          
                                     DENISE (CONT'D)
                          ...You mean, what's she like --
                          underneath?
          
          Snaring a crumpled garment, she kicks it toward Cameron, who catches
          it instinctively, then holds it up for inspection -- a pair of
          (Nina's) lace panties. He grins, mildly embarrassed by the charade.

                                   What do those say about the girl who
                                   wears them? Shy? Delicate?
                                   Sensitive?
          
               She reaches for the panties, but instead takes his hand and yanks
               sharply, pulling him off balance, falling back on the laundry pile
               with Cameron on top of her, their faces inches apart; surprise on
               his, amusement on hers.

                                   Still wet...very wet.
          
               Cameron is trying to remember: what was it Eli said? "Close your
               eyes, relax and enjoy." Across the room the washing machines churn,
               whirl and heave.
          
          59   EXT.   BEACH AREA
          
               Eli and his crew are shooting a scene: a "pick-up" shot for the
               explosion sequence we saw earlier. Eli and GABE, the cameraman, are
               lying beside the camera. Before them, the "severed" arm protrudes
               from the sand in which its owner is buried, out of sight.
          
                                              ELI
                                   You sure he can breathe?
                                      (a mumbling assent from
                                       beneath the sand)
                                   Where's Raymond?
                                      (Raymond kneels beside
                                       him)
                                   Remember, you just crashed...you
                                   were wandering the beach behind the
                                   German lines looking for a place to
                                   hide when you saw the explosion.
                                   You're stunned by the carnage. That
                                   bomb was dropped by a guy in your
                                   squadron. Okay? Roll the film.
          60   POV THRU CAMERA
          
               Through the CAMERA, WE SEE the 'arm' protruding from the sand. We
               HEAR o.s. VOICES yelling: "Turning"... "speed"... "action." We see
               the fingers begin to move spasmodically. Eli's voice yells: "Okay,
               Raymond!"
          
               Suddenly the fingers on the hand start to swell, bigger and
               bigger...like a rubber glove filling with air...then BANG! BANG!
               BANG! The (balloon-covered) fingers EXPLODE.

          61   ANGLE ON BEACH
          
               Everyone has broken up with laughter at the prank, including Eli.
               Gabe is patting Eli's face, Raymond squeezing his jaw affectionately
               as one would a pet dog's.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (cackling)
                                Gotcha that time! Didn't we?
          
                                           ELI
                                   (through his laughter)
                                Yeah, you got me another half-hour
                                behind.
          
               Eli climbs to his feet as the laughter subsides. Cameron, now
               wearing a uniform exactly like Raymond's, watches from the
               sidelines.

                                cheering up today.

                                ...So you heard the news about

                                Afraid not...there's no picture ever
                                made that's worth it.
          
                                           RAYMOND
                                   (shaking his head)
                                I'll never understand why these guys
                                do it -- take the chances.

                                Don't know. Trying to beat the
                                system, I guess...we all know that
                                some day we're gonna die of nothing
                                more important than wrinkles...and
                                that makes us so scared and crazy,
                                we'll do anything. Go off
                                bridges...fight windmills...wars...
                                anything.
          
               There is great sadness among them.     Eli breaks the mood lightly.

                                Hey, Burt, come over here.
          
               Cameron crosses to them. He and Raymond stand appraising each
               other, red-haired men in identical uniforms. As Raymond offers his
               hand:

                                Not new...It's important not to let
                                that get around as yet. So, for the
                                time being, let's make like he's the
                                same guy.
                                   (adding a touch of color)
                                But no longer known as "Bad-assed
                                Burt." Ever since his 'fortunate

          62   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ANGLE ON CHUCK - LATER THAT DAY
          
               CHUCK BARTON is a tall, rugged-looking man in his mid-thirties, the
               Stunt Gaffer on Eli's film. A MESSENGER trots up and presents a
               receipt book. Chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently.
          
                                           MESSENGER
                                Your film from that camera in the
                                Duesenberg's on the way to the lab.
                                Put it on the plane with my own
                                little hands.

                          Don't know. Stamped it "rush."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          If I stamp "rush" on my mare's ass,
                          she'll still take eleven months to
                          foal. Call the lab and find out
                          when!
                             (quietly)
                          I lost a man today. I wanna see
                          that footage and find out why.
          
          As the Messenger leaves, Chuck strolls over to where Cameron stands
          waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. Cameron is no longer
          wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt.
          
                                     CHUCK

                          I got out of Vietnam in one piece.
                          Let me tell you that wasn't a bad
                          stunt.

               Gauging the fifteen-foot gap between the CHURCH STEEPLE and the roof
               of the nearby MUNICIPAL BUILDING. He unconsciously grimaces at the
               four-story drop between them.

                                  (being glib)
                               Once, to save my ass, I jumped out
                               of a banana tree into an oxcart full
                               of buffalo shit. Does that count?
          
                                            CHUCK
                               We'll see.    Put these on.
          
               He throws Cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins
               marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in
               the churchyard.

                               there.
          
               Cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads

               approval.

                               Very good. Except you're dead!!
                               Your brains are scattered all over
                               the goddamn pavement. You landed on
                               the edge and fell backwards four
                               stories. Where do we send the body?

          He takes a running start and leaps hard.    While he's still in mid-
          air, Chuck yells.
          
                                     CHUCK
                          You're still dead! You fell over
                          the other side of the building.
          
          Cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at Chuck a bit
          shaken.

          Chuck launches himself head-first. His hands touch the ground just
          beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder
          roll, he somersaults to his feet.

          He takes a running start and does the same.   Not quite as well, but
          well enough. As he rolls to his feet:

               Cameron sailing into the SHOT. Chuck ducks slightly, catching
               Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. Cameron
               lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building.
               Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. The church steeple can
               be seen in b.g. (and we now realize time has passed and we are no
               longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the
               building).

                Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his
                shoulder. Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck
                strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. Cameron
                scrambles to follow.

               They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a NARROW CENTRAL
               COURTYARD. They gaze down at a WINDOW AWNING two stories below that
               juts from the side of the building-wing across the court.

                                "cut" and old Raymond takes your
                                place for the close-ups and the
                                glory. That's where the German

               In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal
               building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in
               a World War I military asylum. In it, Eli's crew is filming a
               sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters, heads shaven, wild-
               eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of
               Cameron's exultant yell).

               Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and
               retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated
               derelicts suddenly swarm over him. One, like a mad dog, goes fro
               his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club.
               Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams.

               by a distant shout overhead.

                                    (on the roof overhead)
                                ...Six-fucking-hundred, gorgeous,
                                beautiful dollars! I can't believe
                                it!
          
               The slavering madmen look up, then out at the camera, madmen no
               longer, simply bewildered actors.
          
                                          ELI'S VOICE
                                All right. Hold it! Hold it!

          ANGLE ON CREW
          
          Eli stands amidst the camera crew photographing the scene.   He is
          waving for order.
          
                                     ELI
                          ...Save it, everybody.
          
                                     A.D.
                             (storming in)
                          Jesus Christ, what the hell was
                          that? Somebody get their ass up on
                          that roof...
          
                                     ELI
                             (cutting him off)
                          ...Never mind. I didn't like it
                          anyway.
          
          As Eli steps down from the DOLLY, a solemn, quiet man approaches him
          from among the onlookers. It is SAM BAUM (the writer).
          
                                     SAM
                          What's wrong?
          
                                     ELI
                          The scene's wrong.
                             (yells to the A.D.)
                          Call a break.
          
          The A.D. Calls "Five minutes" and the crew moves toward the coffee
          urn. Eli wanders toward the door, Sam pursuing.
          
                                     SAM
                             (fighting for his scene)
                          Eli, it played like a dream.   My
                          God, it was Marat-Sade.
          
                                     ELI
                             (glumly)
                          It played like shit!
          
                                             - 38 -
          
          
                                           SAM
                                   (desperate)
                                Well, who was that on the phone in
                                the middle of the night when you
                                first read it, raving about the
                                magical madhouse scene, the upstairs
                                maid?
          
               Eli rips the page with the "madhouse scene" from his screenplay as
               they stride out of the building.
          
          69   EXT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               There, beside the rear entrance on a pile of construction sand, sits
               Eli, cross-legged, staring morosely at some kids who play nearby.
               He is absently folding a torn script page into a paper airplane.
               Behind him, at a respectful distance, stand the Production Manager,
               A.D., half a dozen assorted crew chiefs and Sam Baum, all looking
               concerned. Sam looks at the others, shrugs and approaches Eli,
               squatting beside him on the sand pile.
          
                                           SAM
                                What do you wanna do, Eli?...
                                They're all waiting.
          
               While Sam talks, Eli takes a fistful of sand and pours it in Sam's
               shoe. Suddenly noticing, Sam yanks his foot away.
          
                                           SAM (CONT'D)
                                   (irritated)
                                Being childish isn't going to help
                                your movie...You know, there's
                                nothing wrong with the story.
                                   (removing his shoe and
                                    shaking the sand out)
                                The real problem is since I wrote
                                this thing two years ago, you've had
                                Watergate, the energy crisis,
                                Women's Lib, the economy is down the
                                tubes...You want to talk about
                                burning issues?...There's arsenic in
                                the glue on the back of food stamps!
                                That's why you don't like the
                                "madhouse scene." Your goddamn war
                                story has lost its relevance.
          
                                           ELI
                                Don't be negative, Sam. We can
                                start a new one in time for the
                                preview.
          
                                             - 39 -
          
          
               Sam has finished replacing his shoe and Eli pours a fistful of sand
               into Sam's other shoe.
          
                                           SAM
                                Cut it out, will ya?
          
          70   INT.   HOTEL DINING ROOM - THAT NIGHT
          
               Eli is at the head of a long table, CAMERA PULLING BACK TO REVEAL a
               dozen members of the company dining with him. Nina sits beside Eli
               listening with rapt attention to Sam's monologue, her dessert fork
               sensuously lingers at her lip.
          
                                           SAM
                                Two years ago you were all charged
                                up to make a great big anti-war
                                statement and they wouldn't let you.
                                Now they let you, but you haven't
                                got a war. What you've got is egg
                                on your face because Vietnam's long
                                gone and it's too late!
          
                                           ELI
                                Our picture's not about fighting
                                wars...
          
                                          SAM
                                Oh?
          
                                           ELI
                                ...It's about fighting windmills.
          
               The truth in Eli's statement registers on Sam. Cameron sits farther
               down the table, watching Nina watch Eli...and wishing she were
               watching him.
          
                                           ELI
                                War isn't the disease...It's only
                                one of the symptoms.
          
                                           SAM
                                   (hooked)
                                What's the disease?

                                     ELI
                          That's the big question, Sam. Name
                          the disease and you've licked the
                          screenplay.
                             (indicating Cameron)
                          Ask him. 'Cause he knows what the
                          film is about. Right Lucky? Tell
                          'em...How'd you like Vietnam?
          
                                     CAMERON
                          How'd you like bubonic plague?
          
                                     ELI
                          You drafted?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          No.
          
                                     ELI
                          See, Sam? Here's another one who
                          hates war...but he enlisted.
                              (to Cameron)
                          You fought in Vietnam for two years?
                          ...I mean actually were out there
                          killing people...
          
                                     CAMERON
                          ...Hey, I didn't kill that many
                          people...
          
                                     ELI
                          Don't be modest, Lucky. Everybody
                          digs a little violence...What was
                          that you said on the beach?
          
          Cameron is starting to bristle at Eli's needling, particularly with
          Nina watching.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          About what?
          
                                     ELI
                          About getting home for Thanksgiving?
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (tentatively)
                          ...that you better figure the guy
                          coming at you is trying to kill
                          you...?
          
                                    ELI
          
                                         - 41 -
          
          
                            Yeah. See, Sam?...That's what the
                            disease is about...being scared
                            shitless. Inventing enemies.
                            Whistling in the dark. I wish you'd
                            talk to the kid, Sam, I mean it.
                            You know, really, you guys should
                            room together.
          
                                       SAM
                               (getting the last word)
                            Hey, Lucky, give me your cot by the
                            window and I'll let you read a great
                            madhouse sequence.
          
          They all laugh.
          
                                       SAM
                               (surrendering)
                            All right, Eli. I'll write you
                            another scene. What difference does
                            it make? The studio will cut it all
                            out anyway and what you got left is
                            a lot of swell battle scenes, which,
                            when I was back there they said were
                            "just terrific."
          
                                       ELI
                               (simply)
                            No, they won't.
          
                                       SAM
                            Yeah, what makes you different?
          
                                       ELI
                               (quietly)
                            Because they know if they cut my
                            picture, I'll kill 'em.
          
          The deadly in Eli's voice was more than intended and there is
          suddenly an awkward silence at the table. Cameron eyes Eli with a
          wry smile.
          
                                       CAMERON
                            You mean, bang? Kill 'em, just like
                            that?

                                        ELI
                                (matter of fact)
                             No. I'll kill 'em and eat 'em...I
                             hate to waste anything.

                             Sam, my picture is the only kid I've
                             got! If the studio said your
                             daughter, Jennifer, would look
                             better with her fingers chopped off,
                             what would you do?
          
                                        SAM
                             Being an insecure writer, I'd call
                             my agent...and get another opinion.
          
          Everyone laughs.
          
          Jake, the Chief of Police, is seen in the background approaching the
          table. Cameron spots him and starts to rise.

                             Don't go away, Burt.   I want you.

                             Jake! Long time, no see. You taken
                             care of my problem with the beach?
          
                                        JAKE
                             I'm not talking to you.
                                (to Production Manager)
                             I understand you got that film out
                             of the Duesenberg...

                               I'm talking to this gentleman.

                               We want to see it.
          
               Cameron, realizing the film might disclose his presence on the
               bridge, reacts with alarm, which increases as Eli says...
          
                                          ELI
                               Tell the Chief it's our pleasure.
                               Soon as it gets back...but ask him
                               why.
          
                                           JAKE
                                  (choked up with its
                                    importance)
                               You can tell your Mr. Cross this
                               inquiry comes from a source so high
                               it is not his to question...
                                  (now at a loss for proper
                                    words)

                               Someone they're looking for may have
                               been on that road when the car went
                               off.
                                  (to Cameron)
                               Burt, you see anybody?
          
               Then, suddenly noticing something different about Cameron's
               appearance...
          
                                          JAKE (CONT'D)
                               Hey, did you have red hair
                               before?...

                               like Raymond...I didn't see a soul.

                               Tell the Chief that Burt was so busy
                               being brilliant, he wouldn't have
                               noticed Jesus Christ walking on the
                               water.
          
               Jake pulls a PHOTOGRAPH from a manila envelope and hands it to
               Cameron.

               A wire photo, front and side views of Cameron, taken at his military
               induction. War ages a man...he looks younger and quite different in
               his GI Haircut.
          
                                          ELI (V.O.)
                               Hey, Burt! You got it upside down.

          72   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
               Cameron hands the photo back to the Chief, who passes it around the
               table. Denise receives the photograph, studies it and glances up at
               Cameron, expressionless. He returns her gaze.
          
                                          JAKE (V.O.)
                               A couple of telephone linemen say
                               they saw him headed this way.
          
               Eli takes the photograph.

                                   ignoring Eli's question)
                               The minute that film gets here you
                               give me a call.

                               I don't know about those fifty guys,
                               but I know one weary guy who's gonna
                               crawl upstairs and hit the sack.
          
               Eli looks at Cameron with grudging admiration.

                                I know a weary gay who's going with
                                him!
          
               They mince off (the fag act all the more amusing because of
               Raymond's strictly masculine looks). Eli shouts after them.
          
                                           ELI
                                So long as you're back in ninety
                                minutes. It's a work night for some
                                of us.
                                   (loftily)

               Raymond "gathers" Nina along the way, wrapping his arm about her
               shoulders -- Cameron watching silently. Then, charging from across
               the dining room like a tanker steaming in their wake, comes a
               gushing, overwrought, blue-rinsed MATRON.
          
                                           MATRON
                                Miss Franklin! Miss Franklin! Your
                                'Feminique Spray' commercial is on
                                TV. My God, it's simply heavenly!
          73   INT.   CAMERON'S HOTEL ROOM - CLOSE ON DRESSER - NIGHT
          
               Drawers are slamming open and shut as Cameron hurriedly stuffs his
               few belongings into his pockets.
          
               WIDER ANGLE
          
               It's a mean little bedroom, with Sam's clothes, typewriter, etc., in
               evidence. Seeing Sam's wallet, Cameron pulls a wad of money from
               it, at the same time accidentally knocking Sam's false teeth off the
               dresser. He hesitates, then stuffs back all the bills but a twenty.
               He strides to Sam's closet, pulls out shirt and slacks, stuffs them
               in a cloth beach bag, also belonging to Sam and starts out the door.
               Then he stops, gets on his hands and knees, looking for the false
               teeth, which he finally finds. Now, annoyed at himself for being a
               "nice guy," he throws them carelessly on the dresser and quickly
               exits.

          74    EXT.   HOTEL - LATER THAT NIGHT
          
                As Cameron moves down the steps, the returning company STATION WAGON
                pulls to a stop in the driveway. Nina, Raymond and a few others
                emerge from the car. Cameron turns away so as not to be seen as
                they pass him on the steps heading for the entrance.
          
                                              DENISE
                                   Bet they're looking for that nut who
                                   killed all those campers in Montana...
          
                                             RAYMOND
                                      (drunk)
                                   ...Too many campers, weed 'em out!
                                   ...Imagine, sitting an hour at a
                                   roadblock.

                                   We should have waited, it wouldn't
                                   have been an hour.
          74A   They've entered the hotel. Cameron continues to the bottom of the
                stairs, hesitates, looking back at Nina.
          75    CAMERON'S POV
          
                Silhouetted through the etched glass doors (on the other side of
                "The Looking Glass") he sees the lithe, gay, exquisitely beautiful
                figure of Nina -- light sparkling from the cut glass dances about
                her face -- a hauntingly romantic image.
          76    ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                He watches for a moment with hopeless longing. Finally, turning
                from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk.
                There come some of Eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch
                through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby
                spot to light a night shot. There's the CHURCH TOWER. He stares at
                it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen
                if...
          
                                              NINA'S VOICE
                                   What next? Do you rescue the maiden
                                   from the tower?
          
                She has come up behind him, unnoticed.    He turns, startled, and
                there she stands.

                                (smiles)
                          Hi.
          
          For a moment they search each other's eyes -- for intentions.   Then
          she glances at the tower.
          
                                     NINA
                          Yes. It does look pretty high.
                             (with concern)
                          Are you worried about tomorrow?
          
          Cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she
          would know him instantly. But his answer is simple and sounds
          sincere.
          
                                     CAMERON
                          Not much. I guess if there were any
                          real danger, Eli wouldn't let me do
                          it, would he?
          
                                    NINA
                             (quickly, reassuring)
                          No. I'm sure it's safe.

                              grin)
                          Good. Then you jump.

                          Okay.
          
          She understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in
          Eli. Her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.
          
                                     CAMERON

                          What, right now?
          
          For a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. Then acts on
          his decision. Starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her
          toward the tower. She holds back, struggling playfully.

          77   INT.   BELL TOWER - NIGHT
          
               It is crowded with bells, a small walkway and railing surrounded
               them. The city lights are seen beyond. Below are the sheds where
               crewmen are preparing the next day's shooting. Just beyond is the
               overwhelming silhouette of the huge CRANE. Nina and Cameron reach
               the top of the stairs winded and laughing, as they rush to the
               railing and lean over. Nina gasps, clutching Cameron in genuine
               fright.

                                like robbing a candy store.

               She whirls to go.   He stops her, taking her by the shoulders.

               Her concern for him has turned to anger, like a mother slapping her
               child for running in the street.

               His arm still restrains her. She takes hold of it, then suddenly
               softens with a look of slight surprise.

               After a moment, he answers quietly.

                                gonna jump.
          
               It's true. She is trembling and so is he -- not from fear. He
               slowly draws her toward him, her mouth reaching up to his. And then
               they are devouring each other. Abruptly, they're illuminated by a
               fierce blast of white light. They separate and stare, blinking in
               shock and confusion.

               They are pinned in the crossbeams of two more giant arcs. Quickly
               she yanks him down with her out of sight behind the railing.
          78   EXT.   CHURCHYARD - ELI AND CREW - NIGHT
          
               Eli is lounging in the bucket suspended from the crane.   Beside him
               Gabe adjusts one of the giant brutes.
          
                                           GABE

                                I could kill this brute and fill
                                with juniors. You'd get a halo
                                around the tower.

               Gabe smiles, scurries off. Eli glances at the tower, grins, having
               toyed with them long enough, he yells.

               The church door swings open. Nina and Cameron emerge, covering
               their embarrassment with bravado. Nina is prattling as though to a

          Privately, she gives Cameron's arm an affectionate squeeze, then
          disappears around the corner of the building. He is left holding
          the beach bag, pursued by the Peter Pan in the basket. It has now
          dropped to ground level so Eli is looking up at Cameron.

                He pulls Cameron into the basket beside him so unexpectedly that
                Cameron drops Sam's bag. Eli picks it up and plops it into
                Cameron's lap. Suddenly Cameron finds himself soaring skyward at a
                stomach-churning rate -- while Eli rattles on...probing, disarming,

               The thunderous clang of bells! Cameron ready, coiled tight, heart
               pounding as loud as the bells. A burst of machine gun bullets tears
               through the railing beside him, sending splinters flying against his
               face.

               A burst of tracer bullets streak past Cameron. Sparks fly, as stray
               bullets seem to bounce and ricochet off the bells.
          85   MACHINE GUN
          
               A 50-calibre MACHINE GUN, a SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN in Levi's and sport
               shirt, pumping tracers past the bell tower.
          86   TWO SHOT - BELL TOWER
          
               The Second A.D. slams his hand down on a PLUNGER, setting off a
               series of explosive squibs. Like machine gun bullets, they start
               shattering the railing, moving toward Cameron, forcing him to the
               edge of the tower.
          
               Vaulting over the rail, he clings to the side of the bell tower.
               Explosive bursts disintegrate the railing in his hand. He shoves
               out, launching himself into space. Twisting, hurtling across the
               gap between the buildings, falling, crashing to the slate roof,
               crawling and scrambling for a hand hold. The relentless tracer
               bullets chip the slate beside him. Crouching low, Cameron, like an
               animal, moves across the roof to the safety of a water tower.
               Squibs burst over his head and spouts of water stream from the
               tower.

               Moving around the tower, suddenly there are TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS
               running at him with bayoneted rifles. He wheels and there stands
               ANOTHER GERMAN (Chuck), who leaps toward him, slamming down his
               rifle butt. The blow glances off Cameron. They grapple, kicking,
               clawing, rolling down the steep slope, picking up momentum.
          87   RAIN GUTTER
          
               The roof's edge rushes toward them, below it a fearsome drop.
               Cameron's hands reach out desperately grabbing for the railing as
               Chuck, screaming, hurtles off the edge, writhing as his body tumbles
               in space toward the ground.
          88   CAMERON
          
               Sweat pouring from his face, a gash on his cheek gushes blood, his
               eyes glazed, he pulls himself back on the roof.
          89
               CATCHER
          
               Chuck, lying relaxed on the straw and mattress safety pad which
               caught him on the ground, looks up, cups his hands and shouts at
               Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK

          90   ROOF
          
               Cameron, running for his life along the edge of the roof, the
               soldiers shooting down at him from the roof's peak. He reaches the
               far end, looks down. There is the awning jutting from an adjacent
               wall two stories below. He scrambles off the roof. Clinging to the
               down spout, he starts descending it.
          91   SPECIAL EFFECTS MAN

               The bracket holding the down spout breaks loose. The spout starts
               to fall away from the side of the building. Cameron clings to it,
               riding its downward arc as though it were a falling tree.

          93   AWNING
          
               At the end of the arc, Cameron throws himself free for a safe
               landing and smashes against the awning. Instead of holding, it rips
               apart like paper and, in that unexpected instant, Cameron's eyes
               widen in genuine terror as he plummets through the shredded canvas
               toward a skylight one floor below.
          94   SKYLIGHT
          
               Exploding in a shower of glass and wood as it is struck by Cameron's
               body. He hurtles downward toward a blur of images.
          95   ANGLE ON COT
          
               Collapsing from the impact of Cameron's fall. The MAN and WOMAN who
               were making love on the cot have been flung to the ground and roll
               entwined with him. Cameron is dazed. Like a drowning man, he rages
               to free himself from the tangle of naked limbs and smothering flesh.
               A painted face shrieks in laughter -- as the door to the room he is
               in is thrown open, revealing:
          
          96   BROTHEL SET ­ INT. MUNICIPAL BUILDING
          
               Cameron has fallen into a cubicle in what appears to be a World War
               I German army brothel. In the high-ceilinged room, there is a row
               of cots separated by makeshift screens. COUPLES jump up from the
               cots startled. A line of partly naked GERMAN SOLDIERS waiting their
               turn at the whores have broken into shouts and laughter at Cameron's
               unorthodox entrance. They crowd around the cubicle where Cameron
               fell and now struggles with the couple.

                          Wait your turn like the rest!
          
          Cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and
          struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes
          away, passing him back toward the rear of the line.

                          This is a whorehouse, not a stable.
          
          Whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in
          glee. As he maniacally lashes out at his good-natured molesters,
          the blood from Cameron's face smears a whore's body.

                          Cut!
          
          Instantly everything stops. Cameron is sprawled half-naked on his
          knees at the end of the line. Enraged, he whirls toward Eli who has
          caused this humiliation. Then the CLAPPING begins, the CAST and
          CREW applauding his stunt. People slap him on the back admiringly.
          A robe is thrown around him. He is helped to his feet. Suddenly
          Nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the
          mouth.
          
                                     NINA

                          die!
          
          He is pulled away from her by the backslappers. Now Cameron is
          responding to this strange new sensation -- the warmth of public
          acclaim. He regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't
          noticed. Chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on
          Cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake
          blood inside; the "wound" is gone. He starts feeling Cameron's
          shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.

               There is general laughter.    Eli, raising his arm like a referee.

               Eli continues toward Cameron.    Chuck is spraying ethyl chloride on
               his bare tattooed shoulder.

                                Eli, that this vulgar little scene

                                  God knows, Sam. Maybe...because you
                                  get the feeling that the enemy might
                                  just be some poor horny slob like

                                  did it taste like kraut?
          
                 The crew laughs and so does Nina.    Cameron feels humiliated by Eli's

                 Mechanic nods toward a door at the rear of the garage. Eli pats the
                 fender of the Duesenberg. Cameron views it with a strange sense of
                 unease. Putting his arm around Cameron's shoulder, Eli leads him
                 toward the back door yelling to mechanic.

                Hazily, through the restless shifting limbs, male and female, like
                the first rays of morning sun breaking through to the depths of the
                forest, we glimpse Raymond and Gabe shooting their eight millimeter

                his hands up in despair.

                against it to get in.

          104   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It is Harvey standing in the doorway with Nina.

                                 Hey Chief, ya lookin' for me?
          
                Nina tries to peer over the heads of the crowd, pushing into the
                room. Cameron steps toward her without thinking. He wants her out
                of there.
          
                                            NINA
                                 What's happening?   What's going on?

                                 Still got your makeup on?
          
                Nina, who by now has seen what's happening, laughs.
          
                                            NINA
                                 That's a daring touch, Raymond!    The
                                 rowboat. Terribly symbolic.
          
                There is general laughter, but not shared by Cameron. He
                surprisingly finds himself angry at Nina's presence here and
                everyone's easy familiarity toward her. She sees Cameron and Eli
                through the smokey dimness and works her way toward them smiling.
                Eli puts his arms about her shouting over the din.

                                 Remember the sunglasses and garter
                                 belts back when we got our start?
                                 Make you nostalgic?
          
                More laughter.   Nina turns to Cameron.

                                 Hi Lancelot. What's a nice boy like
                                 you doing in a place like this?
                                 Going to rescue the maiden from the
                                 boat?

                          It's Eli's potty training class.

                          own personal crapper.
                             (Cameron starts to exit)
                          Have yourself a time...Just wallow
                          around in it, man. Watching you
                          makes me feel like Mr. Clean.
          
          Cameron storms out in a rage. Eli watches with a thoughtful smile.
          Sam, who has witnessed the outburst, turns to Eli, furious:
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Goddamn little prudish bastard!

                          human condition. We just hide it
                          better.
          
                                     SAM
                          ...Are you kidding?...If That guy in
                          the rowboat was a Marine sticking a
                          bayonet in her instead of a cock,
                          that uptight son-of-a-bitch would
                          have saluted.
          
          Eli starts laughing.

                          Goddamn you, Eli.   That's not funny!
          
          He grabs Eli by the shirt front, cocking his fist.

                Sam's anger fades to a sheepish grin, realizing he's fallen into
                Eli's trap. Where his daughter is concerned, he's just as prudish
                as Cameron. Eli snaps an affectionate headlock around Sam's neck.

                With hardly a pause, he turns.

                pushing his way through the crowd.

                On the folding chairs facing the PORTABLE SCREEN, a dozen people are
                silhouetted against the light from the projected dailies. Cameron
                enters, pausing so his eyes can adjust to the dark.

                In the dimness, Nina sits separated from Eli, Sam and a few others.
                On the screen, a World War I British biplane in steady flight is
                interrupted by a couple of subliminal cuts. Another subliminal
                flash holds and replaces the scene on the portable screen. It's a
                "NUDIE" SHOT -- a rear view of the lady taken in the rowboat the
                night before.

                The watchers all break up, recognizing the work of Raymond and Gabe.
          
                                              GABE

                As Nina laughs good-naturedly, the airplane is back on the portable
                screen.
          107   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Involuntarily smiling to himself and now less uptight about last
                night, he walks over and sits down beside her.

                Without even glancing at him, Nina gets up and moves to a chair some
                distance away. He is stunned, then angry. Then confounded. Then
                resigned to the ways of women, he goes over and sits beside her.

                                   you as an equal go to your head.

                 On the portable screen, Raymond in helmet and goggles is in the
                 cockpit of an airplane. He stuffs a bottle of champagne into a
                 leather flying boot, dangles the package over the side and lets it
                 go. Raymond looks down and salutes (like that famous scene in
                 "WINGS").

                 Eli's voice yells 'cut' on the sound track. The angle on the
                 portable screen widens and we see that the airplane sits on the
                 ground with an electric fan blowing wind in Raymond's face.

                 Now the scene on the portable screen changes: from the ground, we
                 see the same biplane flying low. An object drops from the cockpit
                 (the boot). Then there is a burst of flame in the engine. Trailing
                 smoke, the plane wobbles, crash-lands (sliding alarmingly close to
                 CAMERA). It ground-loops, goes up on one wing and, as it crashes
                 down, we see that the pilot who we assumed was Raymond, is really a
                 dummy that is flapping absurdly and falling to pieces before our
                 eyes during the crash. There are groans, laughter and raspberries

          109   (SHOCK CUT TO SKY) - CLOSE ON GERMAN FIGHTER PLANE - DAY
          
                It screams down vertically, full power, machine guns blazing, then
                smashes into the earth, shredding to fragments hurled in every
                direction. The dead German pilot is flung crumpled to the ground.
                The plane's carcass explodes, filling the screen with fire and black
                smoke through which we see a brightly colored PARACHUTE descending.
                The FIGURE dangling beneath it passes through the smoke and flames
                and tumbles to the ground, rolling, his parachute now ablaze. It is
                Cameron dressed in a British flyer's uniform.
          110   ANGLE WIDENS
          
                To show the hand-held Arriflex at Gabe's eye, Eli behind him,
                steering Gabe by the back of his belt and carrying the battery pack
                as they photograph Cameron shedding the harness. With the camera,
                they crouch and move together like a three-headed, four-armed, four-
                legged creature.
          
                Banking steeply, a British fighter roars past Cameron, its wingtip
                almost brushing the ground, machine guns rattling, driving some
                advancing German soldiers back toward the woods.
          
                The plane touches down to rescue Cameron, the pilot beckoning.
                Cameron has pulled off the dead German pilot's boots and helmet.
                Stray bullets strike about him as he sprints to the idling British
                plane. It is a single-seater. It starts to pick up speed. He
                grabs a strut and scrambles up onto the lower wing.
          
          111   ANGLE ON CONSTRUCTION CRANE
          
                The bucket hanging from the giant CRANE descends. Smoothly Eli
                guides Gabe backward, seating him in the bucket. The bucket rises,
                lifting Gabe while he photographs the scene, as the plane with
                Cameron on the wing becomes airborne.
          112   ANGLE ON PICKET FENCE
          
                Behind it is a CROWD OF SPECTATORS who jump up and down shrieking.

          113   ANGLE ON CRANE BUCKET AND BRITISH AIRPLANE
          
                The giant arm of the crane swings and rises with the plane,
                completing Gabe's spectacular shot. Now we see a HELICOPTER drop
                into frame, photographing the plane from the other side. The
                chopper and the vintage British plane bank together in perfect tight
                formation with Cameron standing spread-eagled between the wing
                struts like a flying Christ, as they soar into the sun.
          114   ANGLE ON CAMERON
          
                Seated on the wing, his back against he fuselage, legs firmly
                against the struts. His white silk scarf streams into the tearing
                wind. Jamming a champagne bottle into the German's boot, he holds
                it up. The pilot grins approval, popping the cork on a second
                bottle which spouts foam into the slipstream. Laughing, he passes a
                glass to Cameron and pours from above. The liquid is lost in the
                wind. Shrugging, he swigs from the bottle and hands it to Cameron.
                Cameron drinks. The champagne pours down his throat and face and,
                holding the strut with one hand, he rises to his feet.
          
                The pilot waggles his wings, giving Cameron a seesaw ride to get his
                bottle back. Cameron now seems drunk. He lets go of the strut and
                stands leaning against the wind. As the pilot toasts his courage,
                Cameron's balance falters and he grabs the strut.
          
                Now, Cameron picks his way through the guywires toward the end of
                the wing. Then he bounces up and down, rocking the plane. The
                pilot starts to sing to Cameron's rhythm, "How ya gonna keep 'em
                down on the farm..." And Cameron dances the Charleston.

                going through its antic maneuvers.

                CLOSE ON BIPLANE
          
                Cameron holds the boot poised, lets go. Then, the pilot is struck
                by a bursting shell. As he slumps over, the plane skids and slips
                and drops off into a spin. Cameron clings for his life as the
                sickening momentum grows, until his feet are flung out from under
                him and he dangles from the wing, whipping in space.
          117   WIDE ANGLE
          
                Suddenly it becomes clear how what we are seeing is possible -- the
                airplane is no longer in flight, but is dangling a few feet above
                the ground, suspended from the cable of the huge crane. The crewmen
                shove at its tail and wingtips to keep it revolving. Cameron is,
                indeed, clinging to the wing strut, his feet held in space by the
                centrifugal force. But, if his hands slip, he will fall ten feet
                instead of to certain death.

                As the spin slows down and the plane appears to level out, Cameron
                regains his footing, perches on the wing and looks forward in
                growing horror.

                We see the rapidly approaching trees. Closer and closer, until with
                a horrendous crash, the plane sails between two trunks, shearing off
                the wingtips, the nose smashing into another, hurling Cameron off
                the wing like a crumb flicked from the table.

                Apparently hurtling through the air, his eyes widen at the impending
                impact. A gasp and then a sharp cry. But instead of the
                crash...the ANGLE WIDENS and we see it is Cameron reaching orgasm.
                With extreme contentment on his face, he rolls over revealing Nina,
                who, it is clear, has also had a lovely time.

                Cameron gets up, moving toward the dresser to turn off the clock,
                but instead stops at the stand holding the Old Lady wig. He runs
                his fingers through it as the clock continues to ring.

                                lady?

                                this American flyer. I'm Austrian...
                                Will ya turn off the clock?
          
                Subtly, we sense something is bothering Cameron.    He ignores the
                still-ringing clock.

                          Anyway, his patriotism is stronger
                          than his love and he leaves me with
                          another little patriot in my belly.
          
          During this he has taken the wig and puts it over his head, glancing
          in the mirror.

          He does.

                          The clock's electric. It'll ring
                          forever.
          
          Instead of turning off the clock, he crosses to the Old Lady's dress
          on a hanger. He looks at the dress appraisingly.

                          Eli might really go for that, the
                          big soldier as a little old lady.
          
          Disturbed, Nina leaves the bed, turns off the alarm clock and
          adjusts the wig properly on its stand.

          They embrace and cling to each other. She starts back for the bed,
          but he detours for the clock and pulls out the alarm again, and
          again it BEGINS RINGING.

                          get shot out of a cannon.
          
          With the alarm still ringing, he starts toward the bed.

                          yelling for you to work on your
                          scene and us saying, "Up yours,

          The whole idea is so incongruous that she starts laughing. He gets
          on the bed with her. THE ALARM CONTINUES TO RING. They struggle
          about, giggling at the absurdity.

          While he moves over her body, she grabs a pillow and hurtles it at
          the clock. It falls over, but keeps on ringing. By now, Cameron
          has entered Nina and she is rapidly becoming more involved in that,
          than in the clock.

                 CLOSE ON MOVIOLA
          
                 In the darkness, the machine is like an ominous hunchback,
                 splattering shards of light against Chuck's intensely watching face.
                 He is highly disturbed at the unseen image.

                 ANGLE WIDENS, showing a small STORAGE ROOM has been converted to a
                 makeshift EDITING ROOM, where Chuck sits working the MOVIOLA.
                 Slowly becoming aware of someone, he glances up through the spinning
                 reels and dimly sees Cameron leaning in the doorway.
          
                                               CHUCK
                                    There was no way it could go
                                    wrong...unless he just went ape.
          
                 Cameron ambles over as Chuck reverses the film to see it one more
                 time. Even as he catches a glimpse of the film whirring backward,
                 he realizes he's seeing BURT'S DEATH SCENE in the water. Now Chuck
                 has reached the beginning of the film and is moving it forward
                 again.
          125A   CLOSE UP - VIEWER OF MOVIOLA
          
                 The film whirs as we see through the windshield over Burt's
                 shoulder, the car flying through the air, hitting the water and
                 sinking beneath the surface. Burt goes through the motions of a man
                 trying to free himself.

                 Sweat is running down Cameron's face.    Finally, with dread...

                                 What about it? Probably from the
                                 impact. No water coming in.
          
                Cameron's face reflects immense relief. At least he's not guilty of
                that. The flung stone was not the cause. Now, abruptly, Burt's
                body begins to move more violently.
          
                                            CHUCK'S VOICE
                                 There! Look at that. He's starting
                                 to panic. Will you, for Christ's
                                 sake, tell me why?
          
                As Chuck slows the film, we see Burt's head duck beneath the view of
                the underwater camera, leaving only the steering wheel and
                windshield. For an instant, the current changes the light and the
                crack glows brightly, like a spider web. Burt reappears, his face
                now toward camera, wild with terror. The slow motion lends a
                bizarre elegance to his agony. Abruptly, the FILM GOES BLACK.

          127   INT.   REHEARSAL HALL - DAY
          
                In one of the private DINING ROOMS off the lobby, tables and chairs
                are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in
                progress. Some early morning TOURISTS have gathered outside the
                entrance, watching. A few members of the kitchen staff peer through
                an inside doorway. Sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as
                Eli rehearses with Nina.

          the floor.

                          What's left is a single memory...
                          that brief bright love.
          
          Nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. Among the
          tourists at the doorway stands Cameron, who has paused to watch, his
          costume slung over his shoulder. He nods to her with a small tender
          smile. Subtly, so Eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews
          her concentration.

                          wildflowers or something.
          
          Sam crosses over to them and kneels beside Eli and Nina.

                                 let me show you this...
          
                From a paper bag, he takes a SMALL BRONZE CASTING of a BEAR and A
                GIRL on a SWING beneath a tree. He sets it down.
          
          128   INSERT ON THE BRONZE
          
                Sam's hand presses a lever on the side of the bronze. There is a
                whirring of the clockwork and a music box melody plays. The girl
                begins to swing. The bear slides toward her. She mechanically
                lifts her bronze dress until they meet, performing their clockwork
                love rite. Nina giggles.
          
                                            SAM'S VOICE
                                 It's authentic. Early Victorian.
                                 Mechanical bronzes were quite a
                                 thing.

                Eli shakes his head patiently, kindly.
          
                                            ELI
                                 Sam, you'll get a belly laugh.
          
                                            SAM
                                 What do you mean?   It'll break their
                                 hearts!
          
                Eli begins to beam. Sam, realizing he has again fallen into the
                trap, winces, chagrined. Eli grabs him in a bear hug.
          
                                            ELI

                Sam struggles to escape from the iron grip as Eli dances him about
                in joy.

                Denise, with spray can and fingertips, is massaging in red dye, as
                the CAMERA PULLS BACK.

                                got a set call in forty minutes.

                To include a MAKEUP TABLE against the far basement wall with THREE
                ACTORS sitting at it, wearing plastic aprons to shield their
                uniforms.

                                   (to Cameron)
                                You just sit here...dry...and
                                repent.
          
                She crosses to the men at the makeup table.
          
                                           ACTOR
                                Glad ya could tear yourself away.
          
                                          DENISE

                                 Don't panic. He's still got that
                                 whole big emotional thing to do with
                                 the dog food lady before they even
                                 get to you. You may not work 'til
                                 midnight.
          
                                            ACTOR
                                 You wait. Eli'll wave his wand and
                                 get it out of her in five minutes.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE
                                    (trimming his hair)
                                 You're confused...He got it into her
                                 in five minutes. To get it out of
                                 her...it takes longer.
          
                There is general knowing laughter as Denise crosses back to Cameron
                and sees by the look on his face she has hit her target. The
                thought of Nina and Eli as lovers had never occurred to Cameron.
          
                                            DENISE'S VOICE (CONT'D)
                                 Oops...somebody didn't know...
          
                The effect is stronger than she had expected.     Now compassion sets
                in.
          
                                            DENISE (CONT'D)

                                 scorned...I'll say anything.
          
                Cameron just sinks back in the chair, slowly dying.

                Over the tinkling sound of the music box, the BEAR and MAIDEN
                perform their ritual as the CAMERA PULLS BACK revealing the
                GRAVESTONE decorated with the worn filmy lace undergarments of
                another era. They flutter in the soft wind and amber light of a
                summer afternoon, strangely beautiful against the mossy granite
                marked "UNKNOWN." Somehow these rotting women's underthings have
                the dignity of a sacred tapestry draping an altar.
          
                                            OLD LADY'S VOICE

                                 beautiful...
          
                The ANGLE WIDENS and we see Nina, now made up to look wrinkled and
                gray, tragically old, her eyes moist as she kneels beside the grave.

                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                             (sudden deep sincerity)
                          Why do I lie? I couldn't wait
                          either. I think both of us are
                          bears.
                             (a soft nostalgic smile)
                          Go, young maiden, you'll be late for
                          your piano lesson.
          
          An elegantly-dressed CARIBINERRI (ITALIAN POLICEMAN) appears.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora...signora...
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          I'm almost finished.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Signora. This desecration... some
                          flowers perhaps...would be
                          permitted.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          But, we want these.
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                          Please, signora. It's not right.
                          The grave is unmarked.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Ask the driver how many graves we
                          visited today. I could have chosen
                          five hours ago. I came here and my
                          soul said, "Oh yes." I know that is
                          hard to believe...
          
                                     CARIBINERRI
                             (shrugging)
                          Anything is possible, signora.
                             (tries urging her to her
                              feet)
                          Now, you must permit me to escort
                          you to your car.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          As soon as I am gone, you will take
                          everything away.
          
                                    CARIBINERRI
                          No...
          
                                       - 84 -
          
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                             (tears streaming down her
                              face)
                          You will, and I can't stop you, and
                          it's wrong. We loved each other...
                          Where else should these go?
          
          The unexpected sound of laughter makes her turn to see a SMALL GROUP
          OF PEOPLE who've gathered beside their PARKED CARS watching.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Yes, I know I'm ridiculous, but you
                          laugh without knowing anything. You
                          would buy a plastic wreath for a man
                          of such importance.
          
          She pulls free of the Caribinerri and, trying to kneel down,
          stumbles and falls. Now, like some confused child, she searches
          among the garments. Taking a SCROLL from a wooden box, she shakes
          it at them like a schoolteacher would a ruler.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          President Wilson...from the
                          President of the United States...for
                          heroism. To me for sheltering
                          him...
                             (smiling to herself)
                          How silly. I 'sheltered' him to be
                          with him. He was my beloved...Where
                          is it?...Oh, here, did you see this?
          
          She now holds up a fist from which dangles a swastika on a sash.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          Given to me by Adolf Hitler...for
                          our son. Our son...
          
          Her voice suddenly fierce with the pain of that memory.
          
                                     OLD LADY (NINA)
                          ...Our son!!!
                             (then, with simple
                              reverence)
                          ...A thousand years of peace...is
                          what he said. That would be very
                          nice.
          
          The Caribinerri, spellbound, has taken a backward step, bumping into
          a REFLECTOR, which now teeters and falls into the scene, knocking
          off his hat, barely missing the Old Lady and crashing across the
          grave and shattering all illusion. The Caribinerri stands there
          
                                             - 85 -
          
          
                with his eyes closed and his fists clenched, wishing he were in the
                grave. Nina stands in speechless horror.

                                           ELI
                                ...and print.
          
                It's deadly silent as Eli walks over to Nina.    They stare at each
                other for a moment.
          
                                           ELI
                                   (eyes brimming over)
                                Thank you, baby.
          
                They fall into each others arms like lovers never do.
          134   MEDIUM - CAMERON WATCHING ELI AND NINA EMBRACE
          
                Everybody is applauding, wild with joy over Nina's great
                performance. Tears of happiness run unabashedly down Sam's nose.
                Only Cameron is sullen, seething with anger and jealousy as he views
                them in the light of his recent information.

                                farmhouse!
          
                Cameron is standing aside, while Nina vainly looks around for him.
                Denise is unpinning her wig. Chuck approaches Cameron.

          Cameron, still watching Nina and Eli in the now dwindling circle of
          admirers, doesn't answer.

          135   ANGLE - EXT.   FARMHOUSE - DAY
          
                As it explodes, Cameron is BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL -- ON FIRE. He
                tumbles to the ground, frantically writhes, rolls, trying to smother
                the flames, finally collapsing in some wagon tracks filled with
                muddy water. Cameron lifts his head at the approach of a THUNDERING
                SOUND...an ENGLISH CAISSON hurtles toward him, the driver dead and
                mangled over the barrel of the gun, the horses insane with terror.
                Before Cameron can move, the charging horses are on top of him. He
                rolls between their hooves, the giant steel wheel of the caisson
                barely missing him. Shells from a cannon barrage are bursting all
                about. Cameron staggers to his feet and scrambles over a low stone
                wall for protection, drops to the other side and then hurtles into
                the air as the wall is shattered by an exploding shell.

                As Cameron falls into the shot, landing on a hidden TRAMPOLINE near
                the stone wall, bouncing up and down 'til he finally comes to rest.

                Cameron stares over the edge of the trampoline as Henry, the
                assistant cameraman, uneasily faces Eli.
          
                                            HENRY
                                 We had a film run-out.

                                 How many feet are left in that

                Eli advances murderously on the assistant cameraman, building to a
                rage we have not seen in him before.
          
                                            ELI

                                 going to do this to me? How dare
                                 you yell cut on my set?

                                Thirty-six feet is nothing...
          
                                           ELI
                                It's twenty-two seconds! In twenty-
                                two seconds, I could break your
                                spine...I could pinch your fucking
                                head off like an insect and smear it
                                on the pavement...I could put

                Cameron is so intrigued that he hasn't realized an EMBER is burning
                through his asbestos protector, until suddenly he feels the flame
                and frantically begins beating it out and thus, is even denied the
                pleasure of savoring Eli's anguish.

                trouble with Cameron and that she might be at fault, she has decided

          139   WIDER ANGLE - INT.   CAMERON'S AND SAM'S ROOM
          
                Sam has stopped typing and sits silently, waiting for the storm.
          
                Cameron lies on his bed in a T-shirt and shorts, an elastic bandage
                around his knee and an ice bag at his neck, coldly watching Nina's
                performance as she grandly moves through the doorway into the room.

                          unexpectedly to honor me on the
                          occasion of my birthday...but don't
                          feel too badly. As consolation for
                          a lovely evening missed, I'm

                          of-the-month" award.
          
          From behind her back, she takes an APPLE with a tiny cocktail
          parasol stuck in it and holds it out to Cameron. Cameron lies
          glaring at her with mounting rage.

                          one's privates when accepting an
                          award? It's one of the common

                          What should I congratulate you for?
                          The fucking scene or for fucking the
                          director?
          
          Nina stands there shaken, looking at him sadly.
          
                                     NINA
                          For fucking the director, honey.

                          girls get into the movies?
          
          She leaves. Cameron lies there seething, then abruptly leaps up and
          storms into the bathroom. Sam sits rubbing his head, resumes
          typing. Cameron rages out of the bathroom, flings himself onto the
          bed. Unwinding the elastic bandage, he sprays ethyl chloride on his
          knee. Sam's typing stops.

                          they were lousy as lovers. But they
                          had a problem. They liked each
                          other. They recognized some area of
                          mutual sensitivity. I'm boring you.

                          I think he 'banged' her twice to
                          confirm the awful truth...Was she
                          supposed to be a virgin?
          
                                    CAMERON
                          Yeah...
          
          But he says this so sadly and looks so miserable that Sam knows he
          has reached him and it touched.

                                    I had a virgin once. Had to go to
                                    Guatemala for it. She was blind in
                                    one eye and had a stuffed alligator
                                    that said, "Welcome to Miami Beach!"
          
                Cameron sits there feeling dumb and full of regrets. Then he gets
                up, goes to Sam's closet and begins rummaging through the clothes.
                Sam watches him curiously.

                The pleasant SEAFOOD RESTAURANT is on the pier over the water.
                Cameron, now wearing Sam's sweater after all, is searching about the
                crowded room trying to find Nina and what might be her family. He
                is about to leave when he sees a group at a window table, a MAN and
                WOMAN in their early fifties and a FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD GIRL,
                attractive despite the baby fat. Something about the composite of
                all their features is familiar enough to give them a second look.
                In doing so, he sees a half-eaten BIRTHDAY CAKE on their table, in
                front of an empty place. He goes to the table.

                                I was sort of invited to a birthday
                                party and I can't seem to find
                                it...and this seems to be a birthday

                                She's really worth finding, ma'am.
                                She's a very rare mineral.

                                           CAMERON
                                This morning she was acting about
                                ninety, but she might be lying a
                                year or two.
          
                The father now really comfortable, recognizing a fellow humorist.

                                No, you got the wrong table...this
                                one's acting like she's six...but
                                the missus tells me birthdays are
                                very emotional for the ladies.
          
                At this moment Cameron can tell from their faces that they've seen
                Nina behind him. He turns.

                Nina has emerged from the ladies' room looking miserable and is
                walking toward them. At the shock of seeing Cameron, her hand flies
                to her mouth in such embarrassment and joy and confusion at the way
                she feels, that she starts back to the refuge of the ladies' room.
                Catching herself, she turns back to face him, her eyes now glowing
                with tears of happiness.

                He moves forward and kisses Nina. We now realize we are at her
                HOTEL ROOM DOOR. She on the inside, he on the outside, kissing
                through the doorway, which stands slightly ajar. With their mouths
                barely parting:

                On HENRY (the ASSISTANT CAMERAMAN who Eli screamed at), his luggage
                beside him, his elbows, empties, loose change scattered before him
                on the bar top.

          ANGLE shifts to include Cameron a few stools down.    He looks up from
          his beer and crosses to henry.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Guess who tole 'em to take their job
                          and stuff it?

                                     HENRY
                          Fuckin' A. Gettin' out tonight.
                          But not without splittin' a Schlitz
                          with the one guy, 'cept me, who
                          wouldn't take shit from that
                          screwball.
          
          As the BARTENDER is taking away the empties, Henry puts his finger
          down on a DIME.
          
                                     HENRY (CONT'D)
                          Change is for you, except that.
                          That's a very special dime.
                             (holds it up for Cameron
                              to see)
                          Know what this is? Ask me!

                          It's a dime...am I close?
          
                                     HENRY
                          It's Eli Cross' ass. People think
                          'cause you're easygoin' they can
                          walk all over you. Bull-shit...I'm
                          blowin' the whistle with this dime
                          in that phone...killin' a man and
                          hiding it from the police...are you
                          kiddin'...? Who is he think he is?
          
          Cameron pales, knowing that drunken Henry's desire for revenge can
          expose him to the police. He grabs the dime from Henry's fingers
          and drops it into a PEANUT VENDING MACHINE.
          
                                     HENRY
                          What the hell you doin'?
          
          Cameron stuffs the bag of peanuts in Henry's shirt pocket, grabs his
          suitcase and hustles him out of the bar toward the FRONT DOOR.

                          bitch to me!
          
          They have reached the HOTEL DOORWAY.   By now, Henry is convinced
          Cameron means business. He stops.
          
                                     HENRY
                          Do whatever you wanna do, but I
                          better do it with ya! You'll need
                          help 'cause that goddamn looney is

                          living in pictures, but I don't give

                                      (Cameron is wide-eyed)
                                   I could tell from up there in the
                                   chopper something' was wrong. So, I
                                   stopped shootin' and that crazy man
                                   gets me by the throat and starts
                                   screamin' to roll the film...I mean
                                   that guy's down there dying and he's
                                   screamin', "Keep shooting! Keep
                                   shooting!" Then, he starts fighting
                                   me for the switch and it falls
                                   down...like a crazy house up there,
                                   with him thrashin' on the floor...He
                                   didn't care about Burt. All he
                                   cared about was to get that man
                                   dyin' on film! Sickest thing I ever
                                   seen!
          
                As Henry's last words sink in, Cameron stands pale and shaken.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   I better grab that cab.
          
                Henry takes the suitcase from Cameron's numb hand and pushes through
                the door, looks back for a parting shot.
          
                                              HENRY (CONT'D)
                                   You tell 'em everything...don't
                                   mince words...
          
                As he goes towards cab, some MERRYMAKERS push their way into the
                lobby.
          144   CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                Staring ahead, Henry's words echo like his own death warrant. The
                merrymakers jostle past him, discussing suntan ointments. Cameron
                turns and walks across the HOTEL LOBBY and UP the STAIRS...his pace
                increasing until he is taking them three at a time.
          
          145   CLOSE ON DOOR LOCK
          
                Cameron's hand thrusts KEY into the hole, flings open the DOOR TO
                NINA'S BEDROOM and barges in.
          
                                              CAMERON
                                      (overwrought)
                                   Nina...your crazy Eli...
          
                                               - 97 -
          
          
                 He FREEZES. Over his shoulder, we see Nina, naked, lying on the
                 bed. Raymond, also naked, sits slumped on the edge of the bed,
                 utterly disconsolate. The three stare at each other, an absurd
                 tableau. Cameron whirls and leaves, slamming the door behind him,
                 almost off its hinges.
          
          146    INT.   HOTEL LOBBY
          
                 He comes down the steps like a madman. Raging, Cameron stomps
                 across the lobby toward the glass doors that will take him out of
                 Eli's grotesque wonderland. He collides with a group of returning
                 night FISHERMEN still in their slickers, carrying their equipment,
                 their catch wrapped in newspapers. For a moment he is tangled in
                 their tackle, FISH TUMBLING AND SLIDING along the marble floor.
          
                                             FISHERMAN
                                  Jesus...don't step on 'em.
          
                 Cameron stares at them, whirls and rushes back across the lobby and
                 up the stairs.
          
          147    INT.   NINA'S BEDROOM
          
                 As Cameron bursts in.   She stands in her robe in the center of the
                 room, glaring at him.
          
                                             NINA
                                     (screaming)
                                  Get out of here!
          
                 Hearing WATER running in the bathtub, he dashes in, but finds the
                 bathroom empty. He moves to the closet and slides the door so
                 violently that it almost falls off: No Raymond.
          
                                             NINA (CONT'D)
                                  Get out!!!

                                  I'll have you thrown out!
          
                 She crosses to the phone.
          
                                             CAMERON
                                  Is there anybody in this whole
                                  company you haven't screwed?
          
          147A   In the HALLWAY, a little group of PASSING TOURISTS turn in
                 wonderment at the tumult through the open doorway. Nina leaves the
                 phone, crosses to the door and kicks it shut in the people's faces
                 with all her strength.

                          me in a raffle?!
          
          Cameron, realizing for the first time that instead of being ashamed
          or frightened, she is livid with rage?

                          ballin' last night.

                          He came scratching at the door
                          tonight like a beaten dog, begging
                          me to say that you were some twenty-
                          four hour nonsense.

                              starts to cry)
                          ...and I had to tell him I thought I
                          was falling in love with...

          Nina lets out an incoherent roar of rage.

          Cameron crosses to the door. Searching through this madness for
          some kind of logic, turning on her.

                 They sit there unable to leave each other, unable to move to each
                 other. They just sit there.
          
          148    INT.   BASEMENT SCREENING ROOM - MORNING
          
                 Dailies are in progress. Eli watches, surrounded by a few crew
                 members. Cameron sits in the back row with Nina's MOTHER, FATHER
                 and SISTER. Nina is not present. On the PORTABLE SCREEN is a shot
                 of Nina as a wild, radiant eighteen-year old Austrian girl running
                 pell-mell along a willow-lined VILLAGE STREET, dodging children and
          148A   bicycles. She collides with an OLD MAN, her basket falls, its
                 contents scattering; his momentary anger vanishing as he is infected
                 with her joy of life. He helps her refill the basket and she
                 rewards him with a sausage and a kiss. The old man watches her
                 wistfully as she runs away.
          149    ANGLE ON PARENTS
          
                 There's a tear of pride in Nina's mother's eye. Father gently puts
                 his hand on top of hers as the room lights come on.

                The room dims and the film starts. We see a slate board reading
                "150A Take 1." The clapper claps and the board is removed,
                revealing an ATTIC. Nina sprawled on her stomach, stark naked, atop
                Raymond's naked body, her breasts resting on his chest, her legs
                apart, interlocked with his. They look directly at the CAMERA
                awaiting their cue with the calm resignation of two people waiting
                for the Wilshire bus. The MAKEUP GIRL appears in the shot spraying
                Nina's back and ass with glycerin sweat from an aerosol can. She
                disappears as Eli's voice on the sound track calls, "ACTION." The
                ANGLE TIGHTENS into a less revealing, more artistic composition.
                Their mouths meet. Their bodies writhe.

                They stare at the screen in open-mouthed shock and horror. Their

                away the nightmare.

                She's now made up to look like a woman in her forties. Everything
                about her tells us these have been brutal years, filled with pain
                and loss. She is reacting in anguish to something O.S. But, even
                though she manages a few tears, it doesn't quite ring true. Eli
                steps into the shot.

                Hands reach in and drape a sash around Nina's throat. From it
                dangles a SWASTIKA. For Nina, there is still no voice, no camera,
                only the obliterating shame for that image of her naked body burned
                into her father's memory. And yet, that shame is so similar to the
                shame she should be feeling as the woman in Eli's film at this
                mockery of her son's death.

                The THUNDEROUS SOUND of ten thousand voices shouting: "Sieg Heil!

                her personal despair has been used to accomplish an acting trick,
                and it only adds to her degradation and sense of shame, ironically
                making her performance even more poignant. The crowd on the

                          A pamphlet on how to get out of a
                          sunken car. You know, they got this
                          problem in Holland...those canals.

                                     ELI
                          Off hand, I'd say no, wouldn't you?

                Eli pushes open the double doors and they find themselves standing
                in the MAKESHIFT SCREENING ROOM.

                                 You've gotta think positive, Burt.
          165   INT.   SCREENING ROOM
          
                Jake is there with SEVERAL OTHER MEN. But before Cameron can even
                register who they are, Eli is saying...
          
                                            ELI
                                 I'm sorry, gentlemen, but I've got
                                 exactly two minutes of borrowed
                                 time. I'm in the middle of a scene.
                                    (to projectionist)
                                 Get it started.
          
                Immediately the lights snap off and the film is projected on the
                screen. In the dark, the men in the room fumble their way to seats.
                On the projection screen we see a helicopter SHOT OF THE DUESENBERG
                APPROACHING THE BRIDGE. Cameron is suddenly alert like a jungle
                beast who's just heard the trap slam shut behind him. His eyes dart
                around at the official-looking faces staring at the O.S. film. One
                face looks disturbingly familiar, but in the dark he can't place it.
          
                                            JAKE
                                    (addressing a man next to
                                     him)
                                 This fellow here is the stunt man
                                 driving that car.
                                    (to Cameron)
                                 Thompson is from the FBI. They
                                 wanted you here in case they have
                                 any questions.
          
                On the projection screen, we see the DUESENBERG GO OFF THE EDGE OF
                THE BRIDGE, disappear in the water.
          
                                            THOMPSON
                                 I don't see anybody else on the
                                 road...did you, Burt?
          
                                              CAMERON
                                 No.
          
                                             - 108 -
          
          
                The MAN Cameron couldn't recognize speaks out.
          
                                           OTHER MAN
                                My buddy and I saw that son-of-a-
                                bitch break out of the woods and
                                head that way, down the road.
          
                The lights go on and Cameron looks at the speaker, recognizing him
                as one of the TELEPHONE LINEMEN. Apparently, the lineman doesn't
                recognize Cameron in his new identity.
          
                                           LINEMAN
                                ...I had a clear view.     I was on top
                                of the pole.
          
                                           THOMPSON
                                Do you mind if we see that again?
          
                                           ELI
                                Help yourself, the room is yours.
                                But I've got thirty people on the
                                set being paid for doing nothing.
                                   (moving toward the door
                                    and calling)
                                Come on Burt, you've got some
                                reading to do.
          
                Cameron follows Eli as the lights go out and the film begins again.
          
                                           JAKE
                                Hey Burt, glad you're still alive,
                                considering who you're working for.
          
          166   INT.   HALL
          
                Cameron moves swiftly down the corridor behind Eli, who starts up
                the stairs, still blithely chewing his gum.

                                 Good boy. I got all kinds of
                                 versions. Wanna go back and see
                                 some?
          
                 Cameron understands the implied threat and Eli, knowing he has made
                 his point, continues good-humoredly.
          
                                            ELI (CONT'D)
                                 I've even got a version where you
                                 fly the helicopter and I'm driving
                                 the Duesenberg. It's a dilly.
          166A   They have now charged out of the building and are racing across the
                 grounds toward the set.

                                 What about the version where I go
                                 over the bridge and die in the
                                 water?

                                 Because you don't like my tatoo.
          
                                            ELI
                                 I think it's beautiful. It's
                                 heroic! I think it's a major work
                                 that may rank with the Edsel grill!
                                 Now goddamnit, I gotta go back and
                                 do my picture! Will you take this
                                 thing and read?!
          
                 He holds the booklet out to him and it is very hard for Cameron to
                 reach out and take it. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees the
                 FBI MEN leaving the building, heading off in another direction. He
                 stares at the booklet.

                                he could do was just stand there.
                                It was getting light. If we didn't
                                get out, we'd of been shot up. So
                                we left...
          
                Eli has been watching him thoughtfully.

                Eli blows a BUBBLE with his gum that POPS on cue as though it were
                the explosion of the bouncing Betty. Grinning, he sticks the
                booklet in Cameron's shirt pocket, turns and walks off.

                Scattered about the room are suitcases, a wardrobe trunk, the almost
                completed packing for tomorrow's departure. Nina lies in bed
                staring into nothing, Cameron beside her. Each is talking aloud to
                himself, adrift in his private world, unaware they have lost contact
                with the other. The room is semi-dark, except for the nightstand
                light on Cameron's side, by which he studies the BOOKLET Eli gave
                him.

                                 Vitalis. But this from Eli...it was
                                 so pointless...sadistic...

          way...like a gadget...Why would Eli
          do that? He's not a cruel man...

                          strangled a man because he stopped

                          what he was crying about?! 'Cause

                          wasn't over Burt. He was crying
                          over losing his fucking shot!
          
          To keep from exploding, Nina opens her luggage and furiously starts
          repacking.

                          What his film is all about? He's

                          know if he is doing it consciously,
                          but it's a hell of an idea. If he
                          can really get it on film, a genuine
                          dumb fuck grunt cashing in, before

                          with one stone. It's got a nice
                          logic. Trouble is, both birds are
                          me.
          
          Against her instincts, Nina is emotionally affected by what Cameron
          says.

          He walks over to the still-stricken Nina and tenderly embraces her.
          She leans against him, the trembling subsiding.

                          looks gassy on film. You got your

                          it would show on camera. So when

                          yourself against the steering wheel.
                          It's reinforced. You couldn't break
                          it loose with dynamite...you gettin'
                          light-headed yet?
          
          Cameron shakes his head, "No."
          
                                     CHUCK
                          Keep your hands off the doors...
                          You're leaving through the window.
                          You lower them slowly as you sink to
                          equalize the pressure. What are you
                          waitin' for? I'm not gonna be down
                          there holding your hand.
                             (Cameron lowering
                              windows)
                          Slower. When you hit bottom, the
                          windows are open and you're gonna
                          make like a minnow. But first, a
                          little fresh air wouldn't hurt. You
                          reach down under the seat and, what
                          do you know, a respirator...Make
                          like you're reaching for it.
                          There'll be one there tomorrow.
          
          Cameron reaches for the non-existent respirator.
          
                                     CHUCK (CONT'D)
                          No, keep your face forward, the
                          camera is behind you and it's still
                          running.

                 By this time, Cameron's breath is giving out and he's struggling to
                 hold it.
          
                                            CHUCK (CONT'D)
                                 You feel like your lungs are gonna
                                 burst? Good. That's the way you're
                                 supposed to act like you feel. The
                                 moment that water gets above your
                                 nose, you gotta look like you're
                                 drowning. Remember? Burt wasn't so
                                 good at that.
          
                 That knocks the wind out of Cameron.

                The POLICE STATION comes into view, seen through the window of the
                company car, which slows as it moves toward the curb. Eli, sitting
                on the front stoop, leans wearily against the stone lion. As he
                sees the car approach, he moves toward it quickly, opening the door
                almost before it stops.

          172   INT.   POLICE STATION
          
                As the three enter. The station is old with a high sergeant's desk
                and wooden benches against the walls. Raymond, beyond tears,
                destroyed, sits among the other refuse of the night: derelicts,
                stoned kids, etc. On one bench is a SAILOR, with that adenoidal
                look that betrays the weakness he tries to hide with his "butch"
                arrogance. Jake, in the doorway of his office, savors the fact that
                he has finally nailed Eli Cross. Eli captures the setup in a
                glance...then, instant theater. He strides across the police
                station to Raymond, takes his head in his hands and kisses him smack
                on the mouth.

                Gabe has come up behind a PATROLMAN, grabs him by the hips and
                starts humping like a dog in heat. The policeman shrieks in dismay
                and tries to escape, but Gabe trots along as if they were locked.

                Gabe is now distracted by the sight of the sailor, who is agape with
                growing disbelief. Gabe ogles him.

                                 ...Your man over there touched his
                                 genitals.

                She is snuggled against him tenderly, her open mouth kissing his
                neck and cheek. Raymond, although aware of his desperate situation,
                is too sick with self-loathing to respond.
          175   ANGLE ON ELI AND JAKE

                                 Oh, Jake! Come on! You wouldn't
                                 know your anal invert from a hole in
                                 the ground. Raymond makes bad
                                 jokes, but they're not illegal.
                                 Christ, you've seen us all on the
                                 set...clowning around.
          176   EXT.   POLICE STATION
          
                Cameron stands, peering in through the big front window, feeling
                once again betrayed. It's like watching TV with the sound shut off.
                From here, Nina and Raymond are very convincing. Chuck leans
                against a lamppost, smoking a cigarette, as the charade goes on.

                Eli pays no attention, knowing that he's got Jake.     He gestures
                toward Nina embracing Raymond.

                                 Jake, I got a very horny leading
                                 lady who's got an early call and
                                 would like to spend some time with
                                 her boyfriend before she makes
                                 "night-night." Now, can I please
                                 get 'em outta here before they
                                 really do something illegal...and in
                                 front of witnesses!
          
          178   INT.   HOTEL CORRIDOR - ON ELEVATOR DOORS - NIGHT
          
                It's three o'clock in the morning. The corridors are empty as the
                elevator door swings open and Nina and Eli step out and move down
                the hallway, functioning on their last ounce of nervous energy.
          
                                            ELI
                                 Sorry I had to put you through that.
                                 I know it was humiliating.
          
                                            NINA
                                 ...It was awful...I hated it.   But
                                 you did save that man's life.

                          Yeah, that was really nice of me.
                          I'm a nice person. I just wish I
                          had the strength to go to his room
                          and break his spine. On the last
                          day of filming the queen decides to
                          come out of the closet! Wouldn't
                          that have made a lovely headline?
                          You understand, of course, that the
                          film would've been destroyed. Doing
                          that to me...

                          Eli, what's wrong?
          
                                     ELI
                          Nothing serious.     Just a little
                          self-indulgence.     Feel-sorry-for-
                          Eli-time.
          
          Eli, on the edge of nervous exhaustion, is actually close to tears.
          
                                     ELI (CONT'D)
                          I'm sorry, but you know...it's too
                          goddamn much. Why's everybody on my
                          back? When's somebody gonna say,
                          "There, there Eli?" I'm really
                          surrounded by friends, allies and
                          you..."What else can I do for your

                          That's not fair.
          
          They have reached a turn in the corridor where each would go his
          separate way. They stop.

                          feelings "hurt?" When did I lose
                          you to that soldier boy, Nina? That
                          nice, wholesome, swell-looking
                          kid...wanted by every cop, the FBI

                          knows what crime.
          
          Nina is paralyzed with shock.

                Partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing
                film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. In the
                cavernous half-lit room, Cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy
                animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases,
                pulling them aside, searching. Discovering one, he sets it on the
                floor. It's locked. With a metal bar, he breaks the lock and
                eagerly rifles the contents. Then, sensing a presence, he turns.
                There stands Nina at the base of the steps watching him. With only
                a glance to her, he goes on with his search.

                Cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of
                suitcases. He pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the

                 contents on the floor. Now with the open bag on his arm, he goes
                 along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket,
                 stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple
                 of work shirts, a heavy jacket. Passing a shelf of bayonets, he
                 picks one out and throws it in the bag.

                          Eli'd tell you...I was a soldier. I
                          did the same as everybody, just one
                          of the boys... emptied my M-16 at
                          any sound... don't know whether I
                          killed gooks or cherries...the new
                          kids from the States, we call 'em
                          cherries, which they were for maybe
                          fifteen minutes. The dry season is
                          when it really breaks loose. You
                          get very tired. It's like falling
                          asleep at the wheel. You close your
                          eyes and it still goes on. You're
                          killin' them, they're killin' you.
                          Couldn't tell ya now what was real
                          except I'm here.

                                 the grass ran out, I shot the hell
                                 out of a water buffalo.

                                 lotsa pretty ribbons. Funny...sort
                                 of like when I did that first stunt
                                 and everybody started clapping...
                                 nothing like a slap on the back to
                                 ruin a man, blow his sense of
                                 proportion. So, I got home...and,
                                 uh...I guess I expected something.
                                 Nothing fancy, but... something, you
                                 know...a free car wash, double blue
                                 chip stamps, extra time on the
                                 parking meter... I don't know...

                                 too pleased.

                                   fast. Christ, I nearly swallowed my
                                   heart. That second I was sure...it
                                   was Charlie...a cigarette butt, some
                                   guy on a V.C. Patrol!...
                                      (his panic subsides)
                                   Know what it was? It was the

                                   being the damn good soldier the
                                   judge said I was, yes sir, people
                                   sitting there on their fat asses
                                   feedin' their fat faces. "Can I
                                   have an extra cherry? Can I have an
                                   extra cherry?"
          
                 Cameron rips Denise's electric hair dryer from the wall and hurls it
                 across the basement.

                                   I smashed that fucking fudge pot
                                   across the room, smack into that
                                   shelf full of animals...and it
                                   starts raining pussycats and monkeys
                                   and kangaroo cookies like Noah's
                                   Ark!
          
                 The   hair dryer smashes against a shelf, toppling ammunition boxes
                 and   bottles onto the carcass of a disassembled World War I airplane.
                 The   propeller topples and falls through a German recruiting poster,
                 and   just out at the Kaiser's crotch.

                 Cameron's hands have come to rest on a metal laundry bin.   He grips
                 it and lifts it over his head.

                                   I picked up this fifty-pound ice
                                   cream vat...FLAVOR-OF-THE-MONTH!...

                                   I started running with that son-of-

          Cameron starts running across the room and just as he's about to
          hurl it, he COLLIDES with a jutting shelf, which knocks him flat on
          his back. The shelf falls and thirty or forty one-gallon PAINT CANS
          cascade on top of him. It looks disastrous. Nina runs to him,
          terrified, but before the last can has even come to rest, Cameron
          emerges from the pile of cans, throwing them aside, still thrashing
          and screaming as he struggles to his feet.
          
          At the sight of him, Nina starts laughing. But Cameron, who has
          somehow managed to keep his grip on the laundry basket, raises it
          over his head as if nothing has happened, hurls the clothes bin,
          screaming:

                          SCOOP THAT UP YOUR ROYAL BAVARIAN
                          STRAWBERRY SNATCH!
          
          With the effort, Cameron's feet fly out from under him as if he had
          stepped in oil. In fact, he has stepped in paint, and lands flat on
          his ass in the green goo. Nina "bracks" out an uncontrollable
          guffaw.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (bellowing)
                          It's not funny!
          
          Shamed, Nina runs to him.
          
                                     NINA
                          Oh, baby...
          
          But, as she reaches him, her feet too are caught in the paint and
          she slides forward like an ice skater, spraddling him, landing on
          her ass. His rage vanishes as he points at her, breaking into a
          fiendish, uncontrollable cackle. These pratfalls are a catharsis
          that has released the pressure and the madness. They attempt to
          gain their feet, skidding and sliding in the paint. He succeeds,
          but Nina fails.

                          gonna have an accident.

                          You'll miss the main part! Killer
                          Cameron's ghastly crime! I was
                          freaked out of my head! And,
                          suddenly there's this big flashlight
                          shining in my face. I just grabbed
                          that goddamn ice cream bucket and
                          slopped it...right over the guy's
                          head!
          
          Although Cameron's got nothing in his hands, he pantomimes swinging
          that fifty-pound ice cream bucket around in the air, losing his
          balance and landing on his back in the paint beside Nina. Her
          hysteria is renewed, but Cameron stops laughing.

                          a shot. I didn't know he was
                          knocked out. How the hell did I
                          know he was gonna lay there all
                          night with his head in the ice
                          cream?

                          froze, see...and...
          
          Despite the horror of it, Nina starts giggling.   She can't help it.

          179H   Then, Cameron, realizing the absurdity, starts giggling too. Out of
                 control, Nina scrambles to her feet and dashes for the ladies room.
                 Cameron follows her to the door, still talking as it closes behind
                 her.

                 Abruptly, Cameron's energy is gone. The hilarity is over.   He leans
                 his forehead against the door in exhaustion and despair.

                 The DUESENBERG STANDS silhouetted in the darkness, light glinting
                 dimly off it like the gleam from fine wood of a splendid coffin
                 waiting in the slumber room before services begin. Behind it, a
                 side door of the garage opens. But it is not visitors coming to pay
                 their last respects, it is Cameron and Nina. He is wearing Burt's
                 clothes.
          
                 Nina moves quickly to a WHITE CONVERTIBLE as Cameron crosses to the
                 big overhead garage doors and hits the electric SWITCH. NOTHING
                 HAPPENS. He flips another switch and harsh overhead lights
                 illuminate the reality of the garage. Nina has started the
                 convertible, as Cameron tries to lift the garage door handles.

                 Nina gasps. Cameron whirls towards the voice. A COP with a big
                 flashlight stands in the open doorway peering in at them.

                          and wrote something else like -- "At

          181   EXT.   THE OLD ABANDONED ROAD - EARLY MORNING
          
                In the stillness, as the morning sun crests the trees, their shadows
                move like a parting curtain, leaving sunlight to warm the old stones
                of the abandoned road. The ancient bridge spans the black river,
                idling toward the sea. It is a perfect day, tranquil except for the
                faint distant "rumbling" intruding into our consciousness. As it
                grows louder and LOUDER, a flock of birds is frightened from the
                trees, a rusty beer can by the roadside begins to tremble and roll
                from the vibration.
          
                Rounding the bend of the road into view are a half-dozen kids on
                bicycles, peddling furiously, laughing and yelling and looking back
                at what now appears behind them: the first vehicle of an incredible
                carnival parade -- or is it a funeral procession? Long, short,
                tall, fat vehicles; the stretch-out car, the cab towing portable
                toilets, the tractor pulling a generator rig, the Cortez Camper
                dressing rooms, the stake-bed loaded with reflectors rattling like
                radar screens, panel trucks with studio emblems, a vintage German
                army truck filled with soldiers, patrol cars and motorcycles, the
                huge, bright yellow construction crane on its Caterpillar treads,
                its pneumatic snout jutting forward thirty yards like a morning
                hard-on sniffing around for some tunnel to hump -- a few technicians
                straddle it having their morning Danish and coffee. In the midst of
                these, on a low-slung flatbed trailer rides the Duesenberg -- the
                coffin on its caisson.
          
                The caravan grinds, hisses, wheezes to a halt and the A.D., astride
                the hood of the first vehicle, dismounts and raises his electric
                bullhorn to begin what will be an incessant squawking of
                instructions, reprimands, coaxings and complaints.

                Cables are being strung out of sight along the side of the road,

                Gabe, Chuck, the A.D. and a Technician move down the road toward us,

                                Where's the chopper? We'd kinda
                                like to have you join us...if you
                                can find the way.

                                Fifteen minutes, Eli. We're just
                                warming her up.
          
                Eli grabs an electric horn from the hand of a passing A.D.
          
                                           ELI
                                All right, everybody...may I have
                                your attention, please?
          
                Instantly the frantic A.D.'s begin squawking, "Everybody put down
                what you're doing, the director wants to talk."

                                This is the one and only Duesenberg
                                we have in stock. When that car
                                goes into the water, we're not going
                                to see it again. So, once the
                                action starts, no matter what
                                happens, keep it going.

                As Cameron steps out through the open doorway, buttoning his
                costume.

                                Therefore, I now order no camera to
                                jam and no cloud to pass before the

          189   LONG SHOT ON THE DUESENBERG
          
                As Cameron moves toward it uncertainly. Eli, some distance away,
                surrounded by members of his crew, glances up.
          
                                           ELI

                                learn to do without sleep?
          
                Without awaiting an answer, Eli returns to his work, as Cameron
                approaches the Duesenberg.
          
          190   CLOSE ON DUESENBERG
          
                Cameron walks around it, testing and checking, but moving
                relentlessly toward the humpback trunk. A horn honks and a police
                car slides up. Jake leans out the window, waves at Cameron
                jovially.
          
                                           JAKE
                                How do you guys get accident
                                insurance? Must cost you an arm and
                                a leg...
                                   (chuckling)
                                ...that's a good one.
          
                He drives on toward a parked German army truck, in which lounge
                several soldiers. Chuck approaches Cameron.
          
                                           CHUCK
                                You're lookin' real strong, kid. Is
                                that loose change I hear jinglin' or
                                are they beginnin' to grow?
          
                                           CAMERON
                                   (flatly)
                                Wanna check?

                                C'mon, lemme show you this truck...
          
                They walk towards the German truck.
          
                                           CHUCK (CONT'D)
                                I'm sending it on ahead. During the
                                gag, it's gonna be comin' down the
                                road towards you when you get to the
                                bridge.
          
                Cameron tenses at this information.

                                 Relax, what does it change? I'm
                                 only tellin' you so you don't buzz
                                 off into space when you see 'em.
                                 They'll be shooting at you and
                                 that's what's supposed to make you
                                 go into the river.
          
          190A   They've reached the truck where Jake stands proudly. The Property
                 Man is handing out rifles and boxes of bullets to the German
                 soldiers, whom we now recognize as police officers from the town.
                 One cop, tying his shoe, lifts his head and grins at Cameron like an
                 old buddy -- the officer from the garage last night.
          
                                            COP
                                 Hey, you ever get those pancakes?

                                 How could I say no, after all the
                                 crap they've taken because of this
                                 company the last six weeks?

                                    (good-naturedly)
                                 Yeah, a cop'll do anything for fifty
                                 bucks, even be an actor.
          
                                            SECOND COP
                                 These guns are kinda modern for
                                 World War I.
          
                                            PROPERTY MASTER
                                    (to Chuck)
                                 You want me to drive back and get
                                 the old ones.

                                 see from the helicopter?
          
                 If Cameron was upset by the change in the stunt, he is now really
                 unnerved by the sight of those cops with guns. The second cop is
                 loading cartridges.

                As Cameron arrives and casually leans against the trunk and then
                gently taps. He must get Nina out of there. With determination, he
                reaches for the trunk handle. Arms wearing the same costume as his
                own reach in, holding the trunk closed. It is Raymond.

                                    you, she's still there. If she
                                    doesn't...then it doesn't really
                                    matter...does it?
          
                How can he know?     -- Everything is out of control -- a voice calls.

          The technician tightens a final screw on the red light then, leaning
          back out of the car, yells O.S.

                             (to Cameron)
                          Does it work?
          
          Cameron, barely hearing, looks straight ahead without response.
          Jake lounges at the driver's window, kibitzing the operation.

                          What?
          
          The words "CAMERA ON" sound exactly like "CAMERON." It sounded as
          though his real name was called and he automatically answered. Has
          his identity been exposed? His eyes widen. The technician, getting
          no response, calls to Jake.

          He whirls to see Jake staring at him. His hand darts to the
          ignition key, the engine roars to life.

          Cameron realizes his error, but it's too late, he's in a panic. In
          his mind, he's given himself away. The road ahead is clear -- GO!
          He jams the car in gear and slams the accelerator to the floor. The
          Duesenberg leaps forward, screeching wildly. In its wake -- chaos.
          Everyone running, yelling...

                Speed. The needle hits sixty-five -- seventy -- climbing fast.
                Cameron grips the wheel, looking at that empty road. An involuntary
                shout swells up and escapes his mouth.

                                    Hang on to everything, baby, we're
                                    on our way! You okay?
          
                The needle hits eighty -- eighty-five. Ahead, the bridge is rushing
                toward us. Now the arches of the stone railing are strobing past.
                Through them, he sees the black river which he has escaped.
                Triumphantly, his hand rises, middle finger extended. Suddenly the
                red camera light goes on, the underwater camera behind him begins
                whirring. He moves his finger behind him for a perfect close-up,
                (recalling that moment in the tower):

                The center of the bridge is an instant away, an approaching blur.

                Crouching -- tensely watching the chalk line on the road as the

                Blam! The whole front wheel of the car is blown off by an explosive

                The Duesenberg drops on one axle. Metal screams against stone, as
                though it were Cameron himself, screaming. Skidding, spinning,
                tearing through the papier-mache railing, plunging out of control
                into space, where it hovers for a brief instant and arcs downward
                like a dying bird.
          197   INT.   DUESENBERG - CLOSE ON CAMERON
          
                A cry of such anguish and despair.

          198   INT.   DUESENBERG - WIDE ANGLE PAST CAMERON THROUGH WINDSHIELD
          
                The river rushes up and the car smashes into it with a deafening,
                shattering roar, plunging beneath the surface to a dark and
                soundless world -- except for a tiny red light, the whir of a camera
                and Cameron's desperate cries. Tearing his seatbelt off he flings
                himself toward the rear of the car, clawing at the back seat to
                reach Nina. Incredibly, there is sunlight again as the car is
                buoyed to the surface. There, again, is the living world - the
                road, the trees. In that brief instant, through the rear window,
                Cameron has a wild, tilted glimpse of a pink pinafore -- Nina,
                standing by the rail looking down, Eli beside her. The car noses
                downward, water rising swiftly over the rear window. The last image
                on Cameron's retina is that wild, eager, little-girl excitement on
                Nina's face. Then he's alone again, entombed in the darkening water
                as the car plunges toward the bottom.
          
                Cameron sits, immobilized at the realization that his betrayal is
                total. Everyone, even Nina, has conspired to bring him to this --
                red light glowing, camera whirring, to capture the moment of his
                death.

                Outrage galvanizes him to action. He reaches for the door handles,
                to rip them open -- they snap off in his hands. Now there is a
                rumbling and rending of metal as the roof begins to implode,
                crushing down toward him. Under the immense pressure, the rear
                window bursts inward, the river rushing in a wild torrent. The
                memory of Chuck's voice..."the windows." He lowers the front window
                slowly. The water now pours in faster. The level has risen to his
                chin. He gasps a final breath and the water rises over his head.
                Still the red light burns. He reaches beneath the seat for the
                oxygen cylinder and tries to pull it loose. It won't move. The
                impact of the car hitting the water has bent the seat frame. His
                groping hand finds the hose, the oxygen mask. A hope. Though every
                second is robbing his chance for life, his movements under water are
                as in slow motion. Pulling the mask to his face, he takes an eager
                breath and chokes as water fills his mouth. The rubber tube has
                broken loose from the cylinder and is floating free -- as it must
                have with Burt. Pressure of the onrushing water has stopped as the
                water reaches the roof. For a moment there is a strange stillness
                which Cameron, his lungs bursting, swims through, out the window and
                toward the surface.

                Moving upward through river slime, in a world that grows lighter, in
                a desperate race to reach air.
          
                Daylight! Gasping, half unconscious, barely able to move his arms
                to stay afloat. Adrift in the current, he touches land, clawing at
                the rocks and pulling himself onto the shore. His muscles, still
                moving by motor reflex, driven by survival instinct, take him
                crawling from the river bank through the tall grass -- still the
                fugitive, the "man on the run." Then, he lifts his head and stops
                at what he sees before him:
          
          200   POV
          
                Fanned out across the field is a row of men, guns held ready.
                Policemen from the truck in their German uniforms moving forward
                slowly -- carefully searching the terrain in an arch which, as it
                closes, must irrevocably reach Cameron.
          201   ANOTHER ANGLE
          
                It's over. Without strength or will, he lies waiting for them as
                though his eyes were made of glass. They see him now, but their
                pace doesn't change. As they take the last few steps toward him, he
                sees their shoulders, waists, knees and then only a circle of feet
                around him.
          
                Their hands roughly grab him, pulling him to his feet, shoving him
                brutally about. Angry cop faced growling: "Kill the son-of-a-

                bitch," "Shoot 'im," "Cut it," "Hang 'im," and then loudly, "Cut
                it!" He feels a blow on the back, then another. They seem too
                gentle. Why is that cop smiling? Some of them are walking away.
                Where are the handcuffs? Why is he shaking my hand instead? Then
                the jumble of voices is becoming clearer..."No matter what they pay
                you, make 'em give you a raise!"..."Fantastic, my wife thinks being
                a cop is dangerous -- you guys are terrific!" It finally sinks in,
                the insane, absurd, devastating, humiliating realization that it was
                all just another scene in a movie that came off as planned.
          
                He is alive and free. Is that gurgle we hear in Cameron's throat
                the water that he swallowed or an unseemly giggle? Then it chokes
                into laughter.

                who runs to meet him. How hilarious. There's the pink

                As Cameron tilts his head back, the bottle to his mouth, he sees
                skin divers setting down their rescue equipment and stripping out of
                their dripping wet-suits.

                restore his circulation, replies with the highest compliment he can
                pay?

                losing a shoe, ripping her hose -- and then wildly into the arms of

                                           ELI
                                "How!" I have always had a great
                                compassion for your people. Long
                                before it was popular, I felt a
                                repugnance for General Custer.
          
                Cameron stares at him, incredulous.
          
                                           ELI (CONT'D)
                                My God, I think he's breathing.
                                There're days I can't do anything
                                right. I hope this doesn't screw up
                                our relationship, your being alive
                                and all.

                          Eli...why didn't you just let me go
                          last night?

                          What, with Nina in the trunk? I've
                          got scenes to shoot with her...

                          I knew a guy who made an anti-war
                          film. When they previewed it in his
                          hometown, army enlistment went up
                          six hundred percent. I'm making
                          this film trying to convince the
                          whole world that maybe there's a
                          better way to get home for
                          Thanksgiving...and I can't even
                          convince one dumb kid with a
                          tattoo...I couldn't have you run
                          around paranoid the rest of your
                          life thinking I was trying to kill
                          you.

                                     ELI
                          Hey Sam, the kid just licked your
                          screenplay. He named the disease.

                          way...by screwing your fellow man.

                          That was the hardest thousand bucks
                          I ever made.
          
          A horn honks. It is Jake who, in his enthusiasm, has driven the
          police car bumping over the marshes to Eli and Cameron.
          
                                     JAKE
                          You guys want a ride back?

                              helicopter)
                          No, we're goin' in the chopper.
          
                                     CAMERON
                             (considers it)
                          Thanks, Eli, but that looks too
                          dangerous. I think I'll ride with
                          Jake. Good luck with the picture.
          
          He moves toward police car.
          
                                     ELI

                              to yell at Eli)
                          He better not! Any member of your
                          company found within city limits
                          after five o'clock tonight, gets
                          shot on sight!
          
          Eli stops, suddenly registering what Cameron had said.

          Eli is climbing into the helicopter.

                          use people! I want my money, a
                          thousand bucks!

                          Rewrite the battle scene and let the
                          tank run him over! The stunt pays
                          six-fifty!
          
          The helicopter takes off, zooms under the bridge, up into a
          hammerhead and soars back, while Cameron continues to scream at it.
          
                                     CAMERON

          Eli's voice on the helicopter's P.A. speaker echoes through the
          canyon, as the chopper cavorts overhead and skims away.

1   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE - DAY                                            1

    ROSE LORKOWSKI, 30, drives through Albuquerque. She passes
    small adobe houses, the Air force base, parched earth
    playgrounds, University cafes and other distinctive sights.

    On the   highway she passes under the freeway interchange, a
    tangle   of rust and turquoise ramps. The Sandia mountains rise
    in the   distance as Rose heads up to the nicer neighborhoods
    of the   foothills.


2   EXT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - DAY                                     2

    Rose pulls up to an expensive looking Spanish style house and
    parks. She gets out of the car, pops the hatch and pulls out
    a vacuum cleaner and assorted cleaning supplies.


3   INT. SEVEN FIGURE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                       3

    Rose drags a vacuum cleaner into a room where expensive decor
    collides with the debris of a recent party.

    She collects beer bottles from end tables, book shelves and
    house plants. Cigarette butts float in cocktail glasses.

    Rose plugs in the vacuum cord and glances out the sliding
    glass doors. A group of twenty somethings frolic in the pool.

    A lanky trust funder slides open the door and drips water
    onto the carpet as he makes his way to retrieve a cold beer.

    He brushes past Rose on his way back out. Rose turns on the
    vacuum and wonders if he even saw her.


4   INT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                   4

    The space is packed with every kind of snack imaginable. JOE
    LORKOWSKI, 53, talks as the OWNER stocks shelves.

                          OWNER
                I've got the five stores here and
                then two in Rio Rancho.

                           JOE
                 That's fantastic. See, if we're
                 talking that kind of volume I can
                 absolutely massage the numbers a
                 little. Seriously, you're not gonna
                 be able to keep it on the shelf.

    Joe pulls out some order forms.

                           OWNER
                 Yeah, I'd need to look at some
                 things before I can place an order.

    The owner looks at Joe's business card.

                           OWNER
                 How about I give you a call if I
                 decide to--

                           JOE
                 I'll call you. Not a problem. No
                 problem at all. Even better, I'll
                 swing by. You're on my route. How
                 `bout that? I'll swing by tomorrow.

                           OWNER
                 Yeah, tomorrow's not good.

                           JOE
                 Thursday then. That's better
                 anyway. That'll give you a chance
                 to take a look see on those other
                 stores. We'll put everything on one
                 order and get you a good price
                 break.

    The owner seems to consider the offer. Joe scans the shelves.

                           JOE
                 My advice to you - weed out some of
                 this weaker product to make more
                 space for the corn. Like this...

    Joe reaches over and grabs a packet of organic fruit bar.

                           JOE
                 Apricot Fruit Leather. Whose bright
                 idea was it to stock that? I mean
                 come on, what self respecting kid
                 asks his mom for apricot fruit
                 leather?

    The owner is not amused.


5   EXT. FAIR N SQUARE MARKET - DAY                                 5

    Joe pulls a hand cart stacked high with Fancy Corn canisters
    to his rusted Monte Carlo.


6   EXT. LUCKY BOY RESTAURANT - DAY                                 6

    Through the glass pane we see disgruntled waitress, NORAH
    LORKOWSKI (25). She appears to be in a heated argument with
    MR. KIM, the restaurant owner. A customer watches the
    exchange with amusement.

    Norah takes off her apron, throws it at Mr. Kim. Norah exits
    the restaurant. Mr. Kim trails her. Then MRS. KIM notices and
    joins the fray.

                        MR. KIM
              You are fired.

                        NORAH
              I so don't care.

    Norah flips him off and walk down the street. As she
    continues to walk she realizes that quitting her job might
    not have been the best decision ever.

                        NORAH
              Fuck.

     A banana floats in the toilet. OSCAR LORKOWSKI, 7, smiles and
     kicks the flush lever. Whoosh... the banana is sucked down
     the drain. Gone.

     Well, not quite. Oscar watches water fill the basin and spill
     onto the floor. Oscar turns and walks out.


8    INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                           8

     Oscar steps from the bathroom and walks quickly down the
     empty hall.


9    INT. BUSINESSMAN'S CAR -   SPORTING GOODS STORE LOT - DAY        9

     A BUSINESSMAN removes a single shotgun shell from the glove
     compartment. He drops it in his shirt pocket, sprays breath
     freshener in his mouth and gets out of his car.


10   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY                                  10

     The businessman approaches the gun display and points to a
     shotgun. An employee hands him the gun and turns his
     attention to another customer.

     The businessman reaches into his pocket and pulls out the
     shotgun shell. Loads it. Draws the barrel up under his chin.

     A Bubba pricing camouflaged vests nearby notices the
     businessman. His expression shifts from concern to alarm to
     horrible anticipation. He braces for the...

11   INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - LATER                                11

     Police mill about and question people. CARL SWANSON, a 40ish
     man sporting a crew cut and a `Above and Beyond' polo shirt,
     talks to the STORE OWNER.

                         CARL
               Yep, these shotgun cases are a real
               pain in the ass. What we call a
               wide field of contamination.

                  Guy's all over the place and every
                  little glob of him's a biohazard.

     The owner rubs his temples.

                            CARL
                  Gonna lose some inventory.

                            OWNER
                  Selfish bastard.

                            CARL
                  Trust me, you do not want some lady
                  suing you cuz she found this guy's
                  tooth in her brand new fanny pack.

     A ABOVE AND BEYOND WORKER in a polo shirt waves his arm to
     get Carl's attention.

                            CLEAN SWEEP WORKER
                  He's over here in fishing too.

                            CARL
                  Yep, a real pain in the ass.

     Carl walks over to his assistant. Detective, `MAC' MACDOWELL,
     approaches the owner.

                            MAC
                  We're wrapping it up.

                            OWNER
                  Three grand just to have the
                  asshole wiped up off the floor. Can
                  you believe that?

     Mac and another DETECTIVE walk toward the entrance.

                            MAC
                  Hey, can you handle the report
                  tonight? I gotta thing I gotta do.

                            DETECTIVE
                  A blonde thing or a brunette thing?


12   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                              12

     Rose steps from the shower. She is attractive with sharp
     features and eyes that hint at future crow's feet. Her
     confidence has grown brittle by the gnawing fear that life
     peaked as the captain of the high school cheerleading squad.

     A note taped to the bathroom mirror reads: `You are strong.
     You are powerful. You can do anything. You are a winner.'

     Rose wipes condensation from the mirror to reveal her face.

                            ROSE
                  I am strong. I am powerful. I can
                  do anything. I am a winner.

     She doesn't look like she believes it.


13   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       13

     Norah lounges on her bed and loads weed onto a jerry-rigged
     pop-can-pipe.

                            NORAH
                  The fact that we have sex, real
                  coitus sex, means I'm under no
                  obligation to blow you.

     Norah fires up the bud, inhales deeply and passes the can to
     RANDY, a good-looking redneck in his early 20's.

                            RANDY
                  I think you're scared of it.

     The phone RINGS.

     Norah opens a book about sign language and starts practicing
     the sign alphabet. A-B-C-D-E-F. F is a hard one.

                            NORAH
                      (Holding in the smoke)
                  I'm not scared of it.

                            RANDY
                  Uncomfortable then. You just need
                  to get better acquainted.

     Norah exhales. Randy stands and takes off his pants. The
     phone RINGS again.

                            NORAH
                      (yelling)
                  Dad, get the phone.

                            RANDY
                  There's absolutely no pressure
                  here.

     Randy lies next to Norah naked from the waist down. Norah
     ignores him and continues forming letters with her fingers.
     She jots a note and sticks the pencil behind her ear.

     The phone RINGS again. Norah reaches across Randy and picks
     up the receiver.

                            RANDY
                  You can touch it if you want.

                            NORAH
                      (into phone)
                  Hello.

                            ROSE (O.S.)
                      (through receiver)
                  You haven't left yet? Damn it
                  Norah, my class starts in fifteen
                  minutes.

                            NORAH
                      (into phone)
                  I know, I know.

     As Norah holds the phone her eyes slide from Randy's face to
     his off screen penis. She takes the pencil from behind her
     ear and, in the way you'd poke a hamster to see if it is dead
     or merely sleeping, prods Randy's off screen penis.

     Randy pulls up to a small house and stops. Norah gets out,
     collects the canister from back and heads inside.


16   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       16

     Norah enters the tidy two bedroom house with a barrel of
     Fancy Corn under her arm.

                          NORAH
               Sorry.

                         ROSE
               I'm gonna be so late.

     Oscar runs from the bedroom and flings himself onto Norah.
     Pale and skinny, Oscar is the kind of kid easily picked off
     in slaughter-ball.

                         NORAH
               I brought fancy corn!

                         ROSE
                   (Looking for her purse)
               How can you eat that stuff?

     Norah and Oscar both jam a handful into their mouths.

                         ROSE
               He'll be hyper all night.

     Rose finds her purse and quickly puts on lipstick. She leans
     down and gives Oscar a kiss on the forehead.

                          ROSE
               Be good.

     She turns to Norah.

                            ROSE
                  And no lobsterman stories. He had
                  nightmares all week.
                      (opening the door)
                  Just use some common sense.

     Rose lies on her back being fucked. Her head nearly hits the
     headboard with each thrust.

                            ROSE
                  You want me?

     Rose closes her eyes. Her head starts to thump the headboard.

     Mac comes.


18   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              18

     Oscar and Norah lie in Oscar's little bed. Oscar holds the
     covers tight under his chin. Norah drinks a beer. There's a
     half eaten canister of `Fancy Corn' between them.

                            NORAH
                  He's slowly freezing to death and
                  he knows lobsterman is out there...
                  somewhere... coming for him. And
                  he's totally screwed because his
                  tongue is stuck to the mailbox.

                            OSCAR
                  Why did he lick the mailbox?

                             NORAH
                  I don't know. Maybe he had OCD and
                  he was obsessed with licking
                  mailboxes.

                            OSCAR
                  Why wasn't he in school?

                  Are you gonna let me tell the
                  story?

     Oscar nods.

                            NORAH
                  An then, he hears a horrible sound.
                  Snap, snap, drag. Snap, snap, drag.
                  Lobsterman is coming.

                            OSCAR
                  Maybe he didn't go to school
                  because he had the ACD.

     Norah looks at Oscar.

                            OSCAR
                  Sorry.

     Norah downs the last swig of beer and sets the bottle down
     next to another empty.

                  He's trapped. If he doesn't rip the
                  skin off his tongue and make a run
                  for it lobsterman will tear him to
                  pieces with his razor sharp claws.


19   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                           19

     Curtains drawn in the cheap hotel room. Rose gets out of bed
     and pulls on her clothes. Mac watches for a moment, then
     rolls out of bed. He stops. Grimaces.

                            ROSE
                  Still sore?

     Mac shakes his head and pretends not to be.

                            ROSE
                  I don't know why you did that.

                            MAC
                  You should hear the way he goes on
                  about his lean body mass index
                  bullshit. Drinking that
                  antioxidant, protein powder, enzyme
                  crap all the time.

     Mac limps over to his clothes hanging over a chair.

                  When was the last time you even
                  played basketball?

                            MAC
                  He needed to be brought down a peg
                  or two.

                            ROSE
                  I'm sure you pulling a groin muscle
                  humbled him.

     Rose smiles and Mac pretends to be offended.

                            MAC
                  I should introduce him to your
                  sister.

                            ROSE
                  Norah and a cop? That would happen.

     Mac shrugs and steps into his slacks.

                            MAC
                  We were working a scene today where
                  this guy offs himself in a sporting
                  goods store. So they had this
                  cleaning crew out there, right?
                  You would not believe how much
                  money they charge for that shit.
                  It's ridiculous.

                            ROSE
                  With the dead body there?

                            MAC
                  Naw, the body's gone, it's just the
                  blood and stuff.

                            ROSE
                  Sounds horrible.

     Rose peels the backing off a nicotine patch and carefully
     sticks it on her arm.

                            MAC
                  You ask me it's a racket. You
                  should get into that.

     Rose slips on her blouse looks at Mac.

     Rose steps toward him and eyes Mac as he buttons her blouse.

                         MAC
               You know that's not what I think.

                         ROSE
               I am gonna be a real estate agent.

     Rose rubs the nicotine patch on her arm. Mac nods and smiles.

20   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                          20

     Norah holds a lit joint out the window and watches a cheesy
     TV movie circa 1982. Big hair and leg warmers. Norah leans
     out the window and exhales, takes another toke.

     The sound of a key at the door prompts Norah to quickly stub
     out the joint and close the window. Rose opens the door.

                         NORAH
               It's about time. I thought your
               class got over at 9:30.

     Rose looks at Oscar sprawled out asleep on the couch.

                         ROSE
               Why isn't he in bed?

                         NORAH
               Said he was scared. I think he was
               fakin' it though.

     Rose fumbles in her purse and pulls out a ten-dollar bill.

                         NORAH
               I'm not taking money.

                         ROSE
               It's just ten bucks, take it. Dad
               told me about you getting fired.

                            ROSE
                  What happened?

                             NORAH

                            ROSE
                  What, were you stoned or something?

     Norah waves her hand dismissively.

                            NORAH
                  It was just Mr. Kim being a dick

                            ROSE
                  I thought you liked Mr. Kim.

                  Yeah, before Mrs. Kim started
                  working there. Now he's a full on

                  Shut up and take the ten.

                  There was a diner scene earlier.

                  Any pie?

     Norah smiles and opens the door to leave.

     Rose wraps the vacuum cleaner cord while another MOLLY MAID
     wipes down the last window.

     Through the window, a smartly dressed pregnant woman walks
     toward the house with shopping bags in hand.

     PAULA DATZMAN-MEAD sets her bags down on the table and fishes
     a checkbook from her purse. Rose enters with the vacuum
     cleaner in tow.

                         ROSE
               We're all finished. Since it's our
               first visit we did the blinds and
               appliances but normally we'll
               alternate those weekly. Nobody
               mentioned anything to us about
               laundry so we didn't bother with
               that but if you want laundry
               included there is an extra...

                         PAULA
               Rose? Rose Lorkowski?

     Startled, Rose looks the woman in the eye for the first time.

               It's Paula Datzman... cheerleading

     Recognition punches Rose in the face.

                  I'm not sure...I think he ended up
                  marrying Heather Volkman.

                  Wow. Well it's so good to see you.
                  Let me get your info so I can send
                  you an invite to the baby shower.

     Rose writes her number and address on the scrap of paper.

                            PAULA
                  So what are you doing now?

     Woops. Paula immediately regrets the question.

     Rose caries a vacuum cleaner and bucket of cleaning supplies
     out to a rusted Nissan Sentra with a Molly Maid door magnet.
     She throws the vacuum and bucket in the back hatch, starts to
     close it, then stops.

     Rose walks to the side of the car, peels off the Molly Maid
     magnet and throws that in as well. She looks at the Datzman-
     Mead house with a mixture of resentment and shame.

     She gets into the car and cries. Her cell phone rings. She
     digs the phone out of her bag and tries to steady her voice.

     Rose sits nervously across from the school COUNSELOR, a
     serious man in his mid forties and a TEACHER with cotton
     candy hair. The man speaks first.

                            COUNSELOR
                  It's not just this incident. There

                  There was the incident in gym
                  class.

                            ROSE
                  I did pay the damages for that.

                            COUNSELOR
                  And the chalk thing.

     Rose bites a fingernail.

                            COUNSELOR
                  And the time he locked Jeremy
                  Johnston in the--

                  Okay. What did he do this time?

                  Now it's... licking.

     Rose looks confused.

     Rose looks even more confused.

26   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OUTSIDE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY       26

     The secretary stops typing and offers a sympathetic glance to
     Oscar. He capitalizes on the moment by licking the wall.

                            COUNSELOR (O.S.)
                  It's unsanitary. And it's
                  disturbing to the other children.

     The secretary recoils and returns to her typing.


27   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY               27

     The counselor leans forward with genuine concern.

                            COUNSELOR
                  We think Oscar might benefit from
                  an environment where he could
                  receive more specialized attention.

                            TEACHER
                  He licked my leg.

28   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                              28

     Oscar finds Joe asleep on the Lazy Boy. He snores in that
     scary sleep apnea way ­ holding his breath between snores.

     Oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf
     of a book case. He pulls up a chair to investigate.

     The strap leads to an old pair of binoculars. Behind it,
     dusty books about birds. Oscar grabs the binoculars and
     climbs down.

     Oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too
     far apart. Oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking
     through only one lens. He focuses on his grandpa's nose hair.

     Joe wakes.

                            JOE
                  Where'd you get those?

                               OSCAR
                  Up there.

     Oscar points to the book shelf. Something sad stirs in Joe.

                               JOE
                  Come here.

     Oscar steps closer. Joe twists something on the binoculars
     and pushes the lenses closer together to accommodate Oscar's
     small face. Better.

                            JOE
                  Those were your grandma's. She'd
                  watch birds with those.

     Oscar walks around the room examining various objects and
     clunks them against a lamp in the process.

                            JOE
                  Hey, hey. Careful.

     Joe holds out his hand to retrieve the binoculars.

                            JOE
                  Why don't we put those away.

     Oscar doesn't want to. He hesitates. Joe raises an eyebrow.
     Oscar shuffles back to his grampa and hands them over.

                            OSCAR
                  Why can't I play with them?

                            JOE
                  Because it's not a toy. It's a
                  scientific instrument.

     Oscar's disappointed.

                            JOE
                  You can play with them when I'm
                  around to supervise.

                            OSCAR
                  You're around now.

                            JOE
                  I'm tired now.

     Joe studies the binoculars for a moment and then sets them
     back on the shelf.

     Rose shakes her head and hands Norah another dish.

                            ROSE
                  Well I'm not putting him in special
                  ed. I'll figure out a way to put
                  him in private school before I do
                  that.

                  Rose, you buy generic cigarettes
                  with couch change. How are you

                  Who's going to private school?

     Rose turns and sees her dad leaning in the door way.

      Norah turns to face Rose at the other side of the table.

                                NORAH
                   No thanks.

                             ROSE
                   What do you mean `no thanks'? What
                   else do you have to do? You don't
                   have a job. You don't go to school.

     Rose and Norah step into the apartment littered with dirty
     dishes and clothes.

     Rose walks down the hall while Norah examines a plastic bird
     with top hat. It tips down and drinks from the glass.

     Norah and Rose stand frozen at the threshold. They are awe

     Blooms of splattered blood dry on tile walls. It gathers in
     sticky brown lines around grout. The mirror is broken. The
     shower curtain hangs half torn.

                         NORAH

     Metal shower rings CLINK against the metal bar as Rose pulls

     A rag is wrung out in a bucket of reddish water.

                  Bet you could get a chunk of change

                  Still... How much commission you
                  get on that popcorn? Bet you gotta
                  sell a lot of corn to-

                            JOE
                  Hey, the corn's good. Really good.
                  Not like the pet food but that was
                  a phenomenon.

     The bartender sets a basket of cheddar popcorn in the space
     between Joe and the grizzled regular.

                            JOE
                  It'll get there. Takes time to get
                  to know the market. Develop a
                  relationship with the buyers. But
                  it'll get there. Who doesn't like
                  popcorn for Christ's sake.

                            REGULAR
                  My brother-in-law's in sales.

     The regular scoops up a handful of powdery orange popcorn.

                            REGULAR
                  Last year he buys a cow.

                            JOE
                  Why would you buy a cow?

                         REGULAR
               Not a live cow. A whole butchered
               cow from a rancher. On the hoof
               they call it.

                         JOE
               Mm hmm.

     Joe looks at him with renewed interest.

                         REGULAR
               He sells off the parts of this cow
               to a bunch of restaurants. Direct.
               Made a killing.

     The grizzled man licks orange powder from his fingers.

                         JOE
               What'd he do with the brains and
               intestines?

     Regular shrugs. Joe's wheels are turning.

                         JOE
               So he cuts out the middle man. Not
               a bad idea.

     Joe takes a drink of his beer while he mulls it over.

                         JOE
               Course it'd be smarter to do that
               with something that didn't have bad
               parts. Like... shrimp.


41   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - SIX DAYS LATER - MORNING                    41

     Another day in paradise.


42   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - MORNING                   42

     Norah sleeps in her clothes and makeup from the previous
     night. Knocking wakes her.

                         JOE
                   (though the door)
               Rose is on the phone. Norah?

                         NORAH
               I'm sleeping.

                  She says it's important.

     With great effort Norah picks up the receiver.

                  What do you want?

                            ROSE

                  I'm sleeping.

                            ROSE
                  I'll pick you up in an hour.

     Rose's Nissan rolls down a rough looking Albuquerque street
     toward a trailer park.

     Rose sips her 7-11 coffee. Norah stares blank and blood-shot.

                              NORAH
                  You suck.

                              ROSE
                  Money.

                            NORAH
                  You still suck.

                            ROSE
                  Apparently some crazy bag lady
                  squatter person died and--

     Norah shakes her head in frustration.


45   EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY                                               45

     Rose turns into the trailer park, heads past a row of
     trailers, and parks.

     Rose and Norah get out of the car and approach a particularly
     run down trailer.

                            NORAH
                  How long is this gonna take?

                            ROSE
                  All we have to do is go in and
                  throw everything away. Cake.


46   INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY                                               46

     Rose and Norah open the door and the rancid sweet smell of
     decayed flesh splashes them in the face. They lift their T-
     shirts up over their noses and walk inside.

     Old newspapers stacked to the ceiling. Piles of trash lean
     like snowdrifts against the wall. Cat food encrusted plates.

     Norah opens the bedroom door and peeks in. Flies BUZZ. She
     darts to another room and retches.

                            ROSE
                  Great, now we're gonna have to
                  clean that up too.

     Rose walks into the bedroom, blanches and stifles a gag
     reflex. Norah storms past Rose and out the door.


47   EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY                                               47

     Rose chases after Norah and grabs her arm.

                            ROSE
                  Where are you going?

                            NORAH
                  There is no way.

     Norah shakes off Rose and walks down the row of trailers.

48    INT. TRAILER HOME - DAY                                               48

      Rose pulls her shirt off and wraps it around her head so that
      only her eyes are exposed.

      She strains to open a window that's been painted shut. She
      bangs and pulls but it doesn't budge.

      Rose finds a can of beans and whacks them against the base of
      the window in an attempt to break the seal. Rose grows more
      desperate with each failed effort.


49    EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY                                               49

      Norah watches Rose struggle with the window.

      Pigeons gather at her feet and she gives a little kick.
      Birdseed tumbles on to her shoe. She turns.

      A weathered man sits outside his small rectangular castle and
      tosses birdseed to the pigeons.

                          NORAH
                I'm standing here.

      Norah looks back up to Rose still struggling with the window.
      Finally, Rose muscles it open and throws Norah an angry look
      of triumph. There!


49A   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE STREET - DAY                                      49A

      Joe and Oscar drive to a potential sale.

      Norah ties a shirt around her face as she enters.

      They turn their attention to the discolored mattress
      attracting flies in the corner.

                          NORAH
                What do we do with that?

      Rose shrugs. Looks around.

     Rose and Norah struggle to transport the stinking mattress to
     the dumpster. It is a clumsy process. The thing tips and
     falls on Norah.


52   INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY                                         52

     Tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business.
     Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families.

     Oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to
     Joe and the MANAGER.

                         MANAGER
               You're telling me this Fancy Corn
               stuff is some kind of health food?

                         JOE
               Well, it's a candy... and a health
               food. Absolutely. Absolutely.

                         MANAGER
               Yeah, I don't know. We don't have
               much more shelf space.

     Oscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about
     five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients
     off a Twizzler package.

                         JOE
               Glycerol monostearate? What is
               that? I can't even read that.

     Joe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the
     ingredients.

                            JOE
               Read that.

     The manager leans close.

                         MANAGER
               High fructose--

                         JOE

                  Corn.

                            JOE
                  Exactly. Corn. Can you think of
                  anything more wholesome? It's all
                  American for Christ's sake.

     The manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions
     himself next to the girl.

                            OSCAR
                  Do you know if they sell fancy corn
                  here?

     The girl looks at him suspiciously.

                            OSCAR
                  Do you even know what fancy corn
                  is?

                             GIRL
                  Yes.

                            OSCAR
                  Well, do they sell it here?

                             GIRL
                  I dunno.

     She looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar.

                            OSCAR
                  I heard that the strawberry fancy
                  corn gives you bionic strength.

                            GIRL
                  That's stupid.

                            OSCAR
                  It's true. Some kind of chemical in
                  the strawberry flavoring. If you
                  eat a whole lot of it, it gives you
                  bionic strength.

     The girl gives Oscar a long stare.

                            GIRL
                  I don't believe you.

                            OSCAR
                  I don't care if you do or not.

     The girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and
     tugs her mother's shirt.

                          JOE
               I read where these chemicals are
               getting into the streams, making
               hermaphrodidic frogs! You think
               mothers want to expose their kids
               to that stuff? No way. More and
               more people are looking for healthy
               alternatives which is why the

               Like I said, I already put in all
               the orders I want for this year.

     Just then, the GIRL'S MOTHER walks up to the manager.

                         GIRL'S MOTHER
               Excuse me. Do you carry something
               called fancy corn?

     Joe looks at Oscar. Oscar smiles.

               to throw everything away.

     Rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the
     garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it.

     Norah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the
     ID looks street-worn and crazy.

                         NORAH
               I bet this is her.

     Rose sweeps. Norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls
     out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon.

     Norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school
     photos. Each photo is of a different grade. Norah flips
     through the stack and the girl appears to grow up.

                         NORAH
               Wow, look at this.

     Norah holds the senior photo next to the ID. The resemblance
     between the two is clear.

                         NORAH
               Think it's her daughter?

     Rose looks. Shrugs.

                         NORAH
               Shouldn't we do something? Try to
               find her or something?

                         ROSE
               That's none of your business,
               Norah.

     Rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers.
     She screams and drops the bag. A giant ball of maggots
     writhes at her feet.

                            ROSE
                      (pointing)
                  Hand me that.

     Norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to Rose.

                            NORAH
                  What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't
                  you want to know if this was mom?

     Norah looks closely at the I.D. as Rose deposits trash and
     maggots into the garbage bin. The comparison angers Rose.

                            ROSE
                  Mom was never like this. Mom would
                  never have been like this.

     Norah thinks about that and looks back at the I.D.

                            NORAH
                  I wonder how she died?

                            ROSE
                  Damnit Norah, we still have a lot
                  of shit to do here. Are you just
                  gonna talk?


54   EXT. CANDY STORE - DAY                                               54

     Joe and Oscar roll a handcart strapped with Fancy Corn
     canisters through the parking lot to the car.

                            JOE
                  That was real good. You're a
                  natural. You got the timing, you
                  got the nerve. You're a real sharp

                  No I'm not. I'm stupid.

                  Yes I am. They want to put me in

                            JOE
                  Don't say that.

                               OSCAR
                  What?

                            JOE
                  It's those teachers who are
                  retarded. You're probably just too
                  advanced for those classes. You're
                  bored. Do you get bored in class?

                               OSCAR

                  See. You're too smart! And those
                  teachers just don't know how to
                  handle you. You're probably a
                  goddamn genius.

     Weeds grow in the yard of the small house.


56   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - DAY                    56

     Norah empties the contents of the fanny pack onto her bed.
     She examines the photos and picks up what appears to be a
     senior photo. She turns it over and sees, written on the
     back, LYNN WISEMAN - 1998.

58   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                             58

     Same room as before. Same curtains drawn. Mac unzips Rose's
     skirt and kisses her neck.

                         ROSE
               It was so disgusting. I mean the
               smell, you would not believe.

     Mac's in the sex zone. He unbuttons his shirt and tunes out
     all those distracting words tumbling from Rose's mouth.

     Rose, animated, slips her skirt off and tosses it aside.

                         ROSE
               There were flies everywhere and,
               really, the smell. I can't even
               describe it.

     Mac's shoes hit the floor with a thud. He sets his belt and
     gun on the dresser.

                         MAC
               Shhhh.

     Rose pulls her shirt over her head. Mac kisses her belly.

                           ROSE
               But, after we finished... you woulda
               never even known. We took all that
               away... made it right.

     Mac pulls off his pants. Rose hangs her bra on the back of
     the chair and slips off her undies.

                         MAC
               I can't believe you... I mean, I feel
               like I got you into this mess.

     Her sense of pride wilts. Her hand instinctively reaches up
     to massage the nicotine patch on her arm.

                         ROSE
               No, I--

                         MAC
               Listen, I'm gonna pay for new real
               estate classes. Okay?

     Rose looks at Mac. Shrugs. Mac smiles.

                            MAC
                  We'll get you your license and then
                  get you a little photo in the real
                  estate section. You can drive
                  people around all day and talk
                  about... Gosh, what would you talk
                  about?
                      (Suddenly very serious)
                  Crown molding?

     Rose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke.

                            ROSE
                  Oh yeah, definitely talk about
                  crown molding.

     The phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac.

                            ROSE
                  Property easements, square footage,
                  appliances...

     Mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk.
     He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow.

                            MAC
                  You're holding out on me.

     Rose rolls her eyes and laughs.

                            ROSE
                  Freak.

                            MAC
                  Say it. Come on. One time.

     She smiles and shakes her head. Mac waits. Rose relents.

                            ROSE
                  Curb appeal.

     Mac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose
     laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck.

     He falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand.
     It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where
     his wedding ring isn't.

     Rose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring.

                            ROSE
                  Why'd you pick her?

     Mac looks up. Buzz kill. The residue of a smile fades.

                         MAC
               You know it wasn't like that.

                         ROSE
               How was it like?

     He takes a step back.

                         MAC
               Are you going to do that?

                          ROSE
               No.

                         MAC
               If this is going to get all heavy--

                          ROSE
               No.

     Rose turns around and kisses Mac. One of those soft, teasing
     kisses that ends with a look that kicks things in gear.


59   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY                  59

     Rose pulls her car up to one of many warehouses in the area
     and double checks the address on a scrap of paper.


60   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                   60

     Rose and Norah enter this no frills operation. Cinder block
     walls and concrete floors. A small TV on the front counter
     offers up a not-so-classic afternoon movie line up.

     As they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the
     counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees
     searching for something small and lost.

                          ROSE
               Winston?

     WINSTON, 35, crudely handsome with dark unkempt hair and full
     lips, looks up.

                         ROSE
               I spoke with you on the phone. I'm
               Rose Lorkowski.

     Rose sticks out her right hand.

     Winston stands to reveal he is missing his right arm. He
     clumsily shakes her hand with his left.

                            ROSE
                  So, our situation is...

     On the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and
     Norah both turn and look at the TV.

     The waitress pours coffee and exits the frame without a word.
     Rose and Norah turn back to Winston. Rose continues.

                              ROSE
                  We're doing some postmortem kind of
                  um... specialized cleaning stuff and
                  we had this really difficult...

     Rose looks at Norah and nods.

                            ROSE
                  Really smelly job where the lady
                  had died and they didn't find her
                  for a while and it was really...

                              NORAH
                  Stinky.

                            ROSE
                  The odor was really strong.

                              WINSTON
                  A decomp.

     Rose smiles a little too enthusiastically.

                            ROSE
                  Yeah, a decomp!

     Winston motions them to follow him through the store. He
     indicates points of interest with a flat monotone voice.

               good for vomit.

     The tour ends at the back corner where respirators, safety
     glasses, gloves and Tyvec coveralls crowd the shelves.

                         WINSTON
               And you've got your personal
               protective gear back here.

     The door BEEPS as it opens. CARL SWANSON walks in wearing his
     `Above and Beyond' polo shirt. Winston returns to the
     counter.


61   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - FRONT COUNTER - DAY                   61

     Carl grabs a case of disinfectant and sets it on the counter.
     Winston pulls out some paperwork.

                         CARL
               You hear there're a couple of
               amateurs poaching jobs?

     Winston shakes his head.

     Rose and Norah make their way to the counter with arms full
     of supplies and stand within earshot of Carl and Winston.

                         CARL
               Bruce said they took a decomp for
               five hundred bucks. What do you
               wanna bet they threw all that shit
               right in the dumpster.

     Norah nudges Rose. Carl pays and Rose and Norah watch him
     leave. They step up and set their supplies on the counter.

     As Winston rings them up, Rose notices the shellacked puzzle
     picture of a big white cat on the wall.

                         ROSE
               Hey, I have that puzzle. It's a
               hard one. I think I got lost in the
               white and gave up.

     Rose flashes a `captain of the cheerleading squad' smile.

                  You like cats?

     Winston looks squarely at Rose and steps into the back room.

                            NORAH
                  Great. You freaked him out.

                            ROSE
                  I asked him if he liked cats.

     Winston returns with several books and pamphlets. Hazmat
     Guidelines, Biohazard Recovery and Disposal, etc.

                            WINSTON
                  Bring these back.


62   INT. ROSE'S CAR - DAY                                                  62

     Rose drives while Norah scans one of the books.

                            NORAH
                  Turns out it's against the law to
                  throw bio hazards in the dumpster.
                  Who knew?

     Rose processes the visit.

                            NORAH
                  How perfect was he with the one
                  arm?

                            ROSE
                  Hmm?

                            NORAH
                  The creepy guy. Do you think he was
                  born like that?

                            ROSE
                  I didn't think he was creepy.

                            NORAH
                  Dude, he has one arm.

                            ROSE
                  They think we're just a couple of
                  hacks.

                            NORAH
                  We are a couple of hacks.

     Norah looks out the window.

                               NORAH
                  Stop here.

                               ROSE
                  Why?

                            NORAH
                  I gotta thing. Just drop me off
                  here.

     Rose looks confused but pulls over.


63   EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                            63

     Norah opens the door and slides out.

                            ROSE
                  I'll drop Oscar by around seven.

                            NORAH
                      (sarcastically)
                  You have class tonight?

     Rose smiles uncomfortably.

                            ROSE
                  Mortgage lenders and financing.

     Norah shakes her head in disgust.

                             NORAH
                  Heather's pregnant again. Did you
                  know that? He's never going to
                  leave her.

     Rose clenches her jaw and picks at a crack in the steering
     wheel. Norah gets out of the car.

                            NORAH
                  God, you're pathetic.

     Norah slams the door and watches Rose drive off.

     Norah stands at the door well and scans the apartment number
     listings. She sees the name she's looking for, LYNN WISEMAN.

     Just then, LYNN, the woman from the photos, opens the door
     and walks past. Caught off guard, Norah follows her.

64   FOLLOWING THROUGH STREETS                                          64

     They walk several blocks, Norah keeping a safe distance
     behind Lynn.


65   EXT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY                     65

     Lynn opens the door to the building and disappears inside.
     Norah follows.


66   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - DAY                     66

     Lynn steps into an elevator. Norah does too.


67   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES BUILDING - ELEVATOR - DAY          67

     The doors close. Lynn slaps the `stop elevator' button.
     Norah emits a small yelp.

                         LYNN
               Who are you?

                         NORAH
               What?

                         LYNN
               Why are you following me?

                         NORAH
               I'm not following you.

                         LYNN
               You are following me!

     Lynn freezes for a moment. It seems she isn't even breathing.
     Her anger twists into fear.

                         LYNN
               Aren't you?

     Norah remains silent. Lynn paces back and forth.

                         LYNN
               Oh no.

                         NORAH
               What?

                            LYNN
                  Shit! This is not happening.

     Norah is uncomfortable. Lynn spins around to face Norah.

                            LYNN
                  Listen, I'm sorry. I thought... I
                  thought you were following me.

                            NORAH
                  That's all right.

     Lynn steps closer.

                            LYNN
                  You think I'm crazy.

                            NORAH
                  No. No I don't.

                            LYNN
                  I'm not crazy.

                            NORAH
                  It was a mistake. No big deal.

     Lynn smiles. Norah releases the stop button. Nothing happens.

                            LYNN
                  It's not moving.

                            NORAH
                  Let's press the alarm button.

     Lynn shrugs. Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud
     quick ring. They wait for something to happen.

     An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another
     quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the
     ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises.

     Norah takes out her sign language book. She steals a quick
     sideways look at Lynn before settling on the series of small,
     illustrated hands before her.

                            LYNN
                  Go to the university?

                            NORAH
                  Me? No.

     Lynn leans close and checks out the book.

                            NORAH
               Hobby...

     Lynn sizes Norah up.

                         NORAH
               There's this gorilla who knows sign
               language and I've always thought
               that would have to be the most
               amazing thing ever. You know? To
               actually talk to a gorilla.

                         LYNN
               I think I've seen something on--

     Norah nods.

                            NORAH
               KoKo.

                         LYNN
               Yeah, yeah, with the kitten.

     Norah offers a sad nod.

                         NORAH
               Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's
               fault. She was heartbroken.

     A KNOCKING sound reverberates through the elevator.

                         LYNN
               Kind of weird, don't you think?
               Teaching a gorilla to talk.
               Probably, gorillas aren't supposed
               to talk.

                         NORAH
               That's what's so cool about it.

     Lynn takes a long bold look at Norah. Norah sweats. The
     elevator moves.

                         LYNN
               I'm sorry again about the...

                           NORAH
               No, don't... it's fine.

     Lynn lightly touches the crook of Norah's arm.

                         LYNN
               You've got nice veins.

     Norah smiles self consciously. She's flustered. Not a
     familiar sensation. The doors open to the "Albuquerque Blood
     Services."

                         LYNN
               You should give blood.

     Lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a
     rack. She glances back with a smile just as the doors close.


68   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NIGHT                                         68

     The house is dark except for a TV in the living room and a
     light in Norah's bedroom window.


69   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       69

     Norah pulls the photos from her bag and sets them on a shelf
     next to the candy heart. Then, she drops to the floor and
     pulls the LUNCH BOX from under her bed.

     She surveys the contents: lipstick tipped cigarette butts, an
     eyelash curler, a Blue Jay feather, an old photo.

     In the photo two girls, twelve and five, stand with their
     mom. A cigarette dangles from the mother's ruby red mouth.

     This time Rose's Sentra sits alone. No blue Camry in sight.


71   INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                              71

     Rose lies in bed and listens to cars go by on the highway.
     She checks her watch, picks up the phone and dials.

                         ROSE
               Hi. Could you tell me what time you
               have? Okay. Thanks.

     Rose hangs up and falls back onto the bed, feet dangling off
     the edge. She stares at the ceiling and whispers.

      Joe clears the dinner table while Oscar occupies himself with
      markers, construction paper, and a creative impulse.

      Rose walks in defeated.

                             JOE
                   You're back early.

                             ROSE
                   I'm quitting real estate.

                             JOE
                   What are you talking about? You
                   can't quit real estate. You're
                   gonna be great at real estate. You
                   got the whole look and besides,
                   that's where everything's headed.
                   Hell, it's what I should have done
                   forty years ago.

                              ROSE
                   Shut up.

      Rose sits at the table next to Oscar. She looks miserable.
      Oscar looks at his mom.

                             OSCAR
                   Want me to make you something
                   happy?

      Rose can't help but smile.

                             ROSE
                   Yeah. I'd like that.

                             JOE

     Oscar stares at Winston's empty sleeve.

                            WINSTON
                  That's a nice job you did there.

                            ROSE
                  I was thinking maybe I could set a
                  few out by the register?

                               WINSTON
                  Yeah sure.

     Rose hands Winston a stack of cards. He places them in an owl
     business card holder in front of several Clean Sweep business
     cards.

                            WINSTON
                  This is great but you guys should
                  really get out there and market
                  yourselves.

     Oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns
     it on. Winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should
     turn it off. He does.

                               ROSE

                  So, marketing? Like...?

                            WINSTON
                  Funeral Homes, property managers...
                  What you really want is to get in
                  with the insurance companies. They
                  can throw you a ton of work.

     Oscar walks into the back room.

75   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - DAY                                      75

     Winston puffs up a bit with `manly know how'.

                            WINSTON
                  Do you guys have your B.B.P.

     Winston smiles.

                            WINSTON
                  Blood Born Pathogens. The big money
                  jobs... they'll expect you to be

76   EXT. LAWSON'S USED CAR LOT - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY                     76

     Rose, Norah, Oscar and Joe follow SHERM LAWSON across the car
     lot. Rose shoots an irritated look to her dad.

                            ROSE
                      (whispering to Norah)
                  Did you ask him to come.

                            NORAH
                  Not exactly.

     Joe positions himself next to Rose.

                            JOE
                      (Quietly to Rose)
                  Now Sherm's gonna say he's against
                  the wall but don't you believe him.
                  There's always some wiggle room.

                            ROSE
                  I can handle it.

     The troop comes to a stop in front of a large blue van.

                             SHERM
                  I think you're gonna like this
                  Econoline.

     Sherm opens the back doors. Rose, Joe and Sherm stick their
     heads inside. Rose nods.

                            JOE

                            SHERM
                  Sounds kinda gory.

               Can be. Can be.

     Rose surveys the interior space.

                         ROSE
               We gotta take any contaminated
               materials to the incinerators. So
               we'll need lots of space back here.

                         OSCAR
               For the bloody stuff.

                         ROSE
               So, how much is this?

                         SHERM
               Nineteen Ninety-nine.

                         JOE
               What's the play on that?

                         SHERM
               Oh, that's the floor right there.
               I'm actually taking a loss on this
               to make room for some new product.

                         ROSE
               Well, I could pay cash.

                         SHERM
               Cash is good.

     Sherm walks around and unlocks the driver's side door.

                         JOE
                   (whispering to Rose)
               Ask him about the bumper.

                         ROSE
               What?

                         JOE
               The dented bumper.

     Rose approaches Sherm with a smile.

                          ROSE
               I noticed the bumper's kind of
               banged up.

     Sherm smiles.

                 We were over at Motor Mart on Lomas
                 earlier. They got a nice looking
                 Chevy G series for eighteen.

                           SHERM
                 Power steering?

     Joe nods.

     Oscar crawls into the passenger seat for a closer look. He
     sees the CB mounted on the ceiling and tugs Norah's sleeve.

                           OSCAR
                 What's that?

                           NORAH
                 Oh, excellent.

                           ROSE
                 God, do people even use those
                 anymore?

                           OSCAR
                 What is it?

     Sherm grabs the handset to demonstrate.

                           SHERM
                 It's a CB. You talk into this thing
                 and hold this thing down and it
                 turns your voice into radio waves
                 and sends it into the heavens.

                              OSCAR
                 Heaven?

     Sherm tosses the keys to Rose.

     Rose, Norah and Oscar pile into the van. Joe hangs back with
     Sherm.

     Rose drives. Norah sits shotgun and sings the baseline to a
     70s era porno. Oscar kneels between them staring at the CB.

                         NORAH
               Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive?

                         ROSE
               No.

                         OSCAR
               Try the CB!

     Rose reaches up and clicks the CB on. Nothing but static. She
     adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest
     hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static.

     Oscar's face lights up with amazement. Rose is under-whelmed.
     She clicks the CB off.

                         ROSE
               Antenna's probably broke.

     Norah points out the window.

                         NORAH
               Ice Cream Hut!


79   EXT. ICE CREAM HUT - DAY                                             79

     Rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the
     picnic table where Norah and Oscar wait.

     Norah points to an `apartment for rent' sign on the building
     across the street. A big bosomed woman sits on the porch with
     a rabbit in her lap.

                         NORAH
               How cool to live across from the
               Ice Cream Hut.

     Rose distributes the melty goods.

                         ROSE
               You should rent it. Seriously,
               you're making money now.

     Norah assesses the building. The RABBIT LADY sees them
     staring. She waves. Rose and Norah turn around amused.

                  Yeah well, what about Dad?

                  Oh please, Dad would survive just
                  fine. You should do it.

     As Norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of
     chocolate ice cream drip down Oscar's cone, over his hand and
     on to Norah's leg.

                            NORAH
                  Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure
                  the perimeter.
                      (To Rose)
                  Don't you teach this kid anything?

     Norah demonstrates proper technique. She extends her tongue
     out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob, then twirls the
     cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate.

                            LYNN (O.S.)
                  It's the gorilla girl.

     Norah looks up to see Lynn with a milk shake in hand. An
     involuntary smile breaks across Norah.

                            LYNN
                  You never came to donate.

                               NORAH

     Lynn looks at Rose. An awkward moment passes.

                               NORAH
                  My sister.

     Rose smiles, nods a hi. Something familiar about the girl
     nags at Rose. She searches to connect a face out of context.

     Lynn eyes Norah. Chemistry.

                            LYNN
                  We have snacks you know. Juice

     Rose makes the connection - her smile drops. Lynn picks up on
     the tension between the two.

                         LYNN
               Okay. Well, see you around.

     Lynn leaves. Rose slaps Norah with an accusing look.

                         SHERM
               Crappy zippers. Wasn't that it?

     Sherm smiles. Joe's smile disappears.

               Yeah, that's been a while now.
               Dropped the luggage around the time
               your other lot when out of
               business.

     Touche. Sherm's smile dissolves.

                         SHERM
               I could maybe drop it to nineteen
               even.

     Joe holds out for more.

     Rose sits on a folding chair and takes notes. The thirty or
     so people listening to the SPEAKER appear to be mostly
     hospital staff and EMT workers. A placard near the door
     reads: SEMINAR FOR BLOOD BORNE PATHOGENS.

     CARL SWANSON leans forward from his chair and looks down the

     Flustered, Rose brushes crumbs off her face and inadvertently
     deposits a blob of mustard on her cheek. They shake hands.

                  Rose Lorkowski. Nice to meet you.

                  I hear you're my new competition.

                            ROSE
                  We're hardly competition for you.

                            CARL
                      (smiles)
                  I'm glad to see you're doing a
                  little homework. A lot of people,
                  you know, they think they can just
                  jump in to this, make lots of
                  money. But, they don't know what
                  they're doing. No idea. They're not
                  professional and that makes us all
                  look bad.

                            ROSE
                  Well, we're not like that. I just
                  have to complete this seminar and
                  we're certified.

                            CARL
                  You're not certified?

                            ROSE
                  Not yet. Probably by the end of the
                  month.

     Carl smiles, dips a napkin in his cup of water and wipes the
     smudge of mustard from Rose's cheek.

                            CARL
                  You had a...

     Attendees file back to their chairs.

                            ROSE
                  I think it's starting.

                            CARL
                  Sure I can't buy you a drink?

     Rose and Carl sit at the bar nursing drinks.

                            CARL
                  If you spray the enzyme at that
                  point it'll just turn back to
                  liquid which is a pain in the ass.
                  The key is to bag it when it's kind
                  of Jell-o-ee.

                            ROSE
                  That makes total sense. Why didn't
                  I think of that?

                            CARL
                  You just figure all this shit out
                  as you go. Experience.

     Rose chews on her cocktail straw.

                            ROSE
                  It's not how I thought it'd be. I
                  thought it'd be gross.

     Rose stops. Reflects. Turns to Carl.

                            ROSE
                  Sometimes it's gross. The maggots
                  are gross. The maggots kind of
                  freak me.

                            CARL
                  Yeah.

                            ROSE
                  The sound. The munching sound.

                            CARL
                  And it's so hard to kill the little
                  fuckers.

                            ROSE
                  Tell me about it. You pour
                  industrial bleach right on
                  `em...nothing.

     Carl offers a knowing nod.

                            CARL
                  Just roll their eyes and call you a
                  pussy.

     Rose laughs and takes another sip of her drink.

     The door to the bathroom is open. Carl hums a happy tune in
     the shower.

     Rose shimmies back into her clothes with an expression of
     self-loathing.

88   INT. VAN - THREE DAYS LATER - DAY                                      88

     Rose drives and Norah holds a long list of funeral homes and
     other establishments. They're all crossed off. Oscar sits
     bored in the back.

                            OSCAR
                  What's a bastard?

     Rose looks at Norah with concern.

                            OSCAR
                  Jeremy said I was a bastard. What
                  does that mean?

     Rose has no idea how to respond. Norah turns to face Oscar.

                            NORAH
                  It just means your mom wasn't
                  married when she had you. It's no
                  big deal. In a couple of years
                  you're gonna find it's a free pass
                  to cool. You'll probably start a
                  band called Bastard Son. Use it to
                  impress the chicks. Trust me, the
                  whole bastard thing... it's working
                  for you.

     Oscar looks to Rose and then back to Norah.

     Rose's phone rings. She answers it, relieved for the
     distraction

                            ROSE
                  Hello, Sunshine Cleaning... Well,
                  I'm glad you liked the Fancy
                  Corn....Okay, yeah, yeah.

     Rose grabs a pen, hands it to Norah and motions for her to
     write something down.

                            ROSE
                  Okay... 2327 Grove Avenue. Got
                  it... Sure. Yeah. Thank you.

     Rose hangs up.

                            NORAH
                  What was that?

                               ROSE
                  A suicide!


89   EXT. BRICK RANCHER - DAY                                               89

     Rose pulls the van up to the house and sees the old lady
     sitting out front. MRS. DAVIS.

                               ROSE
                  Oh, man.

     Rose and Norah exchange a look and then Rose turns to Oscar.

                            ROSE
                  OK. Stay in the van. You want a
                  soda or anything?

     Oscar shakes his head.

                            ROSE
                  We won't be long.

     As Rose and Norah get out and unload supplies the old lady
     stands to greet them. She's dressed up in the way old ladies
     are when they expect company.

                            ROSE
                  Mrs. Davis?

     The woman nods. She is dazed with grief.

                            ROSE
                  We're the cleaning service.

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Yes, yes. I... I wanted to give you
                  the keys.

     The old woman holds out a shaky hand. Rose gently takes the
     keys. Norah hangs back.

                              MRS. DAVIS
                  In the sunroom. That's where my
                  husband... I had bridge and...

     She blinks twice, slowly, then snaps back.

                  Do you need me to show you?

                            ROSE
                  No, no. I think we can find it.

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Oh. Okay. That's good then.

     Rose and Norah gather their things and head up the stairs.

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  My son-in-law's coming to take me
                  to lunch at the Howard Johnson's.
                  They have such nice rolls there.

     Rose hands Norah the key and motions for her to go ahead.

                            ROSE
                  Would you like to sit for a moment,
                  Mrs. Davis?

                            MRS. DAVIS
                  Yes dear, I think I would.

     Rose sits down on the steps with Mrs. Davis and Norah quietly
     enters the house.

     From the van Oscar watches Rose and the old woman sit side by
     side on the front step. Rose's hand rests lightly on the
     woman's bony shoulder. Words seem useless.


90   INT. BRICK RANCHER - LIVING ROOM - DAY                               90

     Norah looks around the room furnished modestly with a mixture
     of antiques and things that are simply old.

     Yellow sticky notes cling to doors, walls, light switches,
     etc. Each note contains a simple instruction such as `turn
     off light' or `watch news at 6:00'.

     Norah walks past family photos that line the hall.


91   INT. BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - DAY                                   91

     Norah enters the red splattered room. A walker lies on its
     side next to a blood-soaked rug. Golden sunlight pours
     through the windows.

     A yellow square sticks to a picture frame on the coffee
     table. The frame holds the image of a smiling young couple in
     a different era. The note reads `Edna plays bridge at 4:00'.

     Norah slips a Tyvec jumper on and looks out the window. A car
     pull up to the curb. Norah stops and watches her sister walk
     Mrs. Davis to the car before starting her work.


92   INT. BRICK RANCHER - SUNROOM - MOMENTS LATER                            92

     Rose enters quietly, in a fog. The stillness of grief is
     contagious.

                              NORAH
                  She okay?

     Rose nods and picks up the photo of a younger Mr and Mrs
     Davis. She then steps into her Tyvec coveralls and zips up.

     Norah drives. Rose holds Oscar in her lap, arms clasped tight
     around him.

                            OSCAR
                  That lady seemed really sad.

                            ROSE
                  Her husband died.

     Oscar thinks about this a moment.

                            OSCAR
                  So he's in heaven?

     Rose nods.

                            OSCAR
                  Maybe we could let her use our CB
                  and she could talk to him.

     Rose looks confused. Oscar presses on.

                            OSCAR
                  Maybe he would hear her.

     Rose smiles. Doesn't seem like the moment to correct him.

                              ROSE
                  Maybe.

     Oscar and Joe scratch game cards.

                            OSCAR
                  I won a million dollars!

                            JOE
                  Let me see that.

     Oscar hands the ticket over.

                            JOE
                  You gotta get two hydrants with a
                  matching amount. See? None of your
                  fire hydrants match.

     Oscar looks at the Lucky Dog card with defeat.

                            JOE
                  And three zeros is a thousand
                  dollars. You woulda won a thousand
                  dollars but it doesn't match
                  anything.

                            OSCAR
                  What happens if it doesn't match
                  anything?

                            JOE
                  You toss it and try the next one.

     Oscar moves on to his next ticket. He scratches the coating
     away and tentatively lifts his game card

                            OSCAR
                  I think I won five hundred dollars.

     Joe looks at the card. He looks at Oscar and grins.

                            OSCAR
                  I'm gonna buy a trampoline and a
                  karaoke player and some chocolate
                  honey dipped donuts.

                  money.

                            OSCAR
                  I scratched it.

                            JOE
                  Yes you did. You scratched the

     Oscar follows his grampa over to the pay phone.

               And we're not going to spend the
               money. We're going to invest the
               money.

     Joe plunks in some quarters, dials, waits while it rings.

                         JOE
               See, that's the difference between
               a regular person and somebody with

               for you to know. A-cu-men. Means

96   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                                     96

     Rose pays bills at the kitchen table. Oscar bounces a super
     ball.

                         OSCAR
               We're gonna make the money grow
               because that's the smart way. It's
               capital and you don't spend that.
               You invest it. That way you can get
               the SP250 and have money left over.

                         ROSE
               What are you talking about?

     Oscar races out of the kitchen and then races back in with a
     pamphlet showcasing the amazingly sleek SP250 binoculars. He
     hands the pamphlet to Rose.

                         OSCAR
               The binoculars that grampa's gonna
               get me for my birthday.

                         ROSE
               Oh honey, come here.

     Rose pulls out a chair for Oscar. Oscar sits down and crosses
     his arms in front of himself.

                         ROSE
               Sometimes your grampa promises
               things that he really wants to
               happen.

               No, he's really gonna get `em. He's
               got a plan.

                         ROSE
               Okay. If you say so.

     Rose goes back to the bills.


97   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ DAY                                97

     Lynn wears a white coat. Norah sits in one of the reclining
     chairs scattered about the room.

                         NORAH
               You made it seem so fun.

                         LYNN
               Oh it is fun. Would you like a
               refreshment?

     Norah smiles and shakes her head.

                         LYNN
               No?

     Norah watches Lynn's hands push up her sleeve. Lynn rubs
     iodine in expanding circles on the inside of Norah's arm.

     Lynn puts plastic gloves on and ties a tourniquet around
     Norah's arm. She puts a rubber ball in Norah's hand.

                         LYNN
               Can you squeeze that for me?

     Norah squeezes the ball and Lynn touches the plump vein.

                         LYNN
               That's good. One more time.

     Lynn takes the needle and draws it close to Norah's arm.

                            NORAH
                  Oh my God, is that the needle? It's
                  a fucking cocktail straw.

     Norah looks nervous. Lynn smiles reassuringly.

                            LYNN
                  Trust me, I'm very good at this.
                  Squeeze again.

     Norah squeezes, Lynn touches the soft blue stripe of blood
     beneath Norah's skin and slides the needle into the vein.

                            LYNN
                  Wasn't that fun?

                            NORAH
                  You might have oversold it.

     Lynn smiles.

                            LYNN
                  Kind of twirl the ball around in
                  your hand. Good. It doesn't hurt,
                  does it?

                             NORAH
                      (shakes her head)
                  Feels hot.

                            LYNN
                  That's a good sign.

     Norah self-consciously nods and smiles. Lynn turns and
     jostles the bag of blood.

                            NORAH
                  My friend's having a thing tonight.

     Lynn switches her attention from the blood back to Norah.

                            NORAH
                  Never mind.

99   INT. PARTY HOUSE ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                              99

     Norah and Lynn sit on a ratty couch in a crowded smoke filled
     room. Next to them, a flannel wearing burn-out rocks to
     headphones. Norah wears a candy necklace. Debauchery plays
     out around them.

                         NORAH
               I knew you wouldn't have any fun
               here.

                         LYNN
               I am having fun.

     Norah takes a tug on the joint and passes it to Lynn.

                            LYNN
               No thanks.

                         NORAH
               Lambs breath.

                         LYNN
               Yeah, no thanks.

               Just kind of superstitious.

     Norah nods and passes the joint across Lynn to the burn-out.
     The burn-out tugs and passes it back to Lynn. Lynn waves it
     off a second time.

                  I'm not Mormon. I just... You're
                  gonna think it's weird.

                            NORAH

                            LYNN
                  Sometimes I think that when you get
                  high or drink or alter your
                  consciousness like that--

                  I think it weakens you psychically...
                  like it creates these cracks and
                  then bad things can seep in and
                  maybe never go away.

     Norah stares at Lynn with great blood-shot concentration.

                  All right, you're kind of freakin

                  You should just tell people you're
                  Mormon.

     Two women gnaw at Randy's neck. His necklace is almost empty.

                  Yes. Yes, he is.

     Lynn lightly tugs on Norah's candy necklace. She leans in
     close and takes a bite of the candy. Norah catches her
     breath. Paralyzed.

     Lynn smiles, pleased by Norah's reaction.

      Norah and Randy lie on a thread bare couch. Their bodies rock
      to the motion of sex. Norah's thoughts are elsewhere.

      A small TV sits next to Norah's growing collection of found
      trinkets. It spills blue light into the smoke tinged air.

      On the TV, a REPORTER stands outside Quicky Lube. Norah turns

                   We are.

                             ROSE
                   We're in the process.

                             NORAH
                   You went to that thing.

                   Wait. I thought you went to that
                   thing.

      Rose scans the area.

                             ROSE
                   Are you guys all finished?

                             OFFICER
                   It's all yours.

      Rose and Norah slip into their Tyvecs.

                             ROSE
                   Why don't you grab the wet-vac and
                   I'll start bagging the loose stuff.

      The officer walks past Mac who continues to stare at Rose.
      She looks beautiful and strong.

105   EXT. QUICKY LUBE PARKING LOT - NIGHT                              105

      Rose and Norah pull supplies from the van and ready
      themselves for the Quicky Lube job.

                          NORAH
                I thought you went to the thing.

                          ROSE
                I did. I mean, I went to part of
                it. Most of it.

                          NORAH
                What do you mean you went to part
                of it? It was a one day thing.

                          ROSE
                I got side tracked.

                          NORAH
                Side tracked?

                          ROSE
                That Above and Beyond guy was
                there. Carl. We got talking shop
                and--

                          NORAH
                Oh my God, you humped Carl!

      Rose can't deny it. Norah shakes her head.

                          ROSE
                I'm already registered for the next
                one.

                          NORAH
                That's disgusting.


106   EXT. DESERT ROAD - TWO DAYS LATER - DAY                           106

      Joe and Oscar sit in the car pulled off to the side of a
      lonely highway intersection.

                          JOE
                You got twenty bucks and you want
                three pizza's. They cost five
                dollars each and you have a coupon
                for two dollars off.

                             JOE (cont'd)
                   You figure you'll tip the delivery
                   guy a couple bucks but the
                   delivery guy turns out to be a
                   lady. Real sizzler. So you give her
                   a crisp five. How much do you have
                   left?

      Oscar thinks.

      Joe assumes there's no way the kid's getting this and turns
      his attention outside. A truck appear on the horizon.

                             OSCAR
                   Two dollars?

                             JOE
                   Hey, how'd you come up with that?

                             OSCAR
                   Math.

      The truck slows down as it reaches the intersection, pulls
      off the road, and stops. Joe gets out and walks over.

      Oscar watches the trucker hop down from the cab and shake
      Joe's hand like they're old friends.

                                                              CUT TO

      The trunk of the Monte Carlo brims with shrimp and ice. Joe
      slams it closed, climbs in the car and gives Oscar a wink.


107   EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY                                                107

108   INT. JOE'S CAR - DAY                                              108

      Joe beams with excitement.

                             JOE
                   The thing is Oscar...and this is
                   important to learn early...life is
                   sales. Buying and selling. It's the
                   core of social interaction. And
                   human beings are social beings.

      Smoke starts to seep out from under the hood. Joe eyes the
      temperature gauge.

      Norah loads equipment into the van, gets in and waits for
      Rose to finish the transaction.

      A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN opens the door. She's angry.

                   I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother
                   you. I just wanted to let you know
                   that we're all finished up and--

      The woman glares at Rose.

                             MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                   Oh, you want to get paid.

                             ROSE
                   We can come back later if that's
                   better.

      The woman shakes her head and holds out a check.

                             MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                   I can't believe I have to deal with
                   this now. My son just died for
                   Christ's sake.

      The woman looks away.

                             ROSE
                   I'm so sorry for your loss.

      Rose starts to leave.

                                MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                   Thank you.

      Rose stops. Turns

                             MIDDLE AGED WOMAN
                   For what you did. Thank you.

      Rose nods and continues on to the van.

      They ride down an Albuquerque street in silence.

                             ROSE
                   You want a Coke?

111   INT. GAS STATION FOODMART - DAY                                  111

      Rose fills a cup at the soda fountain. Through the window she
      sees Mac and family pull up on the other side of the store.

      Mac gets out and pumps gas. The woman, HEATHER, laughs with
      the little girl in the back seat. They look happy.

      Rose's fountain drink overflows.

                          ROSE
                Dammit.

      Rose grabs for a napkin which clumps and tears.

      The door BEEPS. Rose jumps behind the candy rack and peeks
      around. All clear. She turns and smacks into Heather. Heather
      glares at Rose.

                          HEATHER
                You think I don't know?

      Heather trembles with anger. Rose stands frozen.

                          HEATHER
                You may have been hot shit in high
                school but what are you now?
                Nothing. A waste of space.

      Heather reaches out and gives Rose a little push. Ten years
      of anger culminating in this one anti climactic gesture.

      Rose watches Heather walk away and knows every word is true.


112   EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY                                           112

      A stream of water leaks from the trunk. Joe gets out cursing
      under his breath. He kicks the car and a hub cap falls off.
      It's an unbearable insult.

                          JOE
                Stupid shit heap!

      Fifty years of failures result in an explosion of
      frustration. Joe stomps on the hub cap, picks it up and
      throws it as far as he can.

      Joe gathers himself and leans in the window. He forces a
      smile at Oscar. Oscar looks nervous.

                   It's alright. Everything's okay.

      Joe opens the trunk and checks on the shrimp. A car zooms by.
      Joe tries to wave it down. No good. Another zooms by.

                             JOE
                   Come on, come on, come on, come on.

      Joe struggles to wave down a car. No luck. Joe has an idea.

                             JOE
                   Make like you're crying.

      Oscar turns on the tears. A car stops.


113   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING                         113

      Rose walks in. Oscar and Joe feign casualness.

      Joe looks at the bathroom door which stands open. Inside the
      tub brims with shrimp and ice.

                             ROSE
                   What did you guys do today?

                              OSCAR
                   Nothing.

      Rose turns to Joe who shrugs.

                   How's it without Norah here?

                              JOE

      Joe walks over and casually shuts the bathroom door.

                   weren't around and...

      Norah shakes her head. Randy doesn't know what to say.

                             NORAH
                   Listen, Randy I think we should
                   stop hanging out.

                   You're breaking up with me over the

                   I don't know, the way you act, I
                   didn't even think that you'd care
                   that much.

                   Yeah, I don't. I should, but I
                   don't. And you're a really great
                   guy. But...I don't care if you have
                   sex with the rabbit lady... and I
                   mean, it seems like I should care
                   about that.

      Rose opens a stack of neglected mail. She is interrupted by a
      light knock on the door. Rose peeks out the peep hole.

                             ROSE
                   Shit.

      Rose hesitates, then opens the door just a crack.

116   EXT. LYNN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                              116

      Norah stands disheveled, six pack in hand. Lynn opens the
      door wearing slippers.

                             NORAH
                   Ever been trestling?


117   EXT NOB HILL RESTAURANT ROW - NIGHT                                 117

      Shrimp jiggles in Joe's hand cart as he makes his way toward
      the row of upscale restaurants.

       A couple of upscale hipsters stare curiously at the hand cart
       as they pass Joe.


118    INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                       118

       Sounds of sex seep through thin walls. Oscar sits up in bed.

       After a moment he crawls out of bed, he grabs a flashlight
       from his shelf and exits his room.


118A   INT. ROSE'S APARTMENT - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                    118A

       The mattress squeaks slightly as Mac and Rose have sex.


119    EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         119

       In pajamas and bare feet, Oscar steps into the night. He
       flicks on the flashlight.

       Norah leads Lynn through a wooded area toward a train
       trestle. Norah carries the two remaining beers of a six pack.

                              LYNN
                    Are the bodies there?

                              NORAH
                    No. The person is gone. It's weird
                    `cuz we're connected to them in
                    this strangely intimate way... but
                    we never actually meet them. It's
                    just kind of weird.

       Norah steps over a discarded tire.

                              NORAH
                    I have seen a dead body once
                    though.

                              LYNN
                    Yeah?

                              NORAH
                    My mom.

       Lynn follows Norah, not knowing how to respond. It's awkward.
       Norah tries to lighten things.

      Norah nods.

                             NORAH
                   A bunch of Hollywood people were
                   filming down in Old Town. They
                   thought my mom was so beautiful and
                   so talented that they gave her a
                   speaking part. You want to hear it?

      Lynn nods.

                             NORAH
                   `I recommend the pecan pie.'

      Norah looks back at Lynn for applause.

                             LYNN
                   I recommend the pecan pie?

      Norah nods.

                             NORAH
                   That was her line. It was on TV and
                   everything.

                             LYNN
                   That's pretty cool.

                             NORAH
                   Me and Rose, we didn't actually see
                   it but Rose says mom talked about
                   it all the time. I don't remember.

      Norah shrugs.

                             NORAH
                   I don't remember her much at all. I
                   have this box of her stuff though,
                   little things she touched. When it
                   seems like she never even really
                   existed... it's proof.

      The two reach the bottom of a train trestle.

                             NORAH
                   All right. This is where we climb.

                               LYNN
                   What?

                          NORAH
                Up to that girder.

      Norah points to a rusted girder about eight feet from the
      underbelly of the track.

                          LYNN
                I'm not climbing up there.

                          NORAH
                Best place to be when it comes.

                          LYNN
                Uh-uh.

      Norah slips her hand through one of the plastic rings of the
      six pack and starts to climb.

                          NORAH
                You're gonna miss the best part.

                          LYNN
                I accept that.

      The two cans of beer dangle from Norah's arm like a giant
      charm bracelet and clank against girders as she climbs.

                            NORAH
                It's like... it's like this big
                pissed off God up in your face just
                screaming at you. So close you can
                smell the metal on his breath.

                          LYNN
                Sounds great.

                          NORAH
                It is. I'm telling you.

      Norah wedges her butt into the belly of a beam and taps her
      fingers against the rusted girder. After a moment she leans
      out and looks down toward Lynn.

                          NORAH
                I didn't mean to bum you out with
                the whole mom stuff. I just thought
                you would... I don't know, I guess
                I thought...

                          LYNN
                What?

      The trestle starts to shake.

                          NORAH
                He's coming.

      The thunder gets louder. Lynn covers her ears. Norah pops
      open a beer and laughs as the train approaches.


121   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                         121

      Oscar walks along the sidewalk alone. He stops at the van,
      opens the door and gets in.

      He looks very small in the driver's seat. He lifts the
      handset to the CB.


      INTERCUT DIALOGUE WITH FOLLOWING SEQUENCE

                          OSCAR
                What was I before I was born? What
                happens when we die? Do animals go
                to the same place as we go after we
                die? Is heaven really crowded? When
                somebody gets an arm chopped off
                does it go to heaven? Is Jesus
                another name for you or are you two
                separate people? Were you born?
                Will you die? If you already live
                in heaven where do you go when you
                die?


122   EXT. TRAIN TRESTLE - NIGHT                                        122

      The train careens above Norah. Sparks fly from the blur of
      wheels. The sky flashes between each of the cars. Stars and
      grease and metal and night collide. Norah closes her eyes.

      The sound of the train merges with the loud static of a CB.


123   EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - FRONT YARD - 1987 - DAY                    123

      The sky is an electric blue. The kind that lives in memories
      and dreams. Rose (10) and Norah (5) play in a parked car.

      Rose pretends to drive and smoke a cigarette while Norah
      makes faces in the rearview mirror.

      Rose gets out of the car and races toward the house. Norah
      chases after.

                             NORAH
                   Rose, wait for me.

124   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - 1987 - DAY                  124

      A giggling Rose stumbles in. She stops. The bathroom door is
      open slightly. She walks over peeks through the opening.

      There's a dress crumpled on the floor. A woman slumps
      motionless in the tub. Her delicate hand hangs over the edge.
      Scarlet fingerprints mar the white porcelain.

      Norah enters the front door. She smiles, unburdened by the
      knowledge. She runs towards Rose. Rose quickly pushes her
      back and closes the door.

      Norah senses something's wrong. She struggles to see what's
      behind the door but Rose won't let go.


125   EXT. TRAIN TRESTLE - NIGHT                                       125

      The static mixes back into the roar of the train. The roar
      grows distant and is replaced by Norah's laughter.

      Still laughing, Norah takes a sip of her beer and sets it on
      a beam next to her. The beer falls. Norah tries to catch it,
      loses her balance and falls with a thud.

      Lynn catches her breath.

                             LYNN
                Oh, shit.

      Lynn runs over to find Norah on her back, eyes closed. Norah
      opens her eyes and laughs.

                             LYNN
                You idiot.

      Norah grabs the beer that she had been chasing. There's not
      much left but she downs the remainder.

                          NORAH
                Sneaky fucker.

                   I think I broke my hand.

                             LYNN
                   Really?

      Lynn leans close with real concern.

                             NORAH
                   No. But it hurts like a mother.

      Lynn pops the top on the remaining beer and takes a huge gulp
      before handing it to Norah.


126   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT                              126

      Oscar walks down the sidewalk alone. His flashlight provides
      small circle of light on the cement in front of him.

      Rose stands in her T-shirt and undies. Mac shuts the door.
      Rose leans her head against the door and exhales deeply. She
      turns as if something is calling her.


128   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               128

      Rose stands on tip toes and feels around on top of the

      emergency cigarettes.


129   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                           129

      Rose sits down on the couch and lights her cigarette. The
      nicotine patch is still clearly visible on her arm.

      Rose looks at the stack of unopened mail. Something grabs her
      attention. An envelope bearing the return address of Paula
      Datzman-Mead. Rose rips opens the envelope.

      Rose stares at an invitation to Paula's baby shower. A smile
      creeps across her face.

      The front door opens and Oscar walks in.

      Brow furrowed, he walks past Rose without acknowledging her.
      He goes straight to his room and shuts the door.


130   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT ­ LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                       130

      A bottle of wine sits empty on a box next to two nearly empty
      Styrofoam cups.

                             LYNN
                   How's the hand?

      Norah shakes the last few drops from her cup and starts
      gnawing on the side. Lynn takes Norah's hand and examines it.

                              NORAH
                   Ow!

                              LYNN
                   Sorry.

      Lynn draws Norah's hand close to her lips. Smiles. Looks at
      Norah. Norah's a deer in headlights. Lynn kisses Norah's
      hand. Everything is still and tense.

                              LYNN
                   Better?

      Norah   stares at her recently kissed hand and nods. She looks
      up to   Lynn. Lynn kisses Norah lightly on the lips. A tester
      kiss.   Then again. Softly. Norah doesn't move, eyes locked on
      Lynn.   All is good.

      Norah leans in and kisses Lynn's neck. Lynn's eyes are closed
      enjoying the moment.

      Lynn opens her eyes. The school photos of Lynn sit directly
      across from her on the shelf. Lynn stares at the pictures.
      Waves of recognition and confusion register in her eyes.

      Norah kisses Lynn's neck oblivious.

                              LYNN
                   Is that?

      Lynn pulls away.

                   tell you.

      Lynn shakes her head disbelieving.

                             LYNN
                   Where would you find old pictures
                   of me?

                              NORAH
                   At work.

                              LYNN
                   What?

                             NORAH
                   We did this job a while back. This
                   woman...

      Lynn scans the other trinkets arranged neatly on the shelf.
      Her eyes focus on the photo ID. Her mother. Her face goes
      completely blank. Shock.

                              LYNN
                   My mom.

      Norah bites her lip and nods.

                             LYNN
                   My mom is dead.

      A hazy mix of shame, sadness and guilt seeps into the void.

                             NORAH
                   I wanted to tell you... that first
                   day. That's why I--

                             LYNN
                   You knew this whole time?

                             NORAH
                   I think... You know, I think
                   there's a reason that I found them.
                   The pictures. Because that lead me
                   to you, right?

                And I don't know exactly what went
                on between you and your mom... what
                the situation was... but it just
                seems like... You know, of anybody,
                I would understand.

      Lynn's hazy emotional mix has hardened into something sharp.
      Anger. She looks at Norah with disgust.

                          LYNN
                You would understand?

      Lynn turns to leave.

                          NORAH
                Wait. Please. Don't...I--

      Lynn opens the door. Norah reaches out but Lynn stops her
      with an icy look.

                          LYNN
                You're sick, you know that? There's
                something wrong with you.

      Lynn shuts the door and it feels like a slap.

      Norah sinks down onto the couch. Just Norah now. The
      emptiness crowds around her.


131   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - ONE WEEK LATER - DAY                          131

      The afternoon sun beats against the weathered paint.


132   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE -    BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                        132

      The baby shower invitation looms large on the makeup table.

      Rose wears a slip and unusually big hair. She grabs several
      outfits from her closet. Oscar watches.

                          ROSE
                The blue or the flowery?

                             OSCAR
                The blue.

                             ROSE
                Good call.

      Rose slips on the dress and sits to apply mascara. Oscar
      shuffles out of the bedroom.

      Rose's cell phone rings. She picks up the phone while
      applying lipstick.

                             ROSE

                   We've got a house we need to turn
                   around and our regular guys are
                   busy in Santa Fe today. Thought I'd
                   give you all a call.

      Rose knocks over a bottle of nail polish remover as she grabs
      a pen and writes down the info.

                             ROSE
                   Great. No problem.

      Rose hangs up.

                             ROSE
                   Shit, shit, shit.

      Rose pulls on some panty hose and wrestles with her shoes.

                             ROSE
                   Honey, call grampa.

      Oscar dials.

                                OSCAR
                   It's busy.

       Rose grabs her purse. Rose and Oscar rush out. A baby shower
       gift sits forgotten by the door.


133    INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                     133

       Norah cradles a phone to her ear and shoves clothes from a
       box into an old dresser.

                           NORAH
                 Blow off the shower.


133A   INT. VAN - AFTERNOON                                             133A

       Rose drives the van and talks on her cell phone. Oscar looks
       tiny in the passenger seat.

                             ROSE
                 I can't I... I RSVPed.

                 So tell him we can't do it.

                            ROSE
                 It's an insurance company. They
                 could throw us a ton of work. This
                 is our in.

                           NORAH
                 So, don't go to the damn baby
                 shower. It's not like you ever even
                 liked Paula.

                           ROSE
                 I promise I'll come straight after
                 the shower and help finish up.


134    EXT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - DAY                                       134

       Rose and Oscar walk up to the house. Rose tries the door but
       it's locked. She knocks. No answer. An uneasy tension shoots
       through her.

       She fumbles for her keys to unlock the door and is hit with a
       horrible familiar smell. Oscar pinches his nose.

      Angry, Oscar sits down on the steps.


135   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                          135

      The phone next to Joe's Lazy Boy is off the hook.

                          ROSE
                Dad!

      Rose walks briskly through the house. Urgency mounts with
      each step.

                          ROSE
                Dad! Daddy!

      Rose throws the bathroom door open in a panic.


136   INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY                             136

      Joe scoops rotten shrimp from the bathtub with an empty fancy
      corn canister and dumps them into a garbage can.

      Rose recoils at the intense smell.

                          JOE
                I'm busy here.

      He tries to swing the door shut but Rose stops it. Steps in.

                          ROSE
                Damn it dad, you scared me.

      Sweat drips down Joe's face. He continues his labor and
      avoids looking at Rose.

                          JOE
                Those snotty restaurant fucks
                wouldn't buy my shrimp. Some
                bullshit about health codes or
                whatever. I don't believe that shit
                for a second.

                          ROSE
                God, dad what were you--

      He holds up a finger.

                   Bastards completely shut me out.
                   They got their own little cartel.
                   Little restaurant mafia. I bet they
                   screwed with my car too. I wouldn't

                   mother fuckers.

      Rose leans against the door and watches her father. A wet
      slap punctuates each new deposit into the garbage.

                             ROSE
                   I need you to watch Oscar.

      Another load of slimy shrimp smacks the garbage.

                I was wondering if Oscar could hang
                out here for a little while.

      Winston looks nervous. He looks at Oscar.

                          ROSE
                I've got this baby shower to go to
                and Norah's working a job and my

                I guess not.

                          ROSE
                You're a lifesaver.

                          WINSTON
                You did your hair different.

                          ROSE
                You like it?

      Winston nods.

                          ROSE
                All right. Be good. I'll pick him
                up in a few hours when I'm done.

      Rose leaves. Oscar and Winston are left on their own. Winston
      forces a smile. Oscar does not reciprocate. Winston turns and
      walks to the back room.

      Winston glues a tiny piece to the model plane. Oscar inches
      his way over.

                What's that?

                          WINSTON
                This is a World War Two Mitchell
                Cannon Nose Bomber.

      Oscar leans in closer to examine all the tiny pieces.

                          OSCAR
                You make all these models?

      Winston nods and points to a teeny plastic strut.

                    Dab the end of that in the glue.
                    Just a little bit.

       Oscar carefully dabs the plastic piece in the puddle of glue
       and hands it to Winston.

                              OSCAR
                    What's that piece for?

                              WINSTON
                    It's a strut.

       With delicate precision, Winston attaches the piece.

                              OSCAR
                    What's a strut?

                              WINSTON
                    Supports the wing.

       Oscar examines one of the many completed models.

                              OSCAR
                    Seems like it'd be hard to build
                    models with just one hand.

                              WINSTON
                    It is.

       Norah grabs a bottle of OJ from the fridge, checks the
       expiration and takes a slug. Cat bowls sit in the corner.

      Norah examines a snapshot on the fridge. A chubby middle-aged
      woman surrounded by cats. The woman is bald and smiling.

      Norah spots some incense. She holds a stick to her nose.


143   INT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON                143

      Norah lights the incense stick and sets it on the dresser
      next to a little statue of the laughing Buddha. A collection
      of cat whiskers sits in the Buddha's lap.

      Evidence of death soils the bed. Books crowd the night stand.
      Living with Breast Cancer, Foods That Fight Cancer, and
      Coming to Terms With Death.

144   INT. DATZMAN-MEAD HOUSE - GREAT ROOM - AFTERNOON                   144

      The room titters with wannabe country clubbers. They nibble
      appetizers around a pastel tower of gifts.

      Rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth. She's flanked by Paula
      and a MOUSEY WOMAN in a pink dress and matching pink pumps.

                             MOUSEY
                   So Rose, what are you doing? Are
                   you still cleaning houses?

                             PAULA
                   Rose has gone into real estate.

                             ROSE
                   Actually, I own my own business.

                             MOUSEY
                   A real estate business?

                             ROSE
                   No. It's a biohazard removal and
                   crime scene clean up service. It's
                   a growth niche industry right now ­
                   highly technical and competitive.

                             MOUSEY
                   What does that mean ­ biohazard
                   removal whatever?

                             ROSE
                   A lot of times, when somebody dies,
                   it can be kind of, you know, messy.
                   So, we go in and clean up all that
                   left over mess. Make sure that the
                   area is clean and sanitary.

      Paula and Mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust.

                             ROSE
                   People just don't understand the

                   Course, we have a whole arsenal of
                   disinfectants and um... professional
                   techniques. Like I said, it's a

      Pleased with herself, Rose grabs another cheese puff.

                   Real growth industry.

                             MOUSEY
                   I can't imagine. You like doing it?

                                ROSE
                   Yeah.

      Rose stops. She hadn't thought about whether she liked it.

                             ROSE
                   I do. We come into the lives of
                   people who have just experienced
                   something so sad and profound.
                   They've lost somebody. The
                   circumstances are different but
                   that's the same.

      As Rose talks, her whole demeanor changes. Relaxes. That
      brittle, self conscious edge dissipates.

                             ROSE
                   And we help them. In this one small
                   way... we help.

      Rose is lost in her thoughts. Something profound is shifting.

                             MOUSEY
                   Sounds horrible to me.

                             PAULA

      Norah stuffs bedding in biohazard bags and wraps the mattress
      in plastic sheeting. A fan clanks at the window.

      Norah struggles to get the wrapped mattress though the door.
      It tips and Norah bangs her hand against the door frame.

                                NORAH
                   Shit.

      The incense falls from the dresser. Norah finally muscles the
      mattress through the doorway.


146   EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - AFTERNOON                               146

      Norah drags the mattress to the driveway. A wisp of smoke
      curls from the window behind her.

      As Norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest MEOW
      rise from the bushes. She investigates.

      A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges
      looks up with big startled eyes. Norah smiles.

                             NORAH
                   Oh my God, you're the cutest thing
                   ever. Did you get left behind?

      The kitten answers with a pitiful raspy sound that passes for
      a meow. Norah is powerless to resist.

                                NORAH
                   It's okay.

      As Norah leans down to pick up the kitten, it darts from the
      bushes and heads toward the road.

                             NORAH
                   No, no, no.

      Norah chases the frightened kitty across the street and
      disappears behind a house.

      After a moment, Norah emerges from behind the house. She coos
      at the small kitten cradled in her arms, then looks up. An
      expression of horror and disbelief sweep over her.

      Norah runs toward the house.

      A PEPPY WOMAN with the enthusiasm of a game show contestant
      stands on a stool and waves her arms.

                   Okay, ladies. For our first game
                   we've taken five different kinds of
                   candy bars and melted them in these
                   diapers.

                   You all can--

      Somewhere a cell phone rings. The peppy woman stops and looks
      at Rose. Rose digs into her purse and pulls out the offending
      phone. She checks caller ID. It's Norah. She cuts it off.

                             ROSE
                   Sorry.

      Rose forces a smile at Peppy who motions for someone to start
      distributing the diapers.

                             PEPPY
                   You can look, smell and taste. The
                   first to identify all five
                   correctly wins!

      Flames shoot up around the dresser and gobble a curtain.
      Norah slaps a towel at the flames with one hand and holds a
      phone with the other.

                             ROSE

      flames.

      It hits Rose that she does not belong here. And for the first
      time, she does not want to belong here. She turns to Paula.

                             ROSE
                   You know what? I... uh...Actually,

151   EXT. LAUGHING BUDDHA HOUSE - NIGHT                                151

      Rose pulls up near the fire trucks and still smoldering
      house. Rose steps from the car with an expression of horror.

      Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she
      sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones
      on. Kitten curled up in her lap.

      Rose marches over but Norah doesn't notice her until she raps
      on the window. Norah pulls off her headphones, opens the door
      and slides out of the van.

                             NORAH
                   It was an accident.

      Rose's mouth slackens as her mind stumbles over the probable
      consequences of the scene before her.

                             ROSE

      Rose throws her keys at Norah.

      Norah turns to shield the kitten. The keys thump her arm.
      Norah eyes her sister. So that's how it's gonna be.

                             NORAH
                   Well, if you had been here to help
                   me but no, you're off desperately
                   trying to impress stupid high
                   school people who don't even
                   matter. Prove to your old
                   cheerleading squad that you're not
                   this huge loser. If you had been
                   here doing your job it wouldn't
                   have happened. So don't try to put
                   all this on me.

      Norah's denial of responsibility knocks the wind from Rose.

                   This is on you. You did this. You

                   think that you could handle a

                          NORAH
                Fuck you. I'm done being your
                excuse.

      Norah, filthy with soot, turns and walks away from Rose, the
      fire and everything. The kitten clings to her shirt.

                          ROSE
                Oh that's great. Turn everything to
                shit and then walk away.

      Without turning or breaking her stride, Norah flips off Rose.

      Rose leans down and picks up her keys, then turns and watches
      the firemen hose down the house.


152   EXT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT                                 152

      Rose, looking worse for wear, tries to open the door but the
      store is closed and the door is locked.

                           ROSE
                Great.

      She bangs on the glass doors.


153   INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - NIGHT                                 153

      Winston walks from the back room and opens the door.

                          WINSTON
                Long baby shower.

                          ROSE
                I'm sorry, I... everything's
                horrible.

      Rose is about to break.

                          WINSTON
                Oscar's asleep in back.

                          ROSE
                Norah's ruined everything. She
                burnt down a house. A client's
                house.

                                WINSTON
                   Yeah.

                                ROSE
                   You know?

                             WINSTON
                   Carl told me.

                             ROSE
                   How does he...?

      Realization slaps.

                             ROSE
                   That's just great. We burnt down a
                   client's house. How do you get
                   around that?

                                WINSTON
                   Insurance?

      Rose shrugs.

                             ROSE
                   I figured we'd wait and get the
                   better rate once I got certified.

                             WINSTON
                   Didn't you go to that?

      Rose doesn't respond. She slowly blinks and lets her new
      reality ooze over her.

                             ROSE
                   There's not a lot I'm really good
                   at, you know.

      Winston looks at Rose.




                                                                  (CONTINUED)

                          ROSE
                Really. I'm good at getting guys to
                want me. Not date or marry me. But
                want me. I've always been good at
                that.

      Winston looks away.

                          ROSE
                And cheering. I was pretty good at
                that too.

                          WINSTON
                Cheering is good.

                          ROSE
                Yeah. Not as marketable as you'd
                think.

      Winston smiles.


154   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                             154

      Smoke slinks from a cigarette on the makeshift ashtray.

      Rose looks up to see Oscar in his PJs, one arm tucked in his
      shirt, the sleeve dangling empty. Rose musters a smile.

                          ROSE
                You brush your teeth?

      Oscar nods, kisses her good night. Rose watches him walk to
      his room and takes a drag from her cigarette.

      There's a knock at the door.


155   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                         155

      Rose looks through the peep hole and sees Mac fidgeting
      outside. She takes a step from the door and freezes.

      Mac knocks again.


156   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       156

      Mac looks at the unresponsive door with irritation. He shifts
      his weight and jangles some change in his pocket.

157   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                             157

      Rose leans against the wall with eyes closed.

                               MAC (O.S.)
                   Rose?

      She takes a breath, opens her eyes, then opens the door.

                             MAC
                   Hey beautiful.

      Mac smiles for the both of them.

                             MAC
                   I was starting to think you were on
                   a date or something.

      Rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.

                               MAC
                   You okay?

      Rose nods.

                               ROSE
                   Long day.

                             MAC
                   Can I come in?

                             ROSE
                   It's not really a good time.

      Mac sags a bit. Then rallies. Flexes an eyebrow.

                             MAC
                   I got you something.

      Mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to
      Rose. The top is engraved with her initials.

                             MAC
                   It's for your business cards. You
                   put `em in there and, I don't
                   know... impress people.

      He laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.

                             ROSE
                   It's beautiful.

      Rose stares at the small shiny box. It seems to make her sad.

                             MAC
                   You don't like it?

                             ROSE
                   No, I like it very much.

      Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.

                             ROSE
                   It's just this thing we're doing.

                             MAC
                   Come on, let's not do that.

      But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye.

                             ROSE
                   I don't want this anymore.

      Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.

                             MAC
                   So that's it?

      Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to
      ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.

                             MAC
                   That's it then.

      Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he
      nods and Rose watches him walk away.


158   INT. ALBUQUERQUE BLOOD SERVICES ­ ONE WEEK LATER - DAY            158

      Norah steps off the elevator. People in white coats walk past
      her, bump into her. Norah spots Lynn.

      Lynn sees Norah and looks away.

                             GUY IN WHITE COAT (O.S.)
                   Is this your first time donating?

      Norah turns to the GUY IN THE WHITE COAT addressing her. He

                             NORAH
                   I need to talk to Lynn.

      Lynn approaches.

                             LYNN
                   She can't donate. You can't donate.

      She points to a sign indicating how often people can donate.

                             LYNN
                   Forty-eight days. It's not been
                   forty-eight days.

                             NORAH
                   Why are you acting like this? Why
                   haven't you called me back.

                             LYNN
                   Listen, I just, don't think you're
                   the kind of person I need to be
                   hanging out with right now.

                             NORAH
                   What's that supposed to mean?

                             LYNN
                   Do I really need to spell it out?

      Norah stands stunned. Sad. Blank. She pulls the packet of
      photos out of her bag and holds them out to Lynn.

                             NORAH
                   Here.

      Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining
      blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can.

      A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an
      `I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.

      Joe sits on a bench near the pond with his feet propped up on
      a canister of Fancy Corn. He reaches into the open canister
      next to him and pulls out a handful of gourmet corn.

      A few pieces land in his mouth, the remainder he tosses to a
      flotilla of ducks. Joe smiles as the greedy little bastards
      squabble over his offering.

      Rose and Oscar struggle to unload the super wet-vac from the
      van. Other equipment litters pavement around the van.

      Winston records serial numbers onto a clipboard.

                          WINSTON
                I'm sure I can turn this stuff
                around pretty quick.

                          ROSE

                          OSCAR
                Are you coming to my party?

      Awkward moment. Rose looks from Oscar to Winston.

                          ROSE
                We're going to Hinkle's Saturday
                for Oscar's birthday. It'd be great
                if you came.

                          WINSTON
                Sounds like a blast.

      Rose smiles at the sincere enthusiasm in Winston's voice.


161   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                            161

      Rose steps out of the shower and wraps her hair in a towel.
      As she walks past the mirror she plucks off the affirmation
      note and tosses it in the trash.


162   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY               162

      Rose, Oscar, Joe and Winston sit in a carnival like
      restaurant. Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular
      case. He beams with anticipation.

      Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair
      of binoculars. Rose looks disappointed. Oscar looks confused.

                          JOE
                That other pair we looked at, full
                of gadgets and gimmicks.

                   They just didn't have the heft you
                   want in a pair of lenses. No
                   weight. No history.

      Oscar nods. Joe points to the old binoculars.

                             JOE
                   These here are the real deal. I
                   want you to have them.

      Oscar smiles. Rose shakes her head. It's not like she didn't
      see this coming. But still.

                             ROSE
                   Dad, you promised him those others.
                   From the store. He's been talking
                   about it for weeks.

      Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence.

                             JOE
                   No Rose, I want to him to have
                   these.

      Winston eyes the binoculars.

                             WINSTON
                   Wow, is that an old Zeiss?

      Joe nods.

                   Porro prism?

      Joe nods full of pride.

                             JOE
                   Eight by thirty Jenoptems. No marks
                   on the objectives. Perfect bloom.

      Winston looks at Oscar.

                   You got yourself some classic
                   binoculars there.

                       (to Winston)
                Hey.

      Norah kisses Joe on the cheek and ignores Rose. Rose gets up.

                          JOE
                Where are you going?

      Rose walks to the bathroom.


163   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - LADIES ROOM - DAY                       163

      Rose splashes water on her face. Norah walks in and leans
      against the counter. Rose makes no sign of acknowledgement.

      Norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister.

                          NORAH
                Winston cleans up pretty good.

      Rose isn't biting. She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans
      past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.

                             NORAH
                   I read somewhere that beauty is
                   really all about symmetry. Like
                   having eyes the same size and all
                   that.
                       (pause)
                   So, you know, when you factor that
                   in he's like, hot.

      Rose won't play. She dabs her face and ignores Norah. Norah
      walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.

                             NORAH
                   Listen, I know I fucked up, okay?
                   Like really huge and I know that
                   and I'm sorry, okay?

      It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just
      the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.

                             ROSE
                   God, that drives me crazy! That
                   whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a
                   big fuck up' routine. Like that's a
                   legitimate excuse.

      Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards
      Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.

                             NORAH
                   I really am sorry. But it really
                   isn't all my fault, Rose.

                             ROSE
                   I think there's something wrong
                   with you. The way your brain works.
                   I mean, what the hell? It's like
                   you can't be trusted with anything.
                   You just screw around all the time
                   like it's all a big fucking game.
                   It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not
                   all just here for your amusement.
                   You should have been paying
                   attention. You should have been
                   focused on the job.

      Rose finally hears herself. It's all the same old stuff. She
      grinds to a stop. She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault.

                I know. I should have been there.

                          NORAH
                What are you going to do now?

                          ROSE
                I got some ideas. I was thinking
                maybe we could--

      Norah shakes her head.

                          NORAH
                I've got my own ideas.

      Rose nods. As they exit, she turns to Norah.

                          ROSE
                So, you really think he's hot?

                          NORAH
                Winston? No.


164   INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - DAY                                 164

      Rose and Norah return from the bathroom. Joe eyeballs the
      girls in silent appraisal of the situation. Seems okay.

                          NORAH
                You gonna open my present?

      Oscar opens the package of fake tattoos.

                          OSCAR
                Cool.

                          NORAH
                The guy said that if you're careful
                they'll last a whole month. And
                these aren't stupid kiddie unicorns
                and shit. They're all based on
                classic biker designs.

      Oscar picks up one of the tattoos.

                   What's that say?

                             NORAH
                   Li'l bastard.

      Rose looks at Norah.

                             ROSE
                   Cool.

      Oscar slips his arm out of his sleeve and inside his shirt
      and stares at Winston admiringly. Rose whispers in Oscar's
      ear and he pulls his arm back into his sleeve.

                             NORAH
                   I'm thinking of taking a road trip.

                             JOE
                   Where?

      Shrug.

                             ROSE
                   How?

                             NORAH
                   Haven't worked it all out yet. I
                   was thinking I could maybe take the
                   van.

      Rose shakes her head.

                             ROSE
                   I'm selling the van.

                             JOE
                   Don't sell the van.

                             ROSE
                   Have to. Can't afford the payment.

                             JOE
                   No, listen... just don't sell the
                   van.

      Rose forces a smile and examines her pizza. She can't watch
      her father cling to another impotent dream.

      Oscar slowly retracts his arm again. With his remaining arm
      he lifts the binoculars to his face.

                          JOE
                Rose tells me you make models.

                          WINSTON
                Yeah.

                          JOE

      The wait staff begins to sing a birthday song.


165   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - OSCAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                      165

      Rose quietly kisses Oscar's forehead and pulls up the covers.
      She turns and steals another look before shutting the door.


166   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                          166

      Rose sizes up her stack of unopened bills. She opens one,
      sighs, sets it aside. She moves on to the next one.

      The TV flickers blue light into the room. Rose stops and
      looks at the TV.


167   INT. NORAH'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                         167

      The phone wakes Norah. She fumbles for the receiver.

                          NORAH
                What?

                          ROSE
                    (over the phone)
                Turn your TV on. Channel sixty-
                five.

      Norah clicks on the TV and watches slack-jawed as a WAITRESS
      hands menus to two hard nosed detectives. One of the TV
      DETECITVES looks up and smiles.

168   INT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       168

      As if in a dream Rose watches the image of her mother
      disappear off screen. She smiles.


169   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                       169

      Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with
      each step. She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine
      Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag.

      She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and
      candy bar wrappers into the trash bag. A faint sound nags at
      her. She looks up to see the CB on.

      Soft white static fills the van. Rose sits a long moment
      before taking the handset.

                             ROSE
                   Hello? Mom?

      Rose stops and looks around self-consciously before resuming.

                             ROSE
                   Oscar turned eight today. We had
                   this whole big thing at Hinkle's.
                   Winston came. After dinner Oscar
                   and Norah got a high score on
                   Centipede and put in ASS as their
                   initials and got in trouble by the
                   manager.

170   EXT. ROSE'S HOUSE - TWO MONTHS LATER - DAY                      170

      Rose pulls up in her Sentra. The Molly Maid magnet is back on
      the door and she's in her Molly Maid uniform. She gets out
      and sees Joe sitting on the steps to her house.

                          ROSE
                Dad?

      Rose pulls a vacuum cleaner from her car.

                          ROSE
                Okay.

                          JOE
                Well, I was wondering if I could
                move in with you and Oscar.

                          ROSE
                What?

                          JOE
                Just temporarily - until I find a
                place.

                          ROSE
                You lost the house. Oh my god, you
                lost the house. Dad how could you
                lose the house?

                          JOE
                I didn't lose the house. I sold the
                house. There's this business
                opportunity--

                   experience. I'd learn from her.

      Rose's edge softens slightly. She's listening now. Joe points
      to where the newly painted Econo van is parked.

      In bold cursive: LORKOWSKI CLEANING. Underneath in smaller
      letters: SPECIALIZING IN BIOHAZARD REMOVAL SINCE 1963.

                   It's a business lie, not a real
                   lie.

                             ROSE
                   I can live with that.

      With windows down, Norah drives across an open landscape. She
      glances at a wind battered map. A highlighted route cuts
      across the country. Destination - California.

      Norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee. She
      holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind.

      The girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the
      invisible strand over a pencil. She glances over to Oscar.
      Oscar doesn't flinch.

      With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls.
      It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting.

      Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal
      the Lil' Bastard tattoo. The girl smiles. Oscar smiles.

      Norah walks down a corridor. The kitten clings to her. She
      turns the corner and walks though a set of doors to what
      looks to be a play room.

      Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground.
      Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black
      gorilla. KOKO. She turns her massive head and looks at Norah.

                             KOKO
                       (captions)
                   I have a tooth ache.

      KoKo responds with thick hands.

    Instead we get:

    INT. SETH'S CAR - MORNING

    Seth, seventeen, a bit heavyset, in the midst of a sad
    attempt at growing a goatee and clearly a terrible driver,
    cruises along while fiddling with the CD player. He pulls out
    his cell and dials.

                           SETH
              Yo.

    Evan, seventeen, a little too tall and slim, a boy who
    clearly never figured out how to style his hair, is finishing
    off a bowl of cereal. He is on his cell phone.

                           EVAN
              What's up?

                        SETH
              I was doing research last night, for next
              year, and I think I'm gonna go with Bang
              Bus.

                        EVAN
              Which one's Bang Bus?

                        SETH
              The one where they bang the chicks on the
              bus. Thirteen bucks a month. Total
              access, live Web Cam feed. The works.
              It'll be like I'm on the bus, banging
              them myself.

                        EVAN
              That stuff's bullshit, they're all faking
              it. And plus, your parents are gonna look
              at the bill.

                         SETH
              It shows up under a different name.
                  (beat)
              I hope. Bang Bus.

                 That wouldn't look good. Maybe I should
                 just pick the one with the least dirty
                 sounding name.

                           EVAN
                 Weapons of Ass Destruction's out then.

    Seth pulls up in front of a house.

                           SETH
                 I could tell my parents I'm doing a
                 project on Rome and I have to research
                 orgies.

    Evan walks out his front door. WE REVEAL he is walking
    towards Seth's car.

                           EVAN
                     (still into phone)
                 Yeah. Just tell them your taking a class
                 on blow jobs.

    They both hang up and Evan gets in the car. Seth is about to
    pull away, when EVAN'S MOTHER comes out the front door.

                           EVAN'S MOM
                 Thanks for taking him, Seth.

    Evan changes the radio station. Seth slaps his hand.

                           SETH
                 Don't touch that!

                           EVAN'S MOM
                 You two are so funny. I can't imagine
                 what you'll do without each other next
                 year. Evan told me you didn't get into
                 State.

                           SETH
                 Yeah, you know. I got some other places.
                 Good places. I think we'll be fine.

                           EVAN'S MOM
                 Are you going to miss each other?



                           EVAN
                 Miss each other? No!

                 That's disgusting.

                              MOM
                 Bye, boys.

    Seth and Evan drive off.

                           SETH
                 I am truly, truly jealous that you got to
                 suck on those tits when you were a baby.

                           EVAN
                 Fuck you, man.

    They drive up to Clark Secondary. There is a giant sign that
    reads "Seniors - Two Glorious Weeks Until Graduation". Seth
    turns into the STAFF parking lot.

    INT/EXT. 7-11 STORE - MOMENTS LATER
5                                                                         5

    Seth and Evan walk past a group of smokers, towards the 7-11.

                           EVAN
                 You're being an idiot, man. You really
                 shouldn't park there.

                           SETH
                 Fuck it. I'm a senior about to graduate.
                 They should be suckin' my balls. It's the
                 least they can do for stealing three
                 years of my life.

    They walk past DIMITRI (18, big Native American guy) as they
    enter the store. Dimitri aggressively bumps his shoulder into
    Seth.

                           EVAN
                 What the hell's wrong with Dimitri?

                           SETH
                 Oh, yeah dude, I forgot to tell you. I
                 knocked the fuckin' shit out of him in
                 capture the flag last week.

                           EVAN
                 Good! 9th Grade Camp he gave me whiplash
                 in "King of the Ring." I fucking hate
                 that guy.

    They go to the magazine rack and stare at a Maxim cover.

                 Look at those nipples.

                           SETH
                 They're like baby toes.

                           EVAN
                 It's not fair. I have to hide every
                 erection I get.

                           SETH
                 Sometimes I get boners so big I can't
                 hide them. And then I get nervous and my
                 heart starts pounding, and it all just,
                 like, feeds my boner. It just becomes
                 this...thing...that's attached to me. And
                 it won't go away.

                           EVAN
                 Just imagine if girls weren't weirded out
                 by our boners and they actually wanted to
                 see `em, like this shit.

                           SETH
                 You know it's been, like, a year and a
                 half since I've seen an actual human
                 female nipple. Besides my mom's. I saw it
                 last month, and it was sick.

                           EVAN
                 Holy shit. Liat was two years ago? I
                 guess so. She was insanely hot, though.

                           SETH
                 Exactly. Too hot. That's what sucks.

                           EVAN
                 How can that possibly suck? I'd be
                 fuckin' psyched if I'd gotten with a girl
                 that hot. You got, like, two dozen
                 handjobs!

                           SETH
                 And three quarters of a blowjob, But that
                 was fuckin' it. It was the peak of my ass-
                 gettin' career, and it happened way, way,
                 way too early.

                           EVAN
                 You're like Orson Welles.

                        SETH
              Exactly! If I'd built up to it, I'd
              probably at least be having steady sex
              with a mediocre-looking girl at this
              point. I honestly now see why Orson
              Welles ate his fat ass to death.

                        EVAN
              You'll have sex in college. Everyone
              does. And if not, you'll have the Bang
              Bus.

                        SETH
              But the key is to be good at sex by the
              time you're in college. You don't want
              girls to think you suck dick at fucking.

                        EVAN
              I still think you've got a chance with
              Jules. She got mad hot over last summer,
              and clearly hasn't realized it, `cause
              she still flirts with you.

                        SETH
              Are you joking, man? Let's see here...she
              dated Dan Remick, Matt Muir, Josh Corber
              and what's-his-face. All of those were
              cool guys. She's been hot way longer than
              you think. Why would she end her high
              school career with me?

                        EVAN
              Well, Helen got with Ariel Shafir.

                        SETH
              Yeah, and he was a complete fucking
              loser. You're a step up from that. Which
              is why you should stop being a pussy and
              do her! You could nailthe shit out of
              her for, like, two months before you
              leave. That bitch looks like a good
              fucker.

                        EVAN
              Hey! I'm sick of you talking about her
              like that, man!

    Evan starts to walk out. Seth follows.

                        SETH
              What, you can talk about that bitch all
              day every single day, but I can't say one
              thing about her?

              I don't constantly insult her.

                        SETH
              I didn't insult her! I said she looks
              like a good fucker! She looks like she
              can take a dick. That's a good thing.
              Some women pride themselves on their dick-

    Seth and Evan come out the front doors. TERRY, one of the
    rough-looking smokers, calls out.

                        TERRY
              Yo. Seth. Did you hear I'm having the big
              grad party?

    Evan, a little scared, keeps his distance.

                        SETH
              No.

                        TERRY
              Yeah.

    Terry spits on Seth's shirt.

                        TERRY (CONT'D)
              And you're not coming. Tell your fucking
              faggot friend he can't come either.

    Seth wipes the spit off. He looks at Terry and seems as
    though he's about to say something, but is interrupted when
    Terry starts hocking up more spit. Seth runs away as Terry
    and his friends laugh. He catches up to Evan and they head
    back to school.

                        EVAN
              Wow. You really bitched out on that one.

                         SETH
              I bitched out? You bitched out! You were

    BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF A P.E. CLASS

    There are 30 guys standing behind the starting line of the
    school's track. We hear a TEACHER yell "Go!" and the boys
    start running.

    We FOLLOW them from above. All the boys keep pretty much the
    same pace except for one runner who slowly lags behind. The
    group gets so far ahead of the him that he is alone in the
    frame. He stops.

    CLOSE UP OF THE RUNNER:

    Kneeling on the track breathing heavily. It's Seth.

                           SETH
                     (panting)
                     This...is...bullshit.

    A moment later a KID with prosthetic leg jogs by.

                     (as he passes Seth)

    Evan is sitting in math class staring at HELEN'S breasts.
    She`s a very tall girl and is athletic in a sexy way, wearing
    volleyball team sweat pants and a tank top. He looks up from
    her breasts to her face: she is staring right at him. He
    immediately looks to the front of the class, embarrassed.

    The bell rings and everyone leaves. Helen walks up to Evan as
    they enter the hallway. He's really nervous. She offers him a
    pen.

                           HELEN
                 Hey Evan, thanks for the pen.

                           EVAN
                 Oh, don't worry, no worries. Just keep
                 it. Then you'll just have it, and you
                 won't have to borrow another pen.

                           HELEN
                 Thanks...uh...I was going to ask you, did
                 you hear about Terry's grad party? It's
                 going to be so insane.

                           EVAN

                 there's so much other fun shit that is
                 going to be going on that night...so, you
                 know...

                           HELEN
                 Fun shit? But I, like, never see you at
                 any parties or anything.

                           EVAN
                 Because of all the other fun shit I'm off
                 doing.

                           HELEN
                     (playful)
                 Okay. So why weren't you at Dimitri's
                 party on Saturday?

                           EVAN
                 Dimitri's? I uh...didn't want to go,
                 because, well, I did other stuff.
                 Saturday...
                     (nervous, he desperately
                      thinks)
                 Oh yeah! Saturday night was awesome!

    (The real version of Evan's story is shown through a montage
    of quick flashbacks.)

                 First my parents went out to a double

    Seth is there. Evan and him are surfing the Bang Bus web
    site. FOGELL arrives with a bottle of Sambuca. Fogell is one
    of those seniors who looks like he's thirteen years old.

                           EVAN
                 ...and we had a couple drinks in my
                 basement...

    An empty bottle of Sambuca in front of them and empty beer
    cans at their feet, the three boys each shotgun a beer.

                           EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O)
                 ...and Seth's parents were having this

     Seth's parents are having a fancy cocktail party. The boys
     are drunk as hell.

                         EVAN
               ...and there were actually some really
               interesting and, like, entertaining
               people there...

     The boys laugh hysterically as they each shake Tobassco Sauce
     onto their tongues. They writhe around in agony as several
     adults look at them like they are morons.

                         EVAN (CONT'D) (V.O.)
               ...and, uh, then we saw some, uh, live

     In Seth's basement, the boys violently wrestle. Evan gives
     Fogell a bloody nose, but they all can't help but laugh.

     The bouncer of a dirty strip club rejects them.

                         EVAN

               That sounds so fun. I would love to go do
               something like that.

                  So, are you guys going to the same school

                            HELEN
                  What are you going to do without him?

     Students file into the home economics room. The blackboard
     reads, TODAY: TIRAMISU. The ingredients are listed below.

     Seth is talking to the cooking teacher.

                  Mrs. Grier, I joined this class because I
                  thought I'd be cooking with a partner.
                  It's not fair. She's never here. I don't
                  get twice the marks for doing all the
                  work.

                            MRS. GREIR
                  I didn't invent odd numbers, Seth.

                            SETH
                  Look at Evan.

     Evan is playfully throwing flour at a tiny Japanese boy. They
     both laugh hard.

                  While I'm over in my unit, isolated and
                  alone, eating my terrible-tasting food
                  because I can't even properly mix
                  ingredients by myself, I gotta look over
                  at that.

     The Japanese boy ties Evan's apron. Evan then turns around
     and ties the boy's apron. They both look happy.

                  I wash and dry. And that is B.S. I'm like

                  Well, save it for next week. Today Jules'
                  partner isn't here either. Pair up with
                  her. Station four.

                            SETH
                  Jules?

     The teacher walks away. Seth looks over to station four,
     nervous as hell.

     ANGLE ON: Jules, well-dressed and "popular" looking.       She
     stands alone at station four, laying out utensils.

     Seth musters his courage and walks towards Jules. He stops,
     unsure of what to say.

                  Well, uh, maybe I kidnapped her so you'd
                  be forced to work with me. There's my
                  attempt at humour.

                  Well, I would call that a success.

               actually moldy. Like, they tell you it's

     Evan is standing by the sink scrubbing a tray. Behind him, at

               That's good shit. Huh, Miroki?

                  I told her what time it was. It was
                  awesome. She's got the nicest ass.

                  Like you'd know what to do with it.

                  Yeah, well I'll be at Junior college
                  where the girls are half as smart, and
                  thus twice as likely to blow me.

                  a pussy, but he was wrong. It's been
                  arranged. At lunch, I'm going to the same
                  place Mike Snider went to pick up my
                  brand new false identification card.

                  didn't you just say that you heard about

                  Shut up. Who cares? Just be happy he
                  told. And hey! Now you can buy the booze.

                  Sounds cool. Cool.

               I would do terrible things to get with

               No shit. I'd give my left foot to start

                  I'm beginning you think you like her.

                            EVAN
                  Why?

                             SETH
                  I was never going to tell you this story,
                  because I knew that if you heard it you
                  would never want to get with Helen, but
                  over the last few weeks I've been having
                  a hard time thinking of a reason not to.
                  So, here it is. Helen and I went to
                  elementary school together, right?

                  Well, in the third grade, I

               other people would have thought. So I

                  Well, funny thing about my back. It's
                  located on my cock.

     Shirley is offended. Jules laughs a little. Seth laughs too
     hard.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  Ha! Alright, sure. I can do that. What do
                  you guys want?

                            JULES
                  Well, this is actually, like, a big
                  favor, but, well, my parents gave me like
                  a hundred bucks to feed myself for the
                  week, but the house if full of food, so I
                  figure I should just spend all of it on
                  extra drinks for the party.

                            SETH
                  Wow. I would never even think of doing
                  something that nice.

     Jules hands Seth a hundred dollars.

               Well, this is really nice of you. I mean,
               I really appreciate this.

     Seth can't believe what he's hearing. He can barely contain
     his smile.

                         SETH

               like, I don't really know.

               I want Mike's Hard Lemonade.

                         JULES
               Okay. I'll see you tonight.

                         SETH
               Yeah! I'll see you!

     The girls walk off, leaving Seth lost in thought. He suddenly
     runs down the hall.

                         GYM TEACHER
               Evan, get into the game.

     Evan says nothing and the teacher soon redirects his
     attention elsewhere. Evan sees Seth jogging towards him.

               Man, just - Evan, listen to me. You know
               Jules? You know what she just did? She
               came up to me and asked me if I would buy
               her alcohol. Not just her, her whole
               party. Do you know what that means? It
               means that by some miracle, we were
               paired up, we talked, and she actually
               thought of me afterwards. Thought of me
               enough to decide that I was the guy that
               she was going to trust the fun-ness of
               her party with. She wants me! She fucking
               wants my dick!

                  You do the same thing, man! Buy Helen her
                  alcohol. Then, tonight, when you guys are
                  both drunk, get with her! This is the
                  last party we're ever going to go to as

                  hatred for Helen in coming up with this,

               thinking I could buy you yours, if you
               needed someone to.

               Yeah! That'd be great, that'd save me
               such a hassle, cause I was going to beg
               my sister, but yeah, could you get me,
               like, a bottle of Goldschlager? I'll pay
               you back tonight.

                  No! That's why you picked a bad name.

               You probably have federal agents tracking
               you for even considering the name
               Muhammad on a fake ID!

               Look at this shit man, you don't even
               have a first name. It just says "NAME:
               MCLOVIN"

                           EVAN
               One name?

                         FOGELL
               I just thought McLovin sounded old, and
               the chicks would dig it.

                         EVAN
               Under what circumstances would you ever
               have to show a chick your ID?

               She could ask. Or, I could just show it
               to her.

                         SETH
               Holy shit! I don't believe this. This
               says you're fucking 25! Why didn't you
               just put 21?

                          FOGELL
               I knew you would ask that. Look, every
               day, dozens of kids roll into the liquor
               store with fake ID's trying to act like
               Joe Casual. Each and every one of these
               kids just so happens to be 21 years old.
               Just how many 21 year-olds do you think
               there are?

                           SETH
               Fool!

               Calm down! It's not terrible! This might
               work, but it's up to you, Fogell. They'll
               either think, "Oh, it's another punk kid
               with a fake ID." Or, "Look, it's McLovin,
               the twenty five year-old organ donor".
               What's it gonna be?

     Fogell takes a deep breath.

               You're not McLovin. No one's McLovin and
               this is never going to work. We need a

     Evan and Seth, carrying an empty two liter bottle of Coke,
     cautiously descend the creaking staircase. Their eyes watch
     the TV room, where Evan's mom is on the phone. The boys enter
     the dining room and cautiously open the liquor cabinet. Seth

     pours the gin in. Evan starts refilling the gin bottle with

     closes the cabinet and sneaks off right before his mom
     enters. Through the window she see's that Seth is already on
     the front lawn and thinks nothing of it.

                            FOGELL
                  What?! No! Hell no! You can't do that!

                      (mocking)
                  Yeah, right!

                            SETH
                  That's right. And that way I give Jules
                  back her money, like you did with Helen.
                  That was good thinking, that's fucking
                  pimp. That's how you seal a deal. It
                  won't be hard. Remember Dan Vertlieb
                  stole a keg from here and he's got, like,
                  really bad scoliosis!

                            EVAN
                  You're not gonna steal it. Fogell, he's
                  not going to steal it.

                            FOGELL
                  Please. Don't do this! I promise. I'll
                  get the liquor later.

                            SETH
                  I'm stepping up. And once I'm up, I don't
                  step back down. Maybe you "State" boys
                  don't understand that.

     Seth walks to the store.

     Seth enters the store, looking determined. He spots a
     SECURITY GUARD standing by one of the registers.

                            SETH
                      (to himself)
                  Hope piggy can run.

     He walks past the registers, which brings him in front of the
     long liquor aisle. He surveys the scene. There is an OLD
     WOMAN browsing the shelves. Seth looks over to the registers.

     Seth is at the cash register. He has a huge amount of booze
     in the conveyor belt.

                  You certainly are. That'll be eighty
                  dollars.

     Seth hands the cashier a big EIGHTY DOLLAR BILL.

                            SETH
                  Thank you kindly.

     Seth, still standing in front of the liquor aisle, shakes his
     head. He eyeballs the old lady.

     The old lady is browsing. She drops her big purse. A hand
     reaches down and picks it up. It's Seth.

                            SETH
                  Excuse me, ma'am. You dropped your purse.
                  Would you like me to help you to your
                  car?

                            OLD LADY
                  That would be lovely, young man. Would
                  you like me to buy you alcohol?

     Seth, holding two huge bags of liquor, waves to the Old Lady
     as she drives away.

                            SETH
                  Enjoy your remaining years!

     Seth shakes his head. He looks down the aisle again, takes a
     breath and starts walking.

     He arrives at a fancy looking bottle. He takes it and looks
     down at it in his hands. A big golden label reads,
     "GOLDSCHLAGER."

                            SECURITY GAURD (O.S.)
                  Don't do it kid.

     We see that the Security Guard is right behind him. Seth
     doesn't look up, he just stares at the bottle dramatically.

                            SETH
                  I never had a choice.

     He throws the bottle at the guards face. The guard blocks it
     with his billy club, grabs another bottle, and hurls it at
     Seth. Seth dodges it by an inch; the bottle hits the OLD LADY
     in the head.

                            OLD LADY
                      (in agony)
                  AAAHHHHH!!!

     Before Seth can do anything, the guard smashes a 40-ounce
     bottle of beer across his face. The guard SWINGS the broken
     end of the bottle and cuts Seth's throat. Blood spurts out.
     Seth drops his bottles and falls to the ground.

                  Sambuca again.

     At first it all seems overwhelming. Fogell is confused,
     dizzy, and sweating. He steps behind a large beer display and
     takes a few deep breaths.

     Fogell flinches, shocked someone spoke to him. He keeps
     walking. He nears a mother and her 17 year old SON. As Fogell
     passes them, the son seems to recognize him. Fogell clearly
     recognizes the son. Their eyes meet. Fogell looks in the
     opposite direction.

     He puts his head down and quickly walks away. He arrives at
     the beer and cooler section. Clearly intimidated, he slowly
     opens a beer fridge. He grabs one beer attached to a six-pack
     and pulls it forward. The beer comes loose in his hand as the
     other five fall to the ground, cracking on impact, and
     spraying beer all over the place. Fogell scrambles to stop
     the beers from spraying, but soon finds that it is
     impossible.

                                 FOGELL
                  Fuck.

     A CLERK approaches Fogell.

                            CLERK
                  Is there a problem, sir?

                            FOGELL
                  Umm, nope, no problem whatsoever.

                      (pointing to the beer on the
                       floor)
                  Sir, did you do this? On the floor?

                  I think it happened before.

     Fogell is standing in a puddle of beer with beer sprayed all
     over his legs, holding a can of beer.

     Fogell has a shopping cart filled with booze. He gets in line
     to pay. He looks ahead to the OLD-LOOKING GUY (35) who is
     currently at the CASHIER (woman) paying.

                         CASHIER
               Um, yes, may I please see some ID?

                         OLD-LOOKING GUY
               No problem. Heh. I haven't been ID-ed in
               years.

                         CASHIER
               Anyone who looks under thirty-five.

     The guy looks through his wallet. Fogell nervously watches.

               It's a good ID, right? Mike Snider never

               Yeah, I figured, you know, might as well.
               I brought one of those little things of
               spermicidal lube too.

     He takes them out of his pocket.

                  No. That wasn't the plan! We had a plan!
                  I can't believe you did that without even
                  consulting me about it!

                  I don't really even understand what your
                  plan is.

                            SETH
                  I'm gonna go down on her for, like,
                  hours. She'll love that. She'll want to
                  go out with that.

                            EVAN
                  Yeah, but I figured there's no harm in
                  bringing just one little condom.

                            SETH
                  And one little bottle of spermicidal
                  lube. That's nuts. You can't let her know
                  you brought that! These girls are 18, not
                  dried up old ladies. They're ready to go.

                            EVAN
                  Fine. I won't bring the lube.

     Fogell pushes his stuff up to the Cashier. She looks at him

     She rings up a six pack of Budweiser.

                            FOGELL (CONT'D)
                  Oh, I love that stuff. Been drinking it
                  for years. I heard they recently decided
                  to start adding more hops.

     Fogell just nods kind of proud of himself. She stops ringing
     stuff up and looks at him.

                  kind of reshaped them nicer. Made them
                  more supple.

                      (to cashier)

                  We need a new way of getting liquor.
                      (realizing)
                  AAAHHH!! The money! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! How
                  much money can you get?

                            EVAN
                  What are you talking about? Money? What
                  about Fogell?

                            SETH
                  That doesn't matter anymore. I just lost
                  a hundred dollars of Jules' money!

                            EVAN
                  We have to help him!

                            SETH
                  Help him? What are we gonna do? Bust him
                  out of jail? I don't even know where jail
                  is! What we need is the alcohol, which is
                  impossible because we don't have any
                  fucking money!

     Seth steps into the driveway leading to the parking lot.

                            EVAN
                  Fine. Just...calm down. We need to think.
                  We need to think.

                            SETH
                  Fuck thinking! We need to act!

     Suddenly, a car pulls out of the lot going 10 mph and knocks
     Seth down!!!

     The cops are still talking to Fogell. He looks completely
     flustered. He's lost his composure.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Okay, your name is just McLovin, there's
                  no need to get irrational.

     In the BACKGROUND (not in the view of Fogell and the cops) we
     see DRIVER of the car, a shady-looking guy in a hockey
     jersey, gets out of his car and walks over to where Seth is
     lying, apologizing frantically.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  A lot of people have strange names these

                  I once arrested a man-lady who was
                  legally named "Pearl Necklace."

                            FOGELL
                  It's just... I changed my name. I was
                  going to be a singer. R&B.

                  Fine. That's not illegal.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  And, how old are you McLovin?

     Fogell looks down at the bags of booze again.

                            FOGELL
                  Old enough.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Old enough for what?

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Can I see your ID?

                            FOGELL
                  Um...okay...

     Fogell takes his shaking, sweaty hand, sticks it in his
     pocket, and pulls out his fake ID. He slowly hands it over to
     Officer Slater. The cops both look at it, then Fogell. Beads
     of sweat are running down Fogell's face.

     In the background, Seth pops up and starts kicking the guy's
     car out of anger. Evan and the driver both restrain Seth.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  You're an organ donor?

                            FOGELL
                  What?

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I didn't want to be one but my wife
                  insisted.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  Just like a woman. Even after you're
                  dead, they want to tear your heart out.

     The officers start laughing. Fogell is shocked. They hand
     back the ID.

               Look. I'm really sorry, but I don't
               really have any information. I didn't
               really see him. His fist hit here.

     Fogell points at his giant black eye.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               Are you in a hurry or something?

                         FOGELL
               Uh, yeah... kinda. I kinda had to catch a
               bus.

                         OFFICER SLATER
               Where were you going?

                         FOGELL
               Umm... near thirteenth and Granville.

                         OFFICER SLATER
               We'll take you there, get your

     The boys enter the house and stand by the front door of the
     huge party. It's in full swing with all sorts of random-
     looking people. Nobody is under the age of 25.

                            EVAN
                  This is weird.

                  Whatever. Just act casual. And old. All
                  we gotta do is find the booze and haul
                  ass out of here.

     As they make their way down a hallway, a few people give them
     looks.

     They enter the kitchen, where Seth spots what they've been
     looking for. There are big buckets of ice filled with beer,
     coolers, wine, vodka, everything.

                            SETH
                  Holy shit! Let's grab one of these
                  buckets and go.

                            MARK (O.S.)
                  What the fuck do you think you're doing?

                            DRIVER (O.S.)
                  What, man? It's nothing.

     The guys turn and see that in corner of the kitchen, the
     Driver, holding a phone, is being yelled at by a massive
     brute, MARK.

                            MARK
                  You calling more of your stupid friends
                  again? Ya prick.

                            DRIVER
                  Mark, calm down, okay? Just relax.

                            MARK
                  Get the fuck out of my house.

                            DRIVER
                  Mark, come on. What the heck? Don't be a
                  dick.

     Suddenly, Mark grabs the Driver by the back of the neck and
     drags him out of the kitchen, down the front hall and out the
     door. A group of people follow, including Seth and Evan.

     The Driver get pushed out of the door and lands on the front
     lawn. Seth and Evan watch from the doorway of the house, a
     group of people in front of them.

                  Mark! Dude! This is bullshit! Just chi-

     Mark steps on the Driver's hand.

                            DRIVER (CONT'D)
                  Ahhhh! Fuck!

     The Driver takes his hand out from under Mark's foot. He
     stands up.

                            DRIVER (CONT'D)
                  Fuck you, man. I'll fucking do this!

     Suddenly, Mark becomes enraged. He takes a big step forward
     and brutally KICKS the Driver square in the nuts!

     The Driver clutches his nuts and falls to the ground.

                            MARK
                  Francis, you and your idiot friends stay
                  the away from me and mine or I'll
                  flipping shiv your ass!

     Mark and his buddies head back in, leading them towards Seth
     and Evan, who quickly duck back into the party.

     The frightened boys walk into one of the first rooms and hide
     in the corner. They have a hushed discussion.

                            EVAN
                  Dude, let's slip out the back.

                            SETH
                  Why? Come on, we're here. Let's just
                  hurry up and do this.

                            EVAN
                  You want to end up like that guy? Not me,
                  I need my nuts.

                            SETH
                  We need this liquor!

                            EVAN
                  You need it! I don't need it. I'm going
                  to tell Helen I like her, and then maybe
                  she'll get with me; not after I get her
                  stinking drunk.

                  where's the fucking beef?!

                  We're leaving, okay? These guys could
                  kill us. You want to get killed for

                  to be, then I'll get the booze on my own.
                  And you're not getting any. And neither

     Fogell sits in the backseat. The cops are in the front. There
     is silence for a few beats.

                  Um...hey...uh, officers. I could answer
                  those, uh, questions now if you want.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  We get the gist of it. You were buying
                  some beer, some guys came in and robbed
                  the place. I don't think we're gonna find
                  `em this time.

     The officers start to chuckle.

                  Only one guy? Well, fuck that. We could
                  never catch one guy.

                            OFFICER MICHAELS
                  You see, McLovin, if it was two guys,
                  we'd have twice the chance of catching
                  one of them. But just one guy? I mean,
                  how are we supposed to find one guy in
                  this whole city?

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Yeah, McLovin. You know how many people
                  there are in this city? I have trouble
                  finding people I know.

                  Aren't you guys supposed to be trained or
                  something? Don't you have a computer?

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  Yeah, that stuff can help, but if someone
                  walks up to me on the street, and is
                  like, "Hey, find Bob." Well, how the hell
                  am I supposed to do that?

                  Exactly. If I don't know who he is, then
                  how am I supposed to know where he is?

     Seth enters a room of people dancing to hip-hop. He notices
     all the girls are drinking Mike's Hard Lemonade, and then
     locates a cooler full of it across the dance area.

     He tries to make his way through the sea of dancing. A hot,
     sorority-type WOMAN drunk out off her ass dances over to him
     and starts grinding against his leg. He doesn't know how to
     react so he just goes with it, bumpin' and grindin' with the

     Slater runs at the Homeless Guy and chases him into the
     dining area. The Homeless Guy knocks over a table, which
     Slater trips over.

                  NO!!!

     The Homeless Guy makes a mad dash for the kitchen, and Fogell
     is the only one in his way!

     The kitchen staff watch in awe as the Homeless Guy wrestles
     Fogell on the ground.

               Ow!!! Please! Stop, you fucking bum!!!

     The Homeless Guy gets up, grabs Fogell and HURLS him into a
     rack of trays! He then turns to run, but SLIPS on a wet spot
     and SLAMS his head against the ground! The cops burst into
     the room to find Fogell panting on his knees with the
     Homeless Guy unconscious on the floor.

     An R&B slow jam plays as an exuberant Seth, a Mike's Hard
     Lemonade in one hand and the Woman's ass in the other as the
     dancing becomes increasingly sexual. As the song ends, the
     Woman moves on.

     Seth glances at the cooler and sees one more Mike's hard. He
     grabs it and puts it in his pocket. The bulge is apparent.

     Extremely pleased with himself,

     Seth walks into the adjacent room. There are a bunch of GUYS
     chilling on the couch, who all look at Seth oddly as he
     enters.

                         SETH
               Hey, wut up?

     The guys just nod at Seth and continue to look at him
     strangely.

     Thinking he's busted, Seth quickly covers the bulge in his
     pocket.

                            SETH
                  Uh...no. What? I don't know what you're

                  I didn't spill anything on myself.

     Seth checks himself to see what the guy is referring to.

                              SETH (CONT'D)
                  Oh shit.

     On Seth's upper thigh there is a red splotch about the size
     of a palm of a hand.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  What the hell is this?

                  It's fucking blood.

     Guy 1 brings six more guys, including the Enormous Guy, into
     the room. He points out the stain Seth's pants. All the guys
     burst out laughing. Embarrassed and fearful of the attention,
     Seth starts making his way out of the room.

               Yeah. It's really funny, huh? Yuk it up,

                  So, yeah, you gotta look in different
                  places. The gym, an art class, you know,

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I met the Missus at paint ball. Can you
                  believe that? I shot her in the neck, and
                  we just hit it off. And my first wife --
                  who is a whore -- where do you think we
                  met? A bar.

                            FOGELL
                  I don't know. I find they're always good

     The cops laugh.

                            OFFICER SLATER
                  I bet I know your trick, McLovin. You do

     Fogell thinks for a moment, he is feeling rather comfortable.

                            FOGELL
                  Well, officers, it's not the going with
                  the ladies I care about, it's the coming.

     He sees that the cops clearly like him; his confidence level
     increased, he takes a chance.

               Hey! Helen. Hi. I had bad reception. Are
               you at the party?

                         HELEN
               No, I'm in a cab. I'll be there soon. Are
               you still coming?

                         EVAN
               Yeah, definitely. Um, about your

     Evan can hear all the girls goofing around and giggling.

                      (whispering to the girls)
                  Shut up.

                  What's going on there?

                            HELEN
                  Oh, nothing, I just wanted to make sure
                  you were still coming, you know, and that
                  you didn't get caught up at a cocktail
                  party or some club.

                            EVAN
                  Nope. I'm gonna be there.

                            HELEN
                  Well, I can't wait to see you.

                            EVAN
                  I think it's going to be a real
                  fun...event.

     Evan hangs up the phone. A huge smile crosses his face. As he
     turns around to exit, five older, unbelievably drunk DUDES
     wander into the room.

                            DUDE 1
                  They're going to kill that guy, man. That
                  bitch's boyfriend is so pissed.

                            DUDE 2
                  Yeah. And he's a beast.

     They start pouring a baggy of coke on the table when one of
     them notices Evan standing in the corner.

                            DUDE 3
                  Hey! Was it you? Are you the guy? The kid
                  with the splotch on his crotch?

     Evan glances down at his crotch. He is confused and
     horrified.

                            EVAN
                  No. What splotch-

                  I know you! Guys! I know that guy, he was
                  at that party with me.

                              DUDE 4
                  Who's he?

                            DUDE 2
                  He's Jimmy's brother. The dude with the
                  crazy raps, the one I told you about!

     They draw the coke into lines as Evan slowly heads for the
     door.

                            EVAN
                  Oh no, that's not me either. Wrong guy,
                  man. Sorry.

     Dude 3 gets up and blocks the door.

                            DUDE 3
                  No. No, that's you, man. You are fully
                  Jimmy's brother! You were just so messed
                  up you can't remember.

                            EVAN
                  Trust me, man. That wasn't me. I don't
                  even listen to rap.

                            DUDE 3
                  It was you! I know it! Come on! Rap! I've
                  been telling these guys about you. Just
                  give them one rap. Come on. Rap. Rap.

     They start doing the lines of coke. Evan is very afraid.

     Seth is finishing pouring the beer bottles into the second
     detergent jug. There are about thirty empty beer bottles
     laying around Seth. He tightens the cap, picks up the two
     detergent jugs, and heads upstairs.

     Seth emerges from the basement and heads towards the front
     door.

                            SETH
                  I did it man. Peace out-tro.

     He's inches away from the front door, when suddenly-

                  There! That's the guy!

     Seth turns and sees Mark, the guy who assaulted the Driver,
     walking towards him. He notices Mark has a splotch on his
     leg, too.

                            SETH
                  Hey! You got one, too! We're blood

                  hell were you doing dancing with
                  Jacinda?

     Horrified, Seth scrambles for excuses.

                            SETH
                  I...I didn't dance with her! I don't even

                  I don't know. Maybe me and you rubbed up

     The coked-up dudes are watching Evan intensely. They are
     completely loving his rapping, completely into it. Evan is
     struggling.

     There is a crowd gathered around Seth and Mark. The Enormous
     Guy and Mark's friends are gathered beside Mark.

                  I swear to God it wasn't me!

     Evan and the four dudes who were doing coke walk into the
     room. Evan is shocked to see Seth at the center of so much
     commotion. Mark notices the detergent bottle in Seth's hands.

                            MARK
                  And what the fuck is this?

                            SETH
                  It's nothing. It's detergent.

                            MARK
                  Yeah. And what are you doing with it?

     Mark sees the bottle of MIKE'S HARD LEMONADE in Seth's pocket
     and takes it out. He looks at it, then looks at Seth with a
     look of death.

                            SETH (CONT'D)
                  I brought them from home.

     Suddenly, Mark violently SHOVES Seth and throws the beer
     bottle at his face!!! Seth holds up a detergent jug and
     deflects the beer bottle.

     Dude 1 clutches his bloody head as the other Dudes charge at
     Mark! A full on brawl breaks out! Everyone starts fighting!
     Two of the Dudes beat on the Enormous Guy. They throw him
     into Evan.

     Evan reluctantly holds the Enormous Guy up as the two Dudes
     pound on him.

     ANGLE ON: Seth, cowering in the corner

     Mark runs at Seth and is about to punch him, when suddenly
     Dude 1 tackles him onto the kitchen island! Seth turns and
     faces Mark's girlfriend, JACINDA.

                            JACINDA
                  You motherfucker!

     She grabs a lamp, still plugged in, and swings it at Seth.
     She hits him square in the chest and the light bulb explodes!

     She charges at him again, arms flailing. Seth scurries around
     the room, shielding the blows with the detergent bottles.

     Evan throws the Enormous Guy to the ground and runs. Evan
     backs off, spots Seth, and follows him out of the party.

     The cops and Fogell stand beside the car. The Homeless Guy is
     sleeping in the back. Michaels has his gun drawn and is
     carefully aiming at a distant stop sign.

               You can do it, officer.

     BLAM!!! Michaels blasts off a round, which punches a hole
     right through the center of the "O" in the stop sign.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               Boo-yaka-sha!!! Suck it, Slater. Suck my
               nuts. Long, but gentle.

               Yeah. Sure. Here. Go nuts.

     Slater hands Fogell the gun, when suddenly a SIREN can be

     Slater grabs the gun out of the disappointed Fogell's hand
     and holsters it. They all hop into the car.

     Seth and Evan are running down the sidewalk. They both slow

                  No I didn't!

                  Of course you did! We were supposed to do
                  something and you left instead of doing
                  it! That's the definition of bailing!

                            EVAN
                  If you said we should burn our dicks off
                  and I didn't, that's not bailing!

                            SETH
                  It is bailing, if you promised to burn

                  The bottom line is   you're a bailer. You
                  just bailed on me,   you bailed on me this
                  morning when Terry   spat on me, and you're
                  bailing on me next   year!

                  Oh! Okay! There it is! It finally comes

                  We were supposed to go to college
                  together! Since elementary school! What
                  ever happened to that!

                            EVAN
                  What happened to that, is that you're too
                  stupid to get into the schools I did!

                            SETH
                  I was not too stupid, I was too lazy!

                  You've wasted all my time, you selfish
                  bastard!!! Instead of chasing girls and
                  making friends, I threw away the last
                  three years talking bullshit with you!
                  And now, because of you, I'm going to
                  college a fucking friendless virgin!

     Seth can't believe it. He's extremely hurt.

     Michaels pounds on the keypad of the little cop computer with

               How do they expect us to work these

               work my iMac while I'm sitting at my
               desk.

                         FOGELL
               So, like, what does that computer do?

                         OFFICER SLATER
               Pretty much anything, if you're smart
               enough to figure it out. Like, who do you
               really hate? Gimme a name.

                         OFFICER MICHAELS
               Can I do it?

     Slater nods. Michaels bring her file up, then punches a few
     buttons and smiles.

      HIT by the COP CAR!!! Seth flies up onto the hood, SMASHING
      the windshield. The car screeches to a halt and Seth slides
      off the front of the car.

                             OFFICER MICHEALS (CONT'D)
                   Listen McLovin, you... like... Officer
                   Slater and myself, don't you?

      Fogell tries to light his cigarette. It takes a few tries and
      he starts hacking after the first pull.

                             FOGELL
                       (coughing)
                   Umm, yeah, sure. You guys are great.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   Yeah, well, we're also on probation. You
                   see, we've actually trashed two other
                   cars. The first time wasn't our fault,
                   and the second time a bee flew in and I
                   freaked out. Point is, we trash another
                   car, without a good reason, we're fucked.
                   Know what I'm saying?

      Fogell continues to painfully suck back on the cigarette.

                             FOGELL
                   Sure.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   Now, we're going to arrest these guys,
                   and if you don't mind, which you
                   shouldn't, we'd like you to write a fake
                   witness report saying they jumped out in
                   front of our car. Cool, McLovin?

      Fogell nods his head, getting some of his cigarette smoke in
      his eyes. He winces and starts to blink in discomfort.

      Slater stands above the boys.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   How tall are you?

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   And you said those were "Pumas?"

      Seth nods. Officer Michaels and Fogell get out of the car.
      Seth and Evan see Fogell and stare in shock as he takes a
      drag of a cigarette and then flicks it aside.

      Michaels pulls Slater aside and mumbles into his ear. Fogell
      turns and sees Seth and Evan - he's completely dumbfounded!

      Evan starts to look really nervous, like he might literally
      explode. He starts to stand up.

      The cops are still talking when suddenly, Evan BOLTS!

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   Shit!

      The cops run after Evan! Seth and Fogell look at each other.
      Seth grabs the remaining detergent jug and runs off in the
      opposite direction of Evan! Fogell reaches into the cop car,
      grabs the bags of booze, and follows Seth.

                             FOGELL
                   Seth! Wait up!

      Officer Slater looks back to see Seth and Fogell running.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   Shit! Shit! McLovin bailed!

      The cops run back into their car.

      They can't see out of the shattered windshield.

      The cops get out of the car and   run off after Seth and
      Fogell. As they run, we see the   Homeless Guy slump out of the
      car, landing on his face with a   muffled groan. He stands up,
      grabs the jug of detergent that   was left on the ground, and
      runs off.

      Fogell and an exhausted Seth are running together. Seth grabs
      Fogell and takes him around a house and towards a backyard. A
      second later, the cops run by the house and continue up the
      block.

      Seth and Fogell sprint across a big, dark backyard. Seth

      He runs smack into a little red tent and trips onto it! KIDS
      inside the tent start screaming as flashlights turn on.

                             KIDS
                       (hysterical)
                   Help/ It's a monster!/ Daddy!

      Fogell helps Seth get up. They try to run, but Seth is caught
      on the tent! He drags it a couple feet as the kids start
      clawing to get out.

                             KIDS (CONT'D)
                   AAAHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!

      The zipper opens and a KID hops out. The Kid looks at Seth.

                             KID
                   AHHH!!! NO!!! DADDY!!!!

                   Holy shit! Little kids!!!

      A little GIRL runs out and books it into the house. From
      inside the tent, another kid starts kicking at Seth.

                             SETH
                   Ow!

      Seth manages to free himself from the tent and he and Fogell
      fall to the ground. The kids continue to scream.

                             FATHER(O.S.)
                   Get away from my children!

      The guys turn and see a crazed, slightly overweight FATHER in
      his underwear running at them with a baseball bat. Fogell and
      Seth scramble to their feet as the Dad takes a swing at them,
      narrowly missing them.

                             FATHER(CONT'D)
                   You sick sons-of-bitches!

      Fogell throws his shoulder into the guy, knocking him down.
      Seth and Fogell run to the backyard gate and try to open it.
      They can't.

                             FOGELL
                   Help!

      Fogell starts banging as Seth looks back to see the Dad
      coming for them. Seth swings the detergent jug at the Father,
      knocking him on his ass. He quickly gets up and charges,
      enraged.

      Fogell gets the door open and the two boys run into the
      alley.

      They sprint down the alley. Seth coughs and wheezes, slowing
      down as he lugs the detergent. The Father enters the alley
      and sees the boys running. He throws his baseball bat. It
      sails through the air and nails Seth in the back! He falls.

      Evan is nestled inside a large bush, frantically trying to
      reverse his clothes so as to disguise himself. He keeps
      looking out for the cops, when suddenly he hears a gunshot -
      BLAM!!!

      As he fumbles to turn his jacket inside out and get it on, he
      sees Seth and Fogell running towards him. He pops out of the
      bush, scaring Fogell and Seth.

      They turn a corner at the end of the block and continue
      running.

      They turn onto a main street and are exuberant at the sight
      of an oncoming bus. It stops at a nearby stop. They haul ass

      Out of breath, the boys dig up change and put it in the toll
      box, then walk towards the back of the bus.

      Fogell looks up and sees the Homeless Guy stumbling towards
      them, sucking back the bottom of the lost detergent bottle.
      The Homeless Guy sees they have bags full of booze.

                             HOMELESS GUY (CONT'D)

      The Homeless Nutcase reaches for the booze. Seth steps in
      front of him.

                   Give me the booze!

      The guy shoves Seth aside and dives at Fogell.

      WE GO INTO VERY SLOW MOTION:

      - Helen's bottle of Goldschlager gets knocked from the bag.
      It VERY SLOWLY falls towards the ground.

      - Seth reaches for it, but doesn't quite grab it.

      - WE LOUDLY HEAR the bottle as it slams against the bus
      floor...but doesn't break! It slowly rises back up into the
      air and begins sailing towards the front of the bus.

      - Evan LEAPS through the air, sailing towards the precious
      Goldschlager with his arms extended.

                             EVAN
                       (in slo-mo voice)

      - He is inches away from grabbing it, when it suddenly
      smashes into a pole, SHATTERING, sending little gold flakes
      everywhere.

      BACK TO NORMAL.

      The Homeless Guy sees the gold flakes.

                             HOMELESS GUY
                   Shit!!! Gold!!!

      He starts frantically picking up the flakes as Evan stares at
      the remains, shocked. Fogell walks over.

                Shut up, Fogell. Never mind. Evan'll tell
                you next year.

                   Save that shit for later. We've got shit
                   to do.

      Seth just goes into the house with the booze, leaving Fogell
      and Evan.

                             FOGELL
                   We never should have had to hide our

      Everyone starts cheering! Seth sets it out on the kitchen
      table; it is an impressive array of inebriates.

                          SETH

      In the background, we see Evan and Fogell wander into the
      party as Jules approaches Seth.

                          JULES
                This is awesome. Thank you so much.

                          SETH

                          JULES
                Yeah. To be honest, people were starting
                to get seriously pissed off. Listen, I've
                got to go tell everyone the drinks are
                here. Don't go anywhere. Promise?

                          SETH

      Jules walks off.

      Tons of kids pour themselves drinks. Seth and about six other

      refills everyone's shot glasses.

      Evan walks out onto the back porch, looking for Helen. He
      sees Becca.

                             EVAN
                   Becca! Hey.

                             BECCA
                   Where have you been, you almost blew it.

                              EVAN
                   What?

                             BECCA
                   Helen. She's been waiting for you. She's
                   right over there. She's been yammering
                   about you all night.

                             EVAN
                   What? What did she say? Does she think
                   I'm a good guy? What did she say?

                             BECCA
                   It was something like, "I'll fully blow
                   him tonight."

                              EVAN
                   What?!?

      Evan looks over and sees Helen standing on the balcony with a
      big group of people. He gets really nervous.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Oh man. This is too much. Oh god. What do
                   I do? I lost the Goldschlager I was
                   supposed to bring her!

                   Well, Jordana stole a bottle of tequila
                   from her parents and her and Helen have
                   been going at it. I think she'll be fine
                   in that department. I'd just go over
                   there and invite her upstairs, pronto.

                             EVAN
                   What? Oh man...
                       (so nervous)
                   But...she's totally hammered. If I get
                   with her, and I'm not drunk, isn't that,
                   like, date rape?

                             BECCA
                   It's not date rape if you're drunk, too.

                              EVAN
                   I guess.

      Evan looks at Helen and takes a deep breath.

      Evan enters the bathroom and slams the door shut, a bottle of
      Ouzo in one hand and a beer in the other. He looks at himself
      in the mirror, seeming as though he's on the verge of a full-
      on panic attack.

                             EVAN
                       (panting)
                   Calm down, Evan. She likes you. She wants
                   to suck on your penis. That's a good
                   thing.

      He opens the Ouzo and smells it, recoiling in disgust.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Down the hatch.

      Evan takes a mighty swig, then gags and spits it out,
      spraying it everywhere.

      Fogell sits bored in front of the TV, drinking a beer. He
      watches a bunch of girls flirt with some boys. Everyone is
      talking and laughing while he sits alone.

      He walks over to the doorway of a room filled with girls
      dancing. In the corner dancing is Nicola. He stares at her
      for a moment, then goes back and sits in front of the TV.

      He changes the channel and "COPS" comes on the screen. It
      shows two cops chasing a crack head, tackling him and knee
      dropping him. Fogell ponders as he watches "COPS." He throws
      back the rest of his beer and marches into the room Nicola is
      dancing in.

      He walks up to Nicola, who is by far the best-looking girl in
      the room, and starts dancing with her. She looks a bit thrown
      at first, but after a few beats, she seems to like it.

                             FOGELL
                   They call you Nicola, right?

      - Evan, who has drank about half the bottle and is pretty
      drunk, stands up, arms reached out, and tries to walk in a
      straight line. He does it fairly well. Frustrated, he sits
      back down and takes another disgusting swig of Ouzo.

      - Evan can't keep his balance as he tries to touch his nose
      while standing on one foot. He's drunk. He drinks from the
      tap thirstily, eats some toothpaste, fixes his collar and
      hair, and then gathers his courage, takes a deep breath, and
      steps out of the bathroom.

      Evan walks out on the balcony. He spots the circle of people
      Helen was standing in, only now Helen is laying on the
      ground, laughing hysterically. Everyone in the circle is
      looking at her and laughing as well. Evan is extremely
      nervous. Helen looks up and spots him.

                Help me up! None of these people will
                help me up!

      Evan notices that she seems a little drunk. He helps her up
      and she collapses onto him, forcing him to hold her up.

                          EVAN
                Hey, Helen. Sorry I was-

      Helen laughs hysterically as she latches onto Evan. He smells
      her breath. It reeks of alcohol.

      Evan's drunk, but Helen is completely fucking shit-faced!

                           HELEN

      Helen picks up a bottle of tequila and shoves it into Evan's
      hand.

                             HELEN
                   Here! Don't worry, we can drink this.

                             EVAN
                   I'm already pretty wasted.
                   But...uh...here's to you.

      Evan takes a much-unwanted drink and gags.

                             HELEN
                   Light-weight!

      Everyone laughs.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   Hey...me and you should go upstairs now.
                   I really want to...tell you something.

                             EVAN
                       (confused and drunk)
                   Uh...uh...uh...you could just tell me
                   right here-

                             HELEN
                       (laughing)
                   No! Let's go upstairs, come on!

      Evan hears everyone giggle as Helen pulls him towards the
      house. Helen trips, just managing not to fall.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                Careful...

      Nicola and Fogell are standing in the corner of the room.
      Nicola is looking at Fogell's ID.

                           NICOLA
                McLovin! That's the funniest thing I've

                          FOGELL
                Yeah, I just thought it sounded old.

      They both laugh and their eyes meet.

      The party is in full swing and everyone is getting good and
      drunk. Jules walks up to Seth, who is clearly piss drunk.

                          JULES
                Hey, I'm back. I had to thank the peeps
                for comin' out.

                          SETH
                    (really, really, drunk)
                Jules! The hostess with the most-est! The
                woman of the hour!

      Seth takes a swig of a beer.

                          SETH (CONT'D)
                This party's blowin' my ass off! I want
                you to have a drink with me.

      Seth offers her a beer.

                          JULES
                No, thanks. I'm good. But, seriously,
                thanks for getting all the drinks. It
                really made the night.

                          SETH
                It's just how I roll, Jules. No problems,
                no problems.

      Jules laughs and Seth sees that his charm is working.

                   conversing with you, you're so good at
                   it, but I can't hear you. Could we just
                   go on the...uh...balcony or something?

      Jules eyes Seth suspiciously. Seth just looks at her, smiling
      drunkenly.

                             JULES
                   Why not? I haven't conversed in ages.
                   Let's do it.

      Jules walks out of the kitchen. He finishes off his beer and
      then, happy as shit, drunkenly dances out of the kitchen and
      after Jules.

      Evan practically holds Helen up, almost dropping her several
      times, as they stumble into Jules' bedroom. Helen puts down
      the tequila and starts kissing Evan, but it's not nice
      kissing, it's sloppy porno kissing with way too much tongue.
      After a few moments Evan pulls away and looks at the
      remarkably drunk Helen.

                             EVAN
                   Are you okay?

                             HELEN
                   I so flirt with you in Math.

                             EVAN
                   Oh man. Helen...I want to tell you, I
                   mean, I've wanted to tell you, for a long
                   time-

                             HELEN
                   I know. I've wanted to get with you so
                   hard.

      Helen kisses him.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   Like...so hard.

      Helen yanks him onto the bed and starts sloppily kissing him
      again. Evan doesn't know what to do. She tries to take off
      Evan's shirt, but is way too inebriated to undo the buttons.
      Evan yanks it off.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   Good...

      Helen stands up and starts to waver back and forth. She looks
      like she's about to tip over, but she catches herself and
      sloppily tries to strike a sexy pose like a model.

      Evan watches in dread as she starts to strip, pulling her
      shirt over her head, completely failing to look sexual.

      As Evan watches the tragedy unfold, he grabs the bottle of
      tequila and takes a big swig. Helen sits on the floor and
      concentrates on untying her shoes.

                             HELEN (CONT'D)
                   What the fuck...stupid shoe...

      Evan moves over to help her. He can't do it either.

                             EVAN
                   Shit. Can you, like, slip out?

      Helen tries to squeeze her feet out, but she can't. She grabs
      a pair of scissors off a desk.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   Whoa. Fuckin'...careful.

      She snips off the knot and slips her shoe off.

                             HELEN
                   You...take off your pants...
                       (drunkenly waving the scissors)
                   Or I'll cut `em off.

      Helen laughs as she staggers to her feet and start kissing
      Evan. He starts taking off his pants.

                             NICOLA
                   I don't know. You're like, the most
                   mysterious guy in the grade. Like, nobody
                   knows anything about you.

                             FOGELL
                   Well, you're about to learn a few things.

      Jules and Seth step out onto the front porch. There is no one
      else out there. The moment the door closes behind them, Seth
      turns to Jules and puts his hands on her hips. He stares into
      her eyes and moves in for the kiss.

      Jules instantly pulls back.

                          JULES
                Whoa! Whoa! Slow down.

                          SETH
                What? What's wrong?

                          JULES
                I'd...uh...prefer if we did this at some
                other time.

                Well, you're drunk. Like, really, really
                drunk.

                So? So are you.

                          JULES
                I'm not drunk at all. I don't even drink.

      Seth is absolutely shocked. It takes his remarkably drunk
      mind a moment to process this information.

                          SETH
                You don't drink? But...but, you told me
                to get the liquor!

      Evan sitting on the bed in only his boxers, and Helen is just
      getting her pants off, leaving her only in her lingerie.
      Evan's eyes widen. She looks at Evan and rubs her breasts in
      a very un-sexy way.

                          HELEN
                I wore this for you. Here we go...

      Helen crawls onto the bed, pushes Evan down, and starts
      seriously making out with him, drunker and sloppier than
      ever.

                   Yeah I do, I want to fuck you.

                   Look, you know I really like you, Helen,
                   but this is...it's just too intense. And
                   I'm so drunk I don't even know how to,

      Fogell is laying on his back on the bed and Nicola is
      straddling him. They are kissing. Nicola sits up and takes
      Fogell's hand and starts sucking his fingers.

      He pulls a condom out.

      Seth and Jules are both seated on the stairs. Seth has his
      face in his hands. Jules is patting him on the back, but
      clearly feels awkward.

                Seth, you...uh...

      Seth looks up at her, drunk as hell, his eyes half-open.

                AAAHHH!

      Jules clutches her eye as Seth slumps onto the patio floor,
      unconscious. She gets up, yelling in pain, as Seth opens his
      eyes.

                          JULES (CONT'D)

      Jules storms into the house, leaving Seth lying on the front
      porch. He wiggles around a bit.

                   ...sorry...

      Seth passes out again. A few moments go by, when SUDDENLY a
      cop car pulls up in front of the house. Seth opens his eyes
      and sees the cops.

                                SETH (CONT'D)
                   Oh no.

      Two cops get out and start harassing two kids smoking a joint
      on the front lawn. One of them turns on their flashlight and

      Evan, sitting on the couch next to Miroki (Evan's partner
      from cooking class), drinking a bottle of tequila. He's
      absolutely smashed.

                             EVAN
                   Life's bullshit, huh, Miroki?

      Suddenly, Seth bursts into the room and grabs Evan's shirt.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)

      Seth grabs Evan's wrists and tries to pull him to his feet.

                   Fuck off, jerk! You're hurting my

      KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! The loud authoritative knocking echoes
      through the party and everyone looks to the door, knowing it
      can only mean one thing. Someone opens the door, revealing
      Officer Slater and Officer Michaels! They talk to whoever
      answered the door, oblivious of Evan and Seth.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   We had a complaint about the noise. It
                   looks like you're having a nice little
                   party here.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS

      Evan points at the cops.

                   That's what I've been...! Here...

      Seth pulls Evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out
      of the living room just as the cops step into it.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   Okay, everyone out. Party's over. Get out
                   of here.

      Michaels turns to Slater.

                   I'll go upstairs. I told you this would

      Seth and Evan sit at the back of the empty bus together.

                             EVAN
                   Is the bang bus anything like this?

      Seth cracks up laughing.

      The cop car is spinning donuts in the middle of the empty
      lot. It stops. Fogell and Officer Michaels get out, both
      smiling. The driver side window rolls down, reveal Slater.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   Alright, boys. What I'm about to show you
                   is pretty much the greatest move in donut-
                   spinning history. Behold: the reverse
                   figure-eight.

      Slater drives to the other side of the lot.

                             FOGELL
                   So, like, what's your official position?

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   If you were in, you were in. You are no
                   longer a virgin, end of story. Screw
                   cumming.

      Suddenly, Slater guns it and speeds across the lot, slamming
      the breaks, spinning wildly in several erratic donuts
      backward donuts.

      Slater completely loses control of the car. He smashes
      through a bunch of shopping carts and slams into a light
      post, completely fucking up the cruiser.

      Slater tries to open his door, but it won't budge. He crawls
      out the missing windshield, slumping onto the ground.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   Alright. I think that's all the fun we're
                   gettin' out of this one.

      Slater hands Fogell his note pad.

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   ...and by signing this you are officially
                   saying that as we stopped you from being
                   mugged, a crack-head stole our cruiser
                   and did God knows what with it.

                             FOGELL
                   Of course. That mugger had nothing but
                   murder in his eyes. I owe you my life.

      Fogell signs the pad.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   Can we do this already?

      The cops and Fogell push the cruiser towards a small, but
      steep, hill. They shove it over the edge and watch it roll.
      It gains speed and smashes into a tree, shattering the
      windows and crushing the front of the car.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS (CONT'D)
                   Can we shoot at it?

                             OFFICER SLATER
                   I don't know, can you?

      They whip out their guns.

                             OFFICER SLATER (CONT'D)
                   I'm throwin' down the gauntlet. 50 bucks.
                   Whoever hits the gas tank.

                             OFFICER MICHAELS
                   You are so fucking on.

                             FOGELL
                   Can I get a shot?

      Slater hands Fogell his gun. With a huge smile, Fogell raises
      the gun, aims it at the police cruiser, and BLASTS off round
      after round.

      Seth and Evan are lying in sleeping bags beside one another.
      The now empty bottle of Tequila lies between them. They are
      laughing very hard, still drunk off their asses.

                             SETH
                   I can't believe she said that shit.

      They laugh harder.

                             EVAN (CONT'D)
                   And then you saved me, man! I fucking
                   love you!

                   I fucking love you, too, man! I'm not

                             EVAN
                   Why don't we say that more? It feels
                   good! I love you more than my brother,
                   man. Like, when you went away for Easter
                   last year, I, like, missed you. You know?

                             SETH
                   I missed you, too. Come here, man.

      Seth grabs Evan and they hug.

                             SETH (CONT'D)
                   We'll always be friends. `Cause we love
                   each other.

      They stop hugging and sit back down. They're laughter slows
      down and there is a moment of silence.

                             SETH (CONT'D)
                   Like, three weeks ago I was in you room
                   and, like, you were taking a dump and...I
                   saw your residence placement thingy. I
                   totally saw you're living with Fogell.
                   So, like-

                             EVAN
                   I'm sorry, man.

                             SETH
                   Don't be! Don't be! I'm sorry. I was
                   being a bitch.

                              EVAN
                   I need you to know that it's not like I
                   even want to live with Fogell; it's just
                   that I'm really afraid of living with
                   strangers.

      There is a moment of silence.

                          EVAN
                Yeah, me too. Like, yeah...at least we
                kind of came together, again.

      Evan wakes up and looks over at Seth, who is also waking.
      They look at each other extremely awkwardly, almost as though
      they drunkenly had sex with each other last night.

                          EVAN
                Oh...uh...hey. Morning.

                          SETH

                          EVAN
                Um...

      Seth looks at his watch.

                          SETH
                Maybe I should get going.

                          EVAN
                You don't have to. I'm not, like, doing
                anything.

      Evan is standing in the pants section of a department store.
      Seth walks out of the dressing room wearing jeans that are
      way too small.

                             EVAN
                   Don't ask me. I don't give a shit if your
                   pants look good.

                             SETH
                   Well, I need someone's opinion.

                             EVAN
                   Fine. They're way too small.

                             SETH
                   Yeah, but when I was wearing your dad's
                   pants last night I realized that if I buy
                   pants that are too small it'll encourage
                   me to lose weight. And in tight pants
                   chicks'll kind of see my dick a little.

                             EVAN
                   Yeah, the male camel toe look is really
                   big this year.

      Seth goes back into the dressing room and wriggles out of the
      pants. He walks out.

                             SETH
                   These pants suck. Let's the get the fuck

                   Again, I'm so sorry. I can't believe I
                   actually did that.

                   I feel sorry that I'm making you buy me a

                   Is that them?

      They stare at the two girls from afar.

                             EVAN
                   Should we hide?

      Helen looks and notices them. She waves and points them out
      to Jules. Seth and Evan wave back. The girls get up and start
      to walk over.

                   Helen called me a pussy to my face! What
                   am I going to say to her?

      The girls walk up to them.

                  HELEN                                JULES
      Hi Evan, Seth.                       Hey guys.

                Not really. I remember looking up, and
                you screaming at me. That's about it.

      Jules laughs.

                    (to Evan)
                I didn't puke on you, did I?

      Evan laughs.

                No, I dodged it. Whizzed right by me.

                Thanks for being such a gentleman.

      There is a moment of silence.

                          SETH
                You look good with a black eye.

      They all chuckle a little.

                Thanks, smart guy. That's why I'm here. I
                have to go to Macy's to get a shitload of
                cover-up for the grad photo.

                    (flirtatiously, joking)
                So, you gonna come with me to Macy's and

                           SETH
                Yes! Definitely. I'd love to. I had such
                bad acne last year, I became an expert on
                the stuff.

      Jules pulls Seth away. Evan and Helen start walking in the
      opposite direction.

      As they walk away from one another, Seth and Evan look back
      and give each other a small and yet emotionally-charged wave.
      A SLOW, GUT WRENCHING SOUL SONG STARTS TO PLAY. They look as

          Darkness. The sound of a radio and pots and pans clanging
          fades in. Caden, 40, opens his eyes in bed, and groggily
          looks at himself in the bureau mirror. The bedside clock
          reads 7:45.

          1 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - SAME1

          Adele, 40, in t-shirt and sweats, mixes a bowl of instant
          oatmeal, puts it in the microwave.

          Adele leaves the kitchen. Caden, also 40, enters as she's
          leaving. He's dressed in a ratty terrycloth robe.

          CADENADELE
          Morning. Morning. Tried not to wake
          you.

          Olive, 4, sits on the toilet. Adele enters, rips some toilet
          paper off the roll and proceeds to wipe Olive. The phone
          rings in the kitchen.

          ADELECADEN (O.S.)
          Caden, could you get that? It's Maria. I don't want to.

          ADELE
          Ugh. Caden!
          (looks at bright green
          smear on toilet paper)
          That's weird.
          The phone stops ringing.

          A cellphone rings in the other room.

          going to be fine.

          She rifles through her purse, grabs her cellphone, answers.

          Hey.

          (LAUGHING)
          Oh, wiping Olive's ass. You?
          Caden is pouring himself a cup of coffee. He sips it and
          stares out the window. It's raining.

          ADELE (CONT'D)
          You're kidding! Holy fuck!
          Caden exits with his coffee, annoyed about the phone call.

          CADEN
          I don't feel well.

          4 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - FALL 2005 - CONTINUOUS 4

          Caden passes the bathroom. Olive is staring into the toilet
          bowl. Adele can be heard chatting in the background.

          OLIVE
          Daddy, my poop is green.
          Caden enters the bathroom, looks into the bowl at the green
          feces and smeared toilet paper. He seems freaked out.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          Am I going to be okay?

          Is poop alive?

          5EXT. CADEN AND ADELE'S HOUSE - FALL 2005 - MORNING 5

          Caden steps out the front door in his bare feet and hurries
          down the driveway in the rain. He picks up the newspaper,
          pulls the mail from the box. As he heads back inside, he
          flips through the mail. There's a magazine called Attending
          to your Illness addressed to Caden. A diseased person on the
          cover. Across the street a gaunt man watches Caden, unseen.

          6INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S KITCHEN - FALL 2005 - MORNING 6

          Caden sits at the kitchen table with his coffee, reading the
          paper, dated Friday, October 14, 2005.

          ADELE
          All right, baby. See you then.
          Adele clicks off her cellphone.

          oatmeal. This isn't a

          like an invisible virus of thought.
          The sheep nods. Caden pours himself some more coffee, opens
          the milk carton to pour some in, then sniffs at the spout.
          He checks the date on the carton. It's October 20.

          Caden goes back to his paper. Adele puts a peanut butter

          Caden is in the dentist's chair, a bloody bib around his
          neck. The dentist, in surgical mask, probes his open mouth,
          calls out numbers to an assistant, who records them.

          Caden shaves. A faucet explodes and smacks him in the
          forehead. He is sent staggering backwards with a yelp, into
          the far wall, his razor flying and blood pouring from a
          jagged cut above his right eyebrow. Off-screen, we hear the
          pounding footsteps of someone running toward us. Half of
          Caden's face is covered with shaving cream. Rivulets of
          blood intermingle with it. Water shoots out where the tap
          was, spraying the mirror, which is spattered with blood.
          Adele, dressed in heavily paint-splattered clothes, hurries
          in and takes in the scene: the wet, the mess, the blood.

          Olive, in a nightgown, stands quietly in the doorway, her

          Um. I was shaving and -- My God! Jesus! Look at your

          Caden sits on the toilet, presses a towel to his head. Adele
          squats, goes into a spasmodic coughing fit, finishes, opens
          the cabinet under the sink, pushes her arm through bottles of
          cleaning products, old sponges, old toothbrushes, toilet
          paper rolls and other junk to the shut-off valves.

          He looks at Caden's eyes, turns off the bright lamp and looks
          again. He turns the lamp back on and looks once more.

          CADEN
          What?
          The doctor feels Caden's pulse, then listens to his heart.
          He presses hard against the glands in Caden's neck.

          DOCTOR
          Changes in bowel movements?

          CADEN
          A little more yellow than usual.
          What?

          DOCTOR
          I'd like you to see an
          ophthalmologist.

          DOCTOR
          What? No, an ophthalmologist. I
          said, ophthalmologist.

          CADEN
          Oh.
          The doctor stares blankly at Caden for a long moment, then
          looks suspiciously in Caden's ears.

          10INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S CAR - WINTER 2006 - NIGHT 10

          Adele drives and coughs spasmodically. The car swerves a bit.
          Caden has a bandaged head and a prescription in his hand.
          Olive, in her car seat, sings. Caden sees revelers in winter
          coats and party hats outside a house. They blow noisemakers
          and yell "happy new year!"

          OLIVE

          (SINGING)
          It's a beautiful day and the sun is
          shining and yellow. And the world
          is too big to understand and today
          is Tuesday and --

          OLIVE

          And today is Friday and...
          Olive's singing continues but goes under.

          ADELE
          So what exactly did he say?

          It's okay. They just carry water

          Could be. But I think we need to

          A neurologist?

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          Yes, a brain expert.

          CADEN OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          I know what a neurologist is. Fine. I just thought from
          the way you asked --

          I thought maybe you said urologist.
          Why do I need to see a neurologist?

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          For a look-see. The eyes are part
          of the brain, after all.

          CADEN
          That's not true, is it?

          OPHTHALMOLOGIST
          Why would I say it if it weren't
          true?

          It just doesn't seem right.

          Caden sits in the almost empty theater. A few people with
          note-pads are scattered around. Centerstage, a 1948 Dodge
          Business Coupe. The car is surrounded by various rooms from
          that period: a kitchen, bedrooms, etc.

          Tom, the actor playing Willy Loman, stands center stage.
          Claire, the actress playing Linda Loman, sits in the set's
          bedroom. Davis, the actor playing Biff, lies on the top bunk
          of a bunk bed upstage. A fourth actor, playing Happy, lies on
          the bottom bunk.

          Tom starts the car and guns the engine. A brick wall off
          stage speeds into the car, accompanied by crashing and
          screeching sound effects.

          Caden meets Tom at the foot of the stage. Behind them a

          set it. Claire primps in the bureau mirror.

          person playing Willy Loman thinks
          he's only pretending to be at the
          end of a life full of despair. But
          the tragedy is that we know that
          you, the young actor, will end up

          ADELE
          Um... I don't know. Hopeful or
          something. Like something was
          going to change.

          MADELINE
          Something did, no?

          ADELE CADEN
          Yes, of course. Yes. I mean... big time.

          ADELE
          Maybe not as much as I had hoped.
          That's a terrible thing to say.

          MADELINE
          There are no terrible things to say
          in here. Only true and false.

          ADELE
          I feel alone sometimes. I feel
          exhausted. Can I say something
          awful?

          MADELINE
          Yes. Please do.

          ADELE
          I've fantasized about Caden dying
          and being able to start again.
          Guilt free. I know it's terrible.

          19EXT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - 2006 - DAY 19

          Caden sits sadly on the steps; drinks coffee. He watches as
          Hazel pulls into the parking lot, gets out of her car. The
          gaunt man is behind the trash bin. She sits next to Caden.

          CADEN
          It's a nightmare in there.

          HAZEL
          The car crash?

          CADEN
          Well... not only.

          HAZEL
          Sorry. So I'm reading The Trial.

          HAZEL
          Love. I'm such an idiot for not
          knowing about this book.
          (conspiratorial whisper)
          It's famous, it turns out.

          CADEN
          You're not an idiot.
          Pause.

          HAZEL
          Then you say, in fact, you're very
          bright, Hazel. And I love your
          eyes.

          CADENHAZEL
          In fact, you're very bright, (playing charmed)
          Hazel. And I love your eyes. Oh, am I? Oh, do you? Oh,
          darling!

          CADEN
          Then what do I say?

          HAZEL
          I can't say what then you say.

          CADEN
          Why?

          HAZEL
          Cause it's dirty.
          A whistling noise turns their heads. In the distance a man
          with an unopened parachute is plummeting.

          HAZEL (CONT'D)
          Oh my God! Jesus!
          They watch as the man falls behind a building. A scream. A
          screech of brakes.

          HAZEL (CONT'D)
          He's gotta be dead. Right?

          20 INT. CADEN AND ADELE'S BATHROOM - 2006 - DAY20

          Caden enters. The plumber is working on the sink.

          PLUMBER

          21 INT. ADELE'S STUDIO - 2006 - DAY21

          The studio is a mess, the floor covered with paint. Adele,
          in her paint-spattered clothing, works on a tiny canvas, an
          inch square. She paints with a single-hair brush while
          looking through a magnifying glass. Caden pokes his head in.

          CADEN
          Can I piss in your sink?

          ADELE
          Um, yeah, I guess.
          Caden pisses in the sink in the corner of the studio. His
          urine is amber. He finishes and peeks over Adele's shoulder,
          through the magnifying glass at the painting. It's an
          amazingly detailed and angrily colored painting of a woman in
          a state of profound despair, screaming to the heavens, while
          standing in a field of flames.

          CADEN
          It's gorgeous, Ad.

          ADELE
          Thanks. How was rehearsal?

          CADEN
          Awful. We have five hundred and
          sixty lighting cues. I don't know
          why I made it so complicated.

          ADELE
          It's what you do.

          CADEN
          Yeah. Anyway, we got through it.
          I think you'll be impressed.

          ADELE
          Caden, listen, I'm really sorry. I
          just can't go tonight.
          (off his look)
          I'm sorry. I've got to get two
          canvases ready to ship. By
          tomorrow. I know it sucks.

          CADENADELE
          But it's opening night.I know. I'm sorry. I would

          22INT. SCHENECTADY THEATER - 2006 - NIGHT 22

          The theater is full. Caden stands nervously in the back.
          The lights dim. Hazel looks back from her seat at Caden and
          mouths the word "yay." He smiles. The curtain rises on a
          dark stage. Tom, as Willy, gets out of the car parked center
          stage and walks into the kitchen.

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          Oh boy, oh boy.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Willy!

          Why? What happened?

          (PAUSE)
          Did something happen, Willy?

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          No, nothing happened.

          You didn't smash the car, did you?

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          I said nothing happened. Didn't you
          hear me?

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Don't you feel well?

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          I'm tired to death. I couldn't make
          it. I just couldn't make it, Linda.

          CLAIRE (AS LINDA)
          Where were you all day? You look
          terrible.

          TOM (AS WILLY)
          I got as far as a little above
          Yonkers. I stopped for a cup of
          coffee... maybe it was the coffee.

          The audience is rapt. Caden relaxes.

          The cast party is in full swing. The opening was a success.
          Lots of drinking. Caden chats with Claire. Hazel watches
          from across the room.

          CLAIRE
          (scrunching her nose)
          Ugh, I hated myself tonight. Plus

          She gets teary, gives him a kiss on the cheek.

          God, I'm such a baby.
          She just looks at him and smiles and nods.

          She backs away and gets lost in the crowd. Caden massages
          his temples. Suddenly Hazel is next to him.

          lolling. She bends down to pet it.

          watches herself blankly in the mirror, somewhat erased
          without eye make-up. The run-over dog is sleeping in a box
          on the floor.

          head, sleepily drunk, against his shoulder. Caden studies a
          series of lumps under the skin of his arm.

          on a street of neat little houses. Faint swirls of smoke
          escape from the windows. She rings the doorbell. The button
          is hot; Hazel pulls her finger away.

          Maria came over to keep me company
          and we lost track. I'm sorry I
          missed the play. But I got
          everything done here. How'd it go?

          We're a hit. Reviews are great.

          brilliant to cast young actors as
          Willy and Linda.

          OLIVE
          What's wrong with your face, Daddy?

          CADEN
          It's pustules. It's called
          sycosis. Spelled differently than
          psychosis, but it sounds the same.

          OLIVE
          I don't know what that means.

          eat rats ... Me who am as a raw nerve ... Crease.

          Caden finds a website online for Madeline Gravis. Amazing

          in the world, a sought-after public speaker, advisor to world
          leaders. Her book Getting Better has sold millions of
          copies and is translated into fifteen languages. In a box
          at the bottom is a photo of a smiling Caden; it reads:

          I'm going to recommend a

          Adele feeds a piece of paper into a fax machine.
          A fax starts to come in. Caden watches as the words appear,
          fuzzy as if there is some interference in the process.
          Olive wanted me to ask you not to read her diary. She left
          it under her pillow by mistake. Glglf n mesr-siy. Hewz wec.

          Caden lifts the bed pillow and finds a kid's diary. He
          studies it, puts it back. There's a knock at the front door.

          Caden paces nervously. He sits on Olive's bed and jimmies
          open her diary with a screwdriver. He reads:

          Caden sits with Hazel. She seems somewhat distant.

          CADEN
          The idea is to do a massive theater
          piece. Uncompromising, honest. I
          don't know what it is yet or how to
          do it, but it'll come. It'll
          reveal itself.

          HAZEL
          Huh.
          Pause.

          CADEN
          HereÃ¢â¬â¢s what I think theater is:
          itÃ¢â¬â¢s the beginning of thought. The
          truth not yet spoken. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a
          blackbird in winter. The moment
          before death. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s what a man
          feels after heÃ¢â¬â¢s been clocked in
          the jaw. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s love... in all its
          messiness. And I want all of us,
          players and audience alike, to soak
          in the communal bath of it, the
          mikvah, as the Jews call it. WeÃ¢â¬â¢re
          all in the same water, after all,
          soaking in our very menstrual blood
          and nocturnal emissions. This is
          what I want to try to give people,
          Hazel. And I want your help.
          Hazel just stares. The food arrives. Caden looks at his
          plate and concentrates.

          Caden, beads of sweat on his forehead, sits with a large
          group of actors, Tom, Claire, and Davis from Salesman among
          them. No one speaks. Finally, Caden clears his throat.

          CADEN
          We'll start by talking honestly.
          Out of that a piece of theater will
          evolve. I'll begin.

          to the alley. She's gone. He walks through, looking for
          her. It's dark. Trash cans and garbage. He spots an
          unopened box next to the trash. It's pink with a picture of
          a nose on it. Caden drops to his knees and weeps. No tears
          come out. His eyes are dry and red. He pulls a vial of
          artificial tears from his pockets and moistens his eyes.
          Suddenly his breathing becomes wildly erratic.

          German words painted on the walls. Caden, in his underwear,
          lies on a metal table in a cold room, while an old man in
          white military jacket examines him, pressing on his body in
          various places. The man is silent except for slow, long
          inhalations and exhalations through his nose. When he is
          through he leaves the room without saying a word. Caden lies
          there, not sure what heÃ¢â¬â¢s supposed to do. After a while, he
          gets up and opens the door, looks both ways down the empty
          hall. He closes the door, sits in a plastic chair and waits.

          85 INT. PLANE - 2015 - NIGHT 85

          Caden sits. A tube runs from his nostril to a small whirring
          machine on his lap. A frail old man sits next to him.

          OLD MAN
          Death comes faster than you think.

          Caden, walking with a realtor, approaches a warehouse in a
          very old, decrepit, and abandoned-looking part of town.

          CADEN
          Yeah, I want to bring my production
          to New York. To get it seen. By
          people, you know, who matter. The
          sooner the better.

          REALTOR
          Well, this theater is centrally
          located. Heart of the theater
          district. So... great for plays.

          It's massive, empty, old, and dirty. Caden inspects it while
          the agent watches from a distance.

          It's been scrubbed. There are small squared-off "apartment" 
          areas, with actors in each, going about their days. A couple  
          sleeps in a bed in one, in another there is a conversation  
          between people over dinner, a man watches television alone in 
          one, etc. There are at least fifteen configurations of  
          people with a reel-to-reel tape recorders in each set-up. 
          Caden walks from one to the other, eavesdropping, followed by 
          an assistant, Michael.  

           PATIENT (IN ONE "APARTMENT") 
          (to doctor) 
          And then he said he couldn't see me 
          anymore. Just like that. I don't  
          understand. I... I mean, he just  
          told me two days before how much he 
          loves me. Everything's spinning out 
          of control. 
          He stops at Claire's "apartment." She is ironing and  
          watching a daytime soap, which is a closed-circuit TV. The  
          actors in the soap are across the warehouse in another  
          apartment.

          Claire shoots daggers at Caden and goes back to ironing.  
          Nearby, Tom and Davis rehearse their scene in another

          Caden in an embrace with a muscular skinhead. The movie is

          Michael, surveys the scene by climbing up and down ladders.
          It's difficult to manage with his cane.

          104 INT. CLAIRE KITCHEN (NYC APARTMENT) - 2021 - LATE NIGHT 104

          Caden reads Olive's diary.

          OLIVE'S GERMAN VOICE
          Today I felt a wetness between my
          legs. Maria explained to me now I
          am a woman. And being a woman is
          wonderful with Maria to guide me.

          105 EXT. BERLIN STREET - 2022 - DAY 105

          Overcast. Caden wanders. Walls are plastered with posters
          of "Flower Girl." It's Olive, early 20's, very sexy and
          naked. There is an address and a date. Seems to be some
          sort of concert.

          106 INT. LOBBY - 2022 - NIGHT 106

          Caden waits on a long line behind a bunch of men.

          107 INT DARK SMALL ROOM - NIGHT 107
          Caden sits by himself in a cramped space. A light switches
          on behind scarred Plexiglas. Olive dances naked. Caden
          tries to get her attention by banging on the glass but she
          can't see him. A bouncer enters and beats Caden up.

          108 INT. CLAIRE'S BEDROOM (NYC APARTMENT) - 2022 - MORNING108

          Caden, bruised, lies in bed while Claire hurries past,
          getting dressed.

          The neighborhood seems abandoned and overgrown. Caden is
          parked down the block and watches Hazel's house. Soon Hazel
          and Derek walk by. Derek says something and Hazel laughs
          delightedly. Caden is in agony. He rolls down his window.

          CADEN

          Hazel and Derek turn.

          Hazel kisses Derek, whispers something in his ear. They
          share a giggle. Derek waves at Caden and heads into the
          burning house. Hazel approaches Caden's car.

          Caden stands with his cane before the group of seated actors.
          The actors wait patiently as Caden finishes a coughing fit.

          CADEN
          I won't settle for anything less
          than the brutal truth. Brutal!

          The actors are in their apartments living their lives. Caden
          is in the far corner of the space, at a little sectioned-off
          area. There are a half-dozen actors sitting on folding
          chairs outside the partition. They all resemble Caden,
          except one very tall one. Hazel steps around the partition.

          HAZEL
          Sammy Barnathan?
          Sammy Barnathan stands. He is the gaunt man we've seen
          following Caden. Hazel leads him to Caden. Caden stands.

          This is Sammy Barnathan.I don't have a resume or

          by following you. Hire me and you

          The room is filthy. Flies buzz. The urinals are covered

          sits. He strains. When he is done, he looks at his stool.
          It's gray. He wipes and flushes, pulls up his pants and
          exits the stall. Sammy stands there.

          it. The doors close and the elevator continues its shaky
          ascent. The doors open on 31 and Caden exits.

          Sound of the elevator descending. Caden heads down the long
          hall, looking at apartment numbers. He gets to the end and
          is only at 31J. He turns and heads back. The elevator is
          ascending again. As he passes the elevator door, it opens
          and a very old, feeble-looking man or woman steps out.

          OLD PERSON
          I asked you to hold the door.

          CADEN OLD PERSON
          I'm sorry. I pressed it, butYou didn't press it.
          I think it was too late.
          Caden continues to walk down the hall. The old person walks
          behind him. Caden looks behind him and smiles awkwardly.

          CADEN
          Have a good night.
          He picks up his pace, trying to be casual about it. He
          arrives at 31Y, glances over and sees the old person knocking
          feebly on a door down the hall.

          Frances, I need to go to the
          clinic. Something's terribly wrong
          with my nose.
          Caden knocks on 31Y. No answer. He knocks again. Down the
          hall, the door opens and another old person steps out into
          the hall. This person examines the first old person's nose.

          OLD PERSON #2
          Oh yes. I see.
          Old Person #2 squints over at Caden.

          forget to change the sheets.

          Ok. Thank you.
          Old Person #2 turns and heads back down the hall to Old
          Person #1, whose nose has started to bleed.

          The actors are in their "apartments" and rehearsal is in
          progress. Caden walks along the scaffolding followed by
          Hazel. He hands scraps of paper to each actor he passes,
          then turns his attention to Sammy and Claire. She's in her
          underwear and getting dressed. Sammy comes up behind her and
          rubs her ass.

          CLAIRE
          I don't like that guy you got to
          play you.

          SAMMY
          You don't like Sammy? Why? I
          think he's good.

          CLAIRE
          I think you need to fire him.
          Caden hands her a scrap of paper.

          Oh, fuck you. I'm forty-five years

          anymore.

          SAMMY
          I'm not firing him, Claire. He's
          the best thing in the show. Next
          to you.

          CLAIRE
          He's coming on to me. He's feeling
          my ass during rehearsal.

          SAMMY
          He's your husband.
          Claire turns to the real Caden and screams.

          Sammy sits at the table and starts to write on scraps of

          Caden looks over at Hazel. Claire watches Caden from the
          street corner.

          Caden looks at the unmade bed, an imprint of a female form in
          the sheets. He touches it. He gets a melancholy look on his
          face. He lies on his back in the form. He sees a note on
          the night table:

          a self-portrait of Adele, a portrait of Maria, a portrait of
          Olive, naked and covered in tattoos. Then he comes to a
          portrait entitled "Ellen Bascomb." He steps back for a
          second, unable to look. The people behind him are impatient.
          Finally he flips the glasses and studies the painting. Ellen
          appears to be a chubby, 40 year old white woman, her mousy
          brown hair tied back in a kerchief. She is naked and
          spreading her vulva for the viewer. She has a kind face and

          apartment building structure. An actress plays Claire. She
          sits at the kitchen table of her apartment with an actor
          playing the actor. They both hold scripts and read from
          Needleman in a Haystack. Sammy is in front of the building,
          looking up. Caden looks troubled. Tammy sits to the side of
          Hazel and studies her. Every once in a while, Hazel self-

          gaze.

          Sammy stands across the street from the walled-up apartment
          building, an exact replica of the real one. He looks up at
          Claire's lighted window. Caden watches, pleased.

          144INT. CADEN'S APARTMENT - 2029 - NIGHT144

          Caden, hooked up to pumps, tries to sleep on the floor,
          surrounded by boxes. He listens to Claire having sex next
          door. He detaches his pumps, gets dressed.

          145INT. 31Y BEDROOM - 2029 - NIGHT145

          Caden sits on the bed and reads a note from Adele:

          ADELE'S VOICE
          Good for you with your grant!
          Listen, I fixed up the walk-in as a
          sort of bedroom if you want. We'd
          love to have you and you wouldn't
          have to schlep all the way to
          Queens. Just a thought. Kisses.

          A.

          146INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET - 2029 - NIGHT 146

          Caden sees an unmade cot in the corner and a few cardboard
          boxes marked "Stuff for Olive." The "Olive" is crossed out
          and replaced with "Caden."

          147INT. 31Y WALK-IN CLOSET - 2029 - LATER 147

          The boxes are empty as Caden finishes making the bed. The
          room is decorated in a girly manner. Pink bedspread. Girly
          lamps and furniture. Girly prints on the walls.

          Sammy, walking with a cane, exits his apartment building set
          and walks down the street. Caden and Hazel follow. Sammy
          passes people, nods hello to some. He stops at a newsstand
          and buys a paper. The set seems to go on forever.

           Eventually Sammy arrives at a warehouse that looks exactly
           like the warehouse they are in. He enters.

          Inside it looks exactly like the warehouse, including a
          duplicate city set. Sammy hands little scraps of paper to
          people, then dumps his pack on the table where Tammy sits.
          Hazel and Caden watch.

          SAMMY
          Morning, Haze.

          TAMMY
          Hi, Caden. How was your night?

          SAMMY
          Okay. Yours?

          TAMMY
          Eh. Philip was colicky. I was up
          all night.
          Caden looks over at Hazel for confirmation. She nods,
          slightly freaked out.

          CADEN
          Sorry.

          SAMMY
          (to Tammy)
          Sorry. Everybody here?

          TAMMY

          Sammy's not here. Jimmy called and
          said there's some subway problem.
          Jimmy rushes into the warehouse.

          SAMMY (CONT'D)
          Hazel, could you get everyone
          situated? I need to speak to Will
          about some new sets.
          Sammy pulls some Polaroids out of his backpack.

          TAMMY
          Yeah. We'll take it from June 9th?
          Sammy nods, heads toward the set designer's office.

          CADEN
          Oh, shit. I need to do that, too.
          Haze, keep an eye on things?

          HAZEL
          Yup. June 9th?
          Caden nods, rushes out the door of the warehouse set.

          Caden sits at his desk. There are several overweight women
          waiting on the other side of the partition. Hazel ushers one
          in. She's a ringer for the painting of Ellen.

          CADEN
          Hazel, what do you think of this
          title: Unknown, Unkissed, and Lost?

          HAZEL
          Eh. Caden this is Millicent Weems.

          are you at cleaning?

          it. You'd play a cleaning lady.

          MILLICENT
          I played Egga the cleaning lady in

          visualized for this character.

          Millicent and Caden study each other.

          152EXT. CITY STREETS (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2032 - DAY 152

          Caden heads to the warehouse set. He hands paper scraps to
          shopkeepers, pedestrians, a guy sweeping the street.

          CADEN
          Good work, everyone.
          Nobody acknowledges him.

          Caden enters the warehouse set. Tammy sits alone at the card
          table. There's activity on the street and movement can be
          seen in various windows.

          CADEN
          Where're Sammy and Hazel?
          Tammy jerks her head to the left. Caden sees that Sammy has
          Hazel with her back against a wall. They are talking
          intimately. Caden approaches.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          Hey, Sammy, what are you doing?
          Sammy and Hazel look over casually.

          SAMMY
          Hi, Caden. I'm being you. You
          like Hazel; I like Hazel.

          If you want to like a Hazel, like

          The actors playing the people on the street immediately stop
          what they're doing. Actors pour from apartment buildings and
          shops, lighting cigarettes and talking on cell phones. Sammy
          goes off.

          you're the next best thing but

          Although the thing is offstage
          you're nothing like her. You play
          her very well though. Did Hazel
          mention what she was doing tonight
          because I called her house before
          we left and her husband said she
          wasn't going to be back till late
          and I thought that was weird
          because she told me Philip was

          Caden turns off the lights and climbs into the twin bed with
          Tammy. She looks at his face, then kisses him.

          Hazel drives a golf cart along a fake highway. Caden and
          Tammy sit in back. Hazel eyes them in the rearview mirror.
          They seem cozy. Hazel scowls. Technicians are on the side
          of the road putting in plants and trees.

          CADEN
          I think both of you Hazels are
          going to like this. Turn off here.
          Hazel rolls her eyes, drives down an exit ramp.

          Hazel drives the golf cart down the street in a state of near

          CADEN
          Hank! Okay!
          The house begins to smoke.

          kissing?

          CADEN
          It's verisimilitudinous. I'm

          Whatever. I've got work to do.
          Tell your girlfriend to get out
          here if she wants a ride back.

          Sammy walks down the hall followed by Tammy. He stops at
          various doorways and listens to conversations or other noises
          within the apartments. They are followed by Caden and Hazel.

          SAMMY
          Jeremy is playing to us. Tell him
          he simply needs to talk to Donna.
          We'll hear what we hear.
          Tammy takes down the note.

          CADEN
          Sammy's explaining too much. Feels
          expository. Needs to be shorthand,
          like, "Jeremy big."
          Hazel writes that down. They all continue down the hall.

          TAMMY
          Caden? Can we stop for a second?

          CADEN
          Sure.

          TAMMY
          If Hazel's in love with Sammy and
          Caden's in love with Hazel, there
          would be a dramatic confrontation,
          where Caden turns to me and says,
          "It's obvious he's a substitute for
          me." I think then Hazel could have
          a good moment where she cries or
          gets angry. I'm not sure which
          yet, but it feels dramatically
          sound.

          HAZEL
          That didn't happen, Caden.

          TAMMY
          I think Hazel would do that, Hazel.

          But Hazel hasn't done it, Tammy.

          CADEN
          Tammy was right. I don't
          understand why you're with Sammy.

          He's nice. He's available. He
          fucks me without crying.

          Yes! And you and I only fucked one

          can start fresh, like Sammy and I

          The actor playing Sammy is in the coffin. There's an
          enormous crowd. Tammy plays Hazel and weeps. A stand-in for
          Sammy as Caden stands next to her. Caden and Hazel watch
          from the director's table.

          CADEN
          Do you see what I'm saying?
          Hazel has her head in her hands. She looks over at Caden,
          imploringly.

          HAZEL
          Come over tonight? Please?

          The smoke is thick and there are flames. Hazel, in a robe,
          walks around lighting candles. Caden unpacks his pumps and
          monitors and places them next to the bed.

          CADEN
          We could get a place together. We
          could get a loft.

          HAZEL
          God, Caden, that sounds nice. I
          miss my daughter. Maybe she could
          come live with us.

          CADEN
          Yeah. I miss Olive. And the other
          one. The retarded one.

          HAZEL
          I'm a bad person.

           No you're not. I'm a badI am. I should never... have

           just trying to get to you.

           CADEN
          You can't cause someone to kill
          himself. He was troubled.

          HAZEL
          I'm so ashamed of myself.
          Caden walks over to her and touches her shoulder.

          HAZEL (CONT'D)
          Oh, Caden. I wish we had this when
          we were young. And all the years
          in between. So many years, so
          fast.

          (CRYING)
          What did we do?
          Caden kisses Hazel's forehead. She coughs and smiles up at
          him, then cranes her neck and kisses him on the lips.

          CADEN
          My heart aches so much for you.

          HAZEL
          We're here, Caden. I'm here.

          I'm aching for it being over.

          Yeah. The end is built in to the
          beginning. What can you do?

          CADEN

          HAZEL
          I'm a mess. But we fit, don't we.
          They kiss, then Hazel climbs into bed.

          CADEN
          It doesn't always happen for me
          now. Because of the medication and
          everything. I take a lot of pills.

          me. It's the medication.
          They are tender and quiet and intensely focused. The smoke
          in the room is dense. When it's over, they lie there
          quietly, with the occasional cough from both of them. Caden
          cries quietly.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          I'm sorry.

          HAZEL
          It's okay. It's different crying
          this time. I can tell. I'm
          crying, too. And I cried last
          time. After you left. I never
          told you. But I cried, too.
          Caden kisses her again.

          171INT. BURNING HOUSE - KITCHEN - 2035 - MORNING171

          Caden agitatedly paces through the dense smoke. He passes a
          scrapbook on the table. It's open to a page with ripped-up
          napkin pieces glued to it. He's crying hard. There's
          mumbling, quiet conversation coming from somewhere. He walks

          MEDIC
          Might be smoke inhalation.
          Caden just nods his head for a long time.

          173INT. CADEN'S CAR - 2041 - DAY173

          Caden drives. He stops at a school crossing as a group of
          young children are led across the street in front of his car.
          A young girl with red hair is among them.

          She looks at Caden and he is struck by her resemblance to
          young Olive. Suddenly the passenger door opens and Maria gets
          in the car. He glances over at her, then looks back out the
          windshield.

          MARIA
          Olive wants to see you. God knows
          why; the way you abandoned her.

          CADEN MARIA
          Oh, shut up.She's had a fucked-up life
          with issues, thanks to you.

          CADEN MARIA
          You're insane.She's dying, asshole. Is
          that insane enough for you?

          MARIA (CONT'D)

          174 INT. NYC HOSPITAL ROOM - 2041 - DAY 174

          Maria leads Caden into the room. Olive, 40, lies in bed,
          emaciated and pale. Maria and Olive speak only in German.

          MARIA OLIVE

          Maria kisses Olive again on the forehead.

          CADEN OLIVE
          No. I'm sorry.I had hope you have learned.
          Weakly, Olive points to a headset on her night table. She
          pantomimes putting it on. Caden puts it on. Olive puts on
          her own. There follows a slightly delayed and staticky
          translation, in an accented male voice, of everything Olive
          says, with a delay between what Caden says and Olive's
          response, as she listens in translation.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          I'm dying, as I'm sure Maria told
          you. The flower tattoos have
          become infected and they're dying.
          So I am, as well. This is life.
          Olive pulls down her hospital gown a bit to show Caden the
          now sickly and decayed flower tattoos.

          CADEN
          It's Maria. She did this.

          OLIVE
          Maria gave me reason to live once
          you left. The flowers defined me.

          CADEN
          Your mother and Maria took you
          away. I tried for years to find
          you. I didn't leave you.

          OLIVE
          You did something.
          Caden is affected by this. It resonates.

          OLIVE (CONT'D)
          I want to talk to you about your
          homosexuality.

          CADEN
          What? I'm not a homosexual!

          OLIVE
          Maria said you would deny it.

          CADEN
          She's lying to you.

          OLIVE
          I had the same struggle when I
          first fell in love with Maria and
          we began to have dirty, aching sex.

          You have no idea how evil she is.

          OLIVE
          I need to forgive you before I die,

          It's sweltering. Caden sits on his stoop, holding some dead
          flower petals, watching the world pass by. People are sick,
          angry. Some people wear gas masks. Government vehicles with
          strange symbols and gun turrets drive by. A woman walks a
          naked man on a leash. He defecates on the sidewalk. A wild-
          eyed man in a white t-shirt and Santa hat attacks Caden. As
          he knocks Caden to the ground and wrestles with him, Caden
          sees the t-shirt has a little dot: a painting from Adele's
          show. It's a moment in time, a street scene very much like
          the one Caden's in. In the painting, a man in a white t-
          shirt and Santa hat beats up a man who looks like Caden. The
          flower petals blow away. Caden tries to limp after them.

          course of one day. The day will be

          Caden weeps inconsolably at the director's table, Michael the
          pre-Hazel assistant is back, neat and efficient-looking, but
          old now. Hazel's dog, Squishy, sleeps on the floor. The
          scene in the play is dull. People walk back and forth
          aimlessly. Various passersby on the street have hacking
          coughs. Tammy steps out of the bathroom, meanders over to
          the director's table. Hazel's sweater is on Michael's chair-
          back. She casually pulls it off and tries it on. Caden
          watches. She looks so much like Hazel now, it's unbearable.
          He looks away. Millicent walks by carrying a mop and bucket.

          Hazel and an actor playing the stand-in for Sammy playing
          Caden. Tammy has her head in her hands. She looks over at

          woman eyeing each other flirtatiously from a distance, an old  
          woman with Parkinson's fiddling with Rosary beads, a well- 
          dressed woman squatting and peeing near a gravesite. A 
          minister addresses the mourners. 

          MINISTER 
          Everything is more complicated than  
          you think. You only see a tenth of 
          what is true. There are a million  
          little strings attached to every 
          choice you make; you can destroy 
          your life every time you choose. 
          But maybe you won't know for twenty  
          years. And you'll never ever trace 
          it to its source. And you only get 
          one chance to play it out. Just try  
          and figure out your own divorce. 
          And they say there is no fate, but 
          there is: it's what you create.  
          Even though the world goes on for  
          eons and eons, you are here for a  
          fraction of a fraction of a second.  
          Most of your time is spent being 
          dead or not yet born. But while  
          alive, you wait in vain, wasting 
          years, for a phone call or a letter  
          or a look from someone or something  
          to make it all right. And it never 
          comes or it seems to but doesn't 
          really. And so you spend your time 
          in vague regret or vaguer hope for 
          something good to come along.  
          Something to make you feel 
          connected, to make you feel whole, 
          to make you feel loved.

           MINISTER (CONT'D)
           And the truth is I'm so angry and 
           the truth is I'm so fucking sad,  
           and the truth is I've been so 
           fucking hurt for so fucking long  
           and for just as long have been  
           pretending I'm ok, just to get  
           along, just for, I don't know why,  
           maybe because no one wants to hear  
           about my misery, because they have  
           their own, and their own is too 
           overwhelming to allow them to 
           listen to or care about mine. 
           Well, fuck everybody. 
           Amen. 
           Soon it starts to rain. Thunder rumbles. People pull out  
           umbrellas. Caden looks up, surprised that such a system is  
           rigged here.

          NIGHT
          Caden sits with Michael at the director's table and stares
          into space. The actors are doing what they've always done,
          milling, walking to and fro. Millicent, holding hands with
          Tammy, heads up the walk to the Hazel's house set.

          CADEN
          Millicent.
          She turns. He waves her over. Tammy sits on the stoop.

          CADEN (CONT'D)
          That was ... spectacular.

          MICHAEL
          It really was! Delightful!

          Caden sits on the unmade bed and reads the note:

          ADELE'S VOICE
          Ellen, Olive has died. It's a time
          of overwhelming grief so please
          forgive my mess; I haven't been
          able to get out of bed. Until
          today. Much affection, A.
          Caden crosses to the window and looks up at the night sky,
          even though it's clearly the ceiling of the warehouse. A
          tiny plane flies by.

          182 INT. 31Y HALLWAY (INT. WAREHOUSE SET) - 2050 - NIGHT182

          Caden walks down the hall carrying a bag of garbage to the
          incinerator chute, dumps it in, and turns back to apartment
          31Y. Old Person #2 (actor version) is standing there.

          OLD PERSON #2 (ACTOR)
          Ellen? Is your name Ellen?

          CADEN
          Yes?

          Caden examines it. Old Person #2 (actor) points to his own
          ear, in which he wears one. Caden sticks it in his ear.

          MILLICENT'S VOICE
          ... touched by the sadness of
          Adele's neighbor. So close to
          death. Reminds me of granny. I
          should really call her. Remember
          how Granny Bascomb bounced me on
          her knee pretending to be a horsie.
          I loved that so much. Say thank
          you to Adele's neighbor.

          ... miss him. Why did he have to
          get bored with me? Everyone gets
          bored with me. I'm not very
          bright. And since I put on that
          weight, I don't get the looks I
          used to. It's not that bad. Lots
          of people have it worse. I've got
          a job and place to stay. Adele is
          nice to me. And so smart and
          talented. I don't understand her
          artwork, but that's just me. I
          wish I'd gone to college. I feel
          stupid around educated people like
          Adele. Eric was too smart for me,
          too. We didn't talk at all near
          the end.

          him; he seemed so miserable with

          Caden drifts off to sleep.

          184INT. ELLEN'S KITCHEN - (2050) - MORNING 184

          A tenement apartment. Ellen, in a terrycloth robe, is at the
          stove making scrambled eggs. Toast pops from the toaster and
          Ellen crosses to get it. She passes a mirror, glances at
          herself, seems momentarily surprised, pushes a wisp of hair
          behind her ear and continues to the toaster. Eric enters.
          He's an unhealthily thin middle-aged man. He doesn't
          acknowledge her, nor she him. He pours himself coffee.

          ELLEN
          I'm making eggs.

          (BEAT)
          Is everything okay, Eric?

          ERIC
          Everything's everything.

          Ellen sits on the bed with a cup of coffee and stares out the
          window. There's a city park across the street and she
          watches kids play basketball. She begins to weep.

          186EXT. FIELD - (2050) - DAY 186

          It's spring and a ten year old girl watches her mother as she
          lays out a picnic on a blanket on the ground.

          MOTHER
          Ellen, why do you look so serious?

          ELLEN
          I'm going to remember this moment
          for the rest of my life, mama. And
          in exactly twenty years, come here
          with my daughter and have exactly
          the same picnic.

          MOTHER
          Baby, that's the loveliest thing
          I've ever heard.

          ELLEN
          There was supposed to be something
          else. I was to have something. A
          calm. A love. Children. A child,
          at least. Children. Meaning. I
          am always on the verge, never more
          than a tiny shove from tears. I
          can feel them in my chest now.
          That squeezing pressure. And it
          is so tempting to let go, but I am
          afraid, the next time maybe, I will
          never stop crying. I miss my
          husband even though he is lying
          here. He hates me. Oh God. I
          have disappointed him and he hates
          me. The one person who should be
          able to see me and he won't look.
          He will never look again.

          No lights. Vague daylight drifts in from high warehouse
          windows, from which cardboard has fallen. Deadly quiet,
          abandoned. Caden passes the occasional body on the street.
          Fires smolder in buildings. The streets are flooded with
          sewer water. Buildings are draped with massive tarps. Behind

          he can with his limp, his weakness, his ancient body, to
          catch up with her.

          we'll never know. That's the truth
          of it -- all the thoughts nobody
          will ever know.

          WOMAN
          It's true.

          CADEN
          I'm sorry the experiment didn't
          work. I wanted it to with all my
          heart. I wanted to do that picnic
          with my daughter. I feel I've
          disappointed you terribly.

          WOMAN
          No. No. I am so proud of you.
          Caden starts to tear up.

          CADEN
          All I want is someone to see me,
          someone to look at me with
          kindness. For me to be the most
          special person in the world to just
          one person.

          WOMAN
          I know, baby. I know.
          He looks at her tentatively. She's looking into his eyes
          directly, clearly, kindly. She smiles.

          WOMAN (CONT'D)
          You're going to be fine.
          Caden starts to weep so hard he chokes. Strings of snot pour
          from his nose. The woman holds him, gently takes off his
          wig, and strokes his sparse hair. He looks out over her
          shoulder at the dark empty city at the far end of the
          warehouse. His rheumy eyes light up.

          CADEN
          I know what to do with this play
          now. I have an idea. I think --
          The screen goes black fast.

          1 SUMMER. POSY DRAWING 1

                         

          2 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 2

           Andy Cobb, early thirties, is digging an English garden in
           the hot sun. He is lean, naked to the waist. It's hard to
           tell which century he inhabits. Only when he stops to drink
           from a plastic bottle do we realise he is of our time.

           TESS (V.O.)
           And love slipped the bonds of
           restraint...
           At a table under a willow tree sits Tess - early fifties,
           funky specs - at a laptop. She pauses in her typing, staring
           at Andy.

           TESS (V.O.)(CONT'D)
           His touch was like a cosmic `yes'.
           Underneath a converted barn, cross-legged on a bench in a
           bikini top, sits Eustacia. She is hunched over a note pad,
           writing at tremendous speed, oblivious to all but her work.

           EUSTACIA (V.O.)
           `Fuck you,' screamed Kelly, `Fuck
           you to hell!' Scott stepped back
           from the cell door as the gob of
           spit flew.'

          1A INT. DAY. GLEN'S ROOM. 1A

           Sitting at a barn window is American academic Glen McCreavy ;
           a physically awkward man, more at home with his intellect
           than his body. He is surrounded by foolscap, post-it notes,
           books and markers - dominated by a poster of a dour Victorian
           - Thomas Hardy. He is writing. 

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           This complex contemporary matrix is 
           what Hardy meant by `the ache of 
           modernism.' 
           He regards it. 

                          GLEN
           Crap.
           He deletes it. He looks at his blank screen, breathing
           deeply. The only words left say `Chapter Six'.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Inchcombe had seen it all before.
           He'd seasoned it: the metallic
           smell of blood and gunshot;
           forensics hunched like vultures.
           The dreadful mundanity of murder,
           he thought.



                         

                         

                         

          3 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 3

           Nicholas Hardiment writes fluidly with pencil and paper. A
           good-looking man of fifty. Dark hair, strong figure.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           He approached Patel, who was
           stricken. She was one for whom a
           corpse was still an obscenity.
           Inchcombe realised a disturbing
           truth. His lack of feeling was
           almost...
           (He stops writing. Sighs)

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Pathological...

                         

          4 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE PLAYGROUND. 4

           A playground on the edge of an idyllic English village. Jody
           Long - fourteen, skinny, restless - is lying at the bottom of
           the slide gazing at the clouds. Casey Shaw, her shy, placid
           best friend, is sitting on a toddler toy, reading aloud from
           a magazine.

                          CASEY
           `I've been wearing the wrong size
           all my life,' said Katie. `I was
           always popping out. Turns out I'm a
           30GG,' she says. `Now my bras
           finally fit - though Simon prefers
           me without one.'
           Jody checks to see if her breasts have grown. She sighs.

                         

          4A INT. DAY. KITCHEN. 4A

           A woman in an upmarket apron is taking a tray of scones and
           biscuits out of the aga. It's Beth Hardiment. Once pretty,
           she's now mumsy and countrified.
           She examines her baking, satisfied with its perfection.
           Mary, the help, is doing the washing-up.

                          BETH
           Do you think I should be reminding
           them to drink enough? It's very hot
           out there...

                          MARY
           Beth - they're writers, not babies.
           You run round after `em too much.

          5 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 5

           Glen walks outside, breathing in the fresh air. Beth
           approaches with her tray of scones and biscuits.

                          BETH
           Can I tempt you, Glen?

                          GLEN
           Wow, thanks.
           Glen picks up a scone.

                          BETH
           I often take something snacky down
           to Nicholas at this time of day. I
           know how the brain needs feeding.
           How are you settling in?

                          GLEN
           Great. The last writer's retreat I
           stayed at kind of froze my balls off,
           you know?

                          BETH
           Oh.

                          GLEN
           Screeching firedoors, curried
           lasagne and a needy poet - from whom
           I still bear the scars.

                          BETH
           We try to keep it peaceful here;
           far from the madding crowd.

                          GLEN
           Well, it's paradise.

                         

          6 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - VILLAGE STREET. TRIANGLE. 6

           The blight on this rural paradise is a vandalised bus shelter
           near the only T-junction in the village. A twee shop, hanging
           baskets and Grade II listed buildings make up the view. It's
           shatteringly dull.
           Casey and Jody walk up towards the bus shelter. Their boredom
           is epic.

           An open-topped BMW goes past and halts briefly by the
           junction. The tones of Classic FM blare out, much to the
           enjoyment of the middle aged couple within.

                          CASEY
           Frock horrors. This weeks top of
           the shocks goes to Katie Pound in
           an off the shoulder lime by
           Roberto.

                          JODY
           She looks like a bug.
           (Car hoots) Wankers!

                          CASEY
           You wanna sack your stylist girl.

                          JODY
           Bet they did that on purpose,
           dressed her up like an insect.
           Casey agrees. They zoom away.

                         

          7 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. THE GROUNDS. 7

           Glen lowers himself into a comfy garden chair, his mouth full
           of cream and jam. Behind him, Nicholas' shed.

                          GLEN
           Perfect harmony.

                         

          8 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED. 8

           Nicholas is panicking down the phone.

                          NICHOLAS
           In Ewedown? Nadia, what the ffff
           are you doing there? I haven't told
           her yet.

          8A EXT. EWEDOWN. THE STREET NEAR THE BUS STOP. 8A

           Nadia is walking up the road from the station in her high
           heels, carrying an overnight bag. She is weeping into her
           phone.

                          NADIA
           Why not? You keep saying you want
           to be with me.
           Jody and Casey are all ears.

                          NICHOLAS
           I can't tell her just like that.
           It's twenty five years; a marriage.

                          NADIA
          Come on Nicholas. Or I'm going to
          get in a taxi and find your farm.
          Come up there and -

                          NICHOLAS

                         NO -

                          NADIA
          Drag you out -

                          NICHOLAS

           NO, NO DON'T!

                          NADIA
           I want to be with you. I thought
           you'd be pleased...

                         

          8B POV. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD / INT. DAY. NICHOLAS' SHED 8B

           Through the window Nicholas sees Beth leaving a scone by
           Diggory, a sleeping poet in a pretentious hat.

                          NICHOLAS
           Of course I'm pleased... Nadia, go
           to the pub and stay there. I'll come
           when I can.

                          NADIA
           Are you going to tell her?

                          NICHOLAS
           Just give me a couple of hours -
           He ends the call just as Beth is nearing the door - panicking
           the phone back on to its holder.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Cock pie.
           Beth opens the door to see Nicholas apparently hard at it.

                          BETH
           How's the worker?

                          NICHOLAS
           Good actually. Just about to embark
           on forensics.

                          BETH
           Well give me your pages and I'll get
           started.
           Nicholas hands her several pages.

                          NICHOLAS
           Reckon I might pack it in a bit
           early today. Need to think about my
           blood smears. Might take a drive;
           have a pint. Stir the old grey
           matter up.

                          BETH
           Who were you talking to just then?

                          NICHOLAS
           Judy. She says the Impala contracts
           should be through in a day or two.

          Beth immediately knows he is lying. The lie pains her. She
          goes to the door.

           Beth decides to try and call his bluff.

                          BETH
           I could come with you.

                          NICHOLAS
           What?

                          BETH
           For a drive. I don't know when we
           last went out.
           Buying time by biting his scone:

                          NICHOLAS
           This is absolutely yummy.

                          BETH
           We could go into Hadditon, get a
           meal.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes but. What about the guests?

                          BETH
           Mary's got Casey to help.

                          NICHOLAS
           But I'm supposed to be thinking,
           you know about the -

                          BETH
           You can run it by me. I'm good at
           forensics.
           Nicholas has run out of excuses.

           Beth approaches Andy with her scones and biscuits. Nearby,
           Glen is sitting back in a sun-lounger. Diggory sleeps on.

                          BETH
           Can I tempt you, Andy?
           Andy takes a scone with a wide smile.

           That's Glen, our new academic. Turns
           out he's working on Thomas Hardy.

           The same car drives through the village. Jody and Casey
           appear from behind a wall and chuck eggs at it. They both
           land on the windscreen.

                          JODY
           Fucking bingo!
           Jody and Casey run away, laughing.

                         

          11A EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 11A

           The driver brakes, swerves and comes to a halt. Tamara Drewe
           gets out. She's twenty eight, startlingly beautiful. She
           looks around shocked, for the culprit.
           The immaculate, picturesque street is deserted. Tamara takes
           it in, with an expression of such distaste that it might as
           well be a landfill site.

                          TAMARA
           What a dump.
           As she drives away, we see Nadia sitting outside the pub in
           her urban heels, anxiously smoking a cigarette.

           Tamara drives up to an old farmhouse. She gets out of the car
           and stands at the gate. Air of neglect; dark windows. Tamara
           looks at the place as if it stirs memories. She doesn't move.

          14 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 14

           At the back of the house Tamara walks through an overgrown,
           neglected garden. She peers through the back door into the
           kitchen. A thin layer of dust on the surfaces; a sense of
           recent abandonment.
           Suddenly a pigeon flies out from the porch eaves - just over
           her head. Tamara startles. It completely spooks her. She
           backs away. She doesn't know what to do.

                         

          13 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 13

           Jody and Casey are slouched on the bench at the bus stop.
           Three teenage boys are doing wheelies over the T-junction.
           One of them almost lands in the shop. An old lady comes out,
           shoo-ing them away.

                          JODY
           We could walk up the garage.

                          CASEY
           I'm supposed to be helping my mum
           up at Stonefield.

                          JODY
           They keep you busy.

                          CASEY
           Yeah.

                          JODY
           You never stop, you!
           Neither of them moves. The boys are yelling. Two try to put
           the third head first into the bin outside the shop. Jody and
           Casey are not impressed.

           The writers are sitting round a table lit with tea-lights in
           jars. Casey is helping her mum, Mary, an efficient local
           woman in her late thirties. She wobbles the heavy serving
           dishes dangerously.

           At an upstairs window we can see Beth hold a dress up to
           herself and then abandon the idea.

           Upstairs, through a window, we see Beth is putting on a

           Beth is looking at herself in a cheval mirror. She's full of
           hope that Nicholas will take her out - and dread that he'll
           find some excuse.

           The door to the garden is open, letting in the eveing air.
           Nicholas is waiting for Beth by the mirror. He is full of
           unease - but can't help finding himself handsome. His phone
           bleeps; a text. He reads it anxiously.

                          NICHOLAS

                          (CALLING)
           Beth, why don't I just pop out on
           my own?
           Beth, determined to force things, comes downstairs.

                          BETH
           But I'm ready. Come on.
           She's on her way to join him.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that - I mean - are you wearing
           that?

                          BETH
           Oh.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just looks a bit... hot.
           Now Beth knows she is right. She takes her jacket off,
           gutted.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           You know, Haddition's always packed
           with pissed Londonites on a Friday. I
           doubt we'll get a table anyway. Let's
           do it properly next week; make an
           occasion. I'm always taking you for
           granted. I'm vile I know; you should
           kick me really, but -
           He's about to leave. Beth speaks calmly.

                          BETH
           Who is she?
           The question hangs in the air. Nicholas' smile is frozen.

                          NICHOLAS
           What?
           For a moment, he tries to find a lie.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Oh come on, Beth.

                          BETH

           Look, it's nothing. It's been once
           or twice, that's all. Beth, it's
           not anything.
           Beth is raw with pain.

                          BETH

           Just a researcher with Radio 4.

                          BETH
           What's her name?

           Nadia, Nadia Patel.
           This hits a nerve.

           Patel? She's in your book.

                          NICHOLAS
           No, no I met her when I was on
           Desert Island Discs.

                          BETH
           You put her in your book!

                          NICHOLAS
           Just the name.

                          BETH
           And Desert Island Discs was a year
           ago.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes but -

           Shhh!...
           Beth's pained voice drifts out of the house.

           BETH (O.S.)

           A thrilled intake of breath goes round the table. The writers

           Casey gawps, fascinated.
           Nicholas is following Beth outside. Her agony travels through
           the quiet evening air. The writers are open-mouthed.

           Calm yourself down!

           Is she young?

           For heaven's sake.

                          BETH

           IS SHE?

                          NICHOLAS

           YES!
           The guests are hanging on every word. Beth retreats back into
           the house.

           BETH (O.S.)
           If you leave here tonight to be with
           her... Don't come back.

           Beth...
           For a moment, she hopes he'll apologise.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're making fools of us both.
           Beth, tears stinging, picks a plant out of the tub by the
           door and hurls it, roots and all. It's a direct hit.

                          BETH
           Liar.
           Glen cringes. Beth slams the door.
           Nicholas wipes soil off his glasses; brushes it off his
           shirt. He realises with a sinking heart that he must pass the
           writers to get to his car.

           Nicholas still at the door, listening. 

                          EUSTACIA 
           She even came up with the name Dr 
           Inchcombe. 

                          DIGGORY

           I hope she takes him to the fucking

           Nicholas walks to his car. Silence. He roars away. 

                         

          20C INT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 20C

           Beth comes into the kitchen. Her eyes flicker over pictures
           of her daughter and Nicholas. She is in shock.

           At the end of the day, this is why

           Nicholas is walking Nadia to his car. 

                          NADIA
           Thought you weren't going to come.

                          NICHOLAS
           I was busy. Rowing with my wife.

                          NADIA
           Where are we going?

                          NICHOLAS
           Home.

                          NADIA
           To your farm?
           A look of frustration crosses his face. He turns to her. 

                          NICHOLAS
           We could have gone on just as we
           were.

                          NADIA
           But you said you wanted to be with
           me...

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes. In London. Now and then.
           Nadia looks at him. The scales are beginning to fall. They
           get in the car. As they drive away, Tamara's car pulls up. 
           She gets out of the car and takes in the pub before entering.

                          TAMARA
           Don't know. Just one.
          Zoe pours the wine. She's disarmingly friendly. 

                          ZOE
           You here on business?

                          TAMARA
           No. Business of a kind.

                          ZOE
           I don't mean to pry; I'm just
           really nosey.

                          TAMARA
           I'm from here. Sort of.

                          ZOE
           Nice place.
          Tamara smiles her disagreement.

                          ZOE (CONT'D)
           I keep meaning to leave but... Hard
           to get away.

                          TAMARA
           My mum's house is just up the road.

                          ZOE
           You're not staying with her?

                          TAMARA
           She's. She died.
          Zoe finishes pouring the wine.

                          ZOE
           Have that on me. And here's your
           key. Up the stairs, right in front.
           You can't miss it.
          Tamara utters her thanks, surprised at Zoe's kindness. She
          takes her drink and the key upstairs. Zoe remains, grinning.
          We see why.
          Andy Cobb has just walked in. Zoe pulls him a pint.

                          ZOE (CONT'D)

           Marriage. Remind me never to try it.

           Andy, you're just a sex object. No

          24 INT. NIGHT. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. TAMARA'S BATHROOM 24

           Tamara is in a deep bubble bath. She glances at herself in
           the mirror, scrutinising her beauty. She fingers her nose.
           Slowly a look of doubt steals over her - as if she's not
           quite comfortable in her own skin.

                         

          25 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 25

           Glen is eating his breakfast looking at all the Hardiment's
           family memorabilia in the kitchen. Andy is eating toast. 

                          GLEN
           So the Hardiments have lived here
           centuries, huh?

                          ANDY
           No, `bout twenty years. Still
           strangers by local standards.
           Beth comes in, tense, anxious and haggard.

                          BETH
           Andy, come and look at Ingrid. I
           think she's coming into heat.
           She goes out.

                          GLEN
           She's a nice lady.

                          ANDY
           Yeah, I owe her a lot.

                          GLEN

           wanker. 

                          GLEN 
           That's good. We might even call him 
           a Fuck.

                          ANDY
           That's good too.

                         

          26 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE CHICKEN RUN. 26

           Andy approaches Beth. She is cleaning out the hen coop with
           all the frenetic energy of an abandoned wife.

                          BETH
           This is going rotten underneath.

                          ANDY
           Shall we look at Ingrid?

                          BETH
           It's falling apart.

                          ANDY
           I can do that. Beth...
           Andy takes the shovel. Beth bites back tears.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           He won't last five minutes.
           Beth looks down embarrassed by (but grateful for) his
           support.

                         

          26A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. 26A

           Glen wanders into Beth's office. The wall in front of him is 
           dominated by a framed newspaper profile of Nicholas, 
           surrounded by framed covers of Inchcombe books. The whole 
           room is a shrine to Nicholas' career. 
           Glen is in the hall looking at Beth's prints and pictures; 
           old maps, wildlife and framed letters from grateful writers 
           who have stayed at the retreat. He stares at a print of farm 
           workers in the nineteenth century. Glen sighs. 

           GLEN (V.O.)
           I know why I'm drawn to Thomas 
           Hardy. He writes about failure 
           better than anyone else. I need 
           this book to go well. I need a tiny 
           reward for my endeavours... 
           His stomach gurgles ominously.

          28 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM 28

           Glen walks down the corridor by the kitchen, to the
           downstairs cloakroom; a marvellous Victorian toilet of
           reassuring size. He shuts the door in relief.

                         

          29 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE HALL/DOWNSTAIRS CLOAKROOM. 29

           Glen is on the loo. Even in this small room there are framed
           photographs of Nicholas receiving awards. He looks at them in
           wonder.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           If that's the way you feel...
           Nadia, I'm devastated.
           Through the frosted window Glen sees Nicholas.

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           But if that's your decision, I'll
           have to learn to live with it.
           Beth comes in from the garden. Glen sees Nicholas quickly end
           the call. For Beth's benefit:

                          NICHOLAS
           (Into his phone)
           I told you. I love my wife. Don't
           ever phone me again.
           Glen is shocked by this duplicity.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           No don't touch me, don't you dare.
           Glen panics, realising their reunion is going to be right by
           the door. He puts his hand on the flush, hoping to warn them
           - too late.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.

                          BETH
           Not good enough. Not any more.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.

                          BETH
           You do what you like and then you're
           sorry?

           NICHOLAS (O.S.)
           I hate myself. I hate myself.
          Glen opens the door a chink. They are feet away from him.
          Nicholas looks unshaven, shagged and guilty.

                          BETH
           Where were you?

                          NICHOLAS
           Drove her back to London. Took all
           night.

                          BETH
           You drove her home?

                          NICHOLAS
           She was in a state.

           Do you think she'll get over it?...
           Nicholas shrugs. To Glen's horror, he starts to cry.

                          NICHOLAS
           I'm sorry.
           Then Beth is sobbing too. They are in each other's arms,
           holding each other.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           I don't know why I'm like this. I
           couldn't do without you.
           Glen looks away from the clinch, horribly embarrassed. He
           opens the toilet window, puts the soap dish straight. Looks
           again - still hugging, sobbing, kissing - puts his hand on
           the flush - too awful to reveal himself - takes it off again.
           Straightens his hair, examines his teeth, sweating.
           He looks again. At last the emotion is abating. Nicholas
           releases Beth. She wipes her eyes.

                          BETH
           I've got to go to the bottle bank.

                          NICHOLAS
           OK... Let's talk later.

                          BETH
           Yes. The goat's come into heat.

                          NICHOLAS
           Has it?

                          BETH
           I love you so much.

                          NICHOLAS
           Me too.
           Beth goes. Nicholas is watching her; his expression strange.
           He walks away. At last Glen emerges, incredulous at Nicholas'
           lies.

                          GLEN
           I've just seen the Hardiments kiss
           and make up.

                          DIGGORY

                          (IRRITATED)
           The hat is on.

                          GLEN
           Looks like she's taking him back.

                          DIGGORY
           When the hat is on, it means don't
           speak.

                          GLEN

                          (WITH IRONY)
           So... Peace is restored.
           The sound of a burglar alarm suddenly blares over the garden.
           Diggory sits up, infuriated.

                         

          32 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LIMBURY). 32

           Glen is following Andy down the hill from Stonefield. The
           cows are too close for Glen's comfort. He hurries through.

                          GLEN
           I don't like cows. I mean really.
           They exude bovine malice.

                          ANDY
           Yeah, these girls are killing
           machines. They don't like Americans
           either.

                          GLEN
           Very funny.

                         

          32A EXT. DAY. FIELD AND COPSE. (LARKHAM) 32A

           Glen and Andy are in the valley between the two farms.

                          ANDY
           It's Winnards Farm. Lady there died
           a while back. Place is empty.

                          GLEN
           You think it's being robbed?

                          ANDY
           Prob'ly just kids. Nothing to do
           round here except make trouble.

                          GLEN
           What if it's bad guys? Don't you
           have a blunderbuss or a fowling
           piece or something?
           They climb up through a copse.

                          CUT TO:

          32B EXT. DAY. FIELDS (WINNARDS). 32B

           Glen and Andy are going up the hill towards Winnards.

                          ANDY
           Used to belong to my dad, this
           place.

                          GLEN
           Really?

                          ANDY
           But it all went tits-up. Land was
           flogged to a consortium and the house
           was sold to Londoners; the Drewes.

                          GLEN
           So this is your ancestral pile?

                          ANDY
           Was. Born in that room up there.
           He points up at the back bedroom window.

                          GLEN
           You must have been pretty resentful.

                         

          33 1995. EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE LANE. 33

           An eighteen year old Andy jumps off a stile into the lane
           behind a slim, fifteen year old girl on a horse.

                          ANDY
           Hey.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 21A.

                         

                         
          The girl turns. She has a huge nose.

                          ANDY
           This farm's mine, big nose.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 22.

                         

                         
           The girl kicks the horse into a trot, her nose in the air.

                         

          34 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 34

           Andy and Glen turn the corner to the back of the house.
           Tamara is up a ladder wielding a hammer at the alarm box.

                          ANDY
           Hey, what're you doing?
           Tamara gives the alarm box a great whack.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           Who are you??

                          TAMARA
           Andy, you moron; it's me.
           Andy looks more closely. A disturbing spark of recognition.

                          ANDY
           Tam?... Hardly recognise you. 
           Another whack. The noise becomes a high-pitched squeal.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           You won't do it that way.

                          TAMARA
           Then help me!

                         

          35 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 35

           Andy turns the alarm off. Tamara enters the dusty kitchen.

                          ANDY
           Used to do bits of work for your mum.
           Been keeping an eye on the place
           since she died.

                          TAMARA
           What sort of work, graphics?

                          ANDY
           I do horticulture now.

                          TAMARA
           You're a gardener?
           Andy says nothing. He stares at her nose. Glen has come in.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 23.

                         

                         

                          GLEN
           This is a great old house.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like to buy it?

                          GLEN
           I'm not really the property-owning
           kind. Prefer my life to fit into hand 
           luggage. 

                          ANDY
           That's why you're back, to flog it?

                          TAMARA
           Yes.

                          ANDY
           Make a nice second home for some
           banker wankers.

                          TAMARA
           Andy if you want it, why don't you
           make me an offer?

                          ANDY
           Because sadly I'm still prey to the 
           economic forces that threw the
           peasant classes off the land.

                          TAMARA
           Unlucky.
           Tamara opens a cupboard. It's full of empty wine bottles. 

                          ANDY
           Tam.
           Their eyes meet.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           What the fuck have you done to
           yourself?
           Tamara's face falls.

                         

          36 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 36

           Glen and Andy are walking back. Andy is brooding.

                          ANDY 
           She's completely different. 

                          GLEN 
           How was she before? What's the 
           story?... 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24.

                         

                         

                          ANDY 
           There isn't one. 

                          GLEN 
           Come on. 

                          ANDY 
           Was nothing. Decade ago. Just a 
           teenage thing. 

                         

          37 1996. INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - A SHED. 37 

           Tamara pulling down her pants; Andy unbuttoning his jeans.
           She jumps up on the worktable, pushing a stack of turnips out
           of the way. They kiss passionately.

                          ANDY
           You should find someone you're in
           love with.

                          TAMARA
           You stupid prick.
           Andy looks at her. She is sincere.

                          ANDY
           You saying you love me, frosty tits?

                          TAMARA
           You first.

                          ANDY
           You say it; You're the girl.

                          TAMARA
           Fuck off.
           She kisses him. As they start to make love:

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           I love you. Fuck off. I love you. 

                         

          37A EXT. DAY. A FIELD. 37A 

           Glen looks over at Andy, interrupting his thoughts. 

                          GLEN 
           Romeo and Juliet, huh? 
           Andy carries on down the hill, shaking his head. 

                         

          38 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 38 

           Tamara is watching Andy walk away with Glen. Her eyes follow 
           him curiously - then she firmly turns her back. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 24A.

                         

                         
           Tamara rips a bin liner off the roll and shakes it out.
           She takes a deep breath. She opens the cupboard and begins to
           bin the distressing mountain of empty wine bottles. 

                         

          39 EXT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 39

           Beth is standing at the hedge looking down at the valley with
           Nicholas at her side.

                          BETH
           Thinking of the first time we saw
           this place...

                          NICHOLAS
           You've made it a wonderful home
           Beth.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 25.

                         

                         

                          BETH
           Not wonderful enough.
           She starts to walk away. Nicholas holds her back.

                          NICHOLAS
           If you can't put this behind you,
           then we're stuck.

                          BETH
           Well I'd better sort myself out then. 

                          NICHOLAS
           What has to happen? I am sorry -
           Beth brings her arm up to push him away. Nicholas catches it;
           draws her to him. He kisses her insistently. Beth's
           resistance diminishes. Soon it has gone. We begin to see the
           depth of Beth's physical love for him.
           At that moment, Glen walks round the corner. He tries to
           backtrack, mortified by his intrusion on their passion. Too
           late. They part. Nicholas turns away in frustration.

                          GLEN
           Just taking the air.
           Flustered, he knocks into a tub of lobelias. Beth and
           Nicholas remain. The moment between them is gone. Round the
           corner, Glen is cringing.

           Jody and Casey are reading a celebrity magazine.

           Would you do him?

           No.

           What about him?

           He's gay, you dobbin.

                          JODY
           So?
           They turn to a big spread on a band called Swipe.

           Ben Sergeant...
           I'd walk through fire to do him.

                          CASEY
           The drummer?

                          JODY
           He's not just the drummer. He writes
           the lyrics; it's his band. He's the
           fucking genius, not Steve Culley or
           any of these wankers. It's Ben.

                          CASEY
           OK. I'd do Ben.

                          JODY
           I wanna be her, in that dress with
           him licking my teapot lids.

          42 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 42

           Casey is still carrying this image as she serves a tray of
           nibbles on the patio. She stands among the writers, watching 
           a fly get caught in one of the vol-au-vents.

                          DIGGORY 
           People talk about the muscularity in 
           prose. I want a similar muscularity 
           in my verse. I don't want a poetry 
           that's flabby or obese - that's why I 
           adhere to the tightest rhyme schemes: 
           Diggory picks the vol-au-vent up and without looking, puts it 
           in his mouth. Casey moves over to Nicholas and Glen.

           I wouldn't presume to give an
           academic tips.

                          GLEN
           Matter of fact I read one of your
           books. Another distraction but I
           thought it was decent stuff.

          Nicholas walks away leaving Glen smarting. The female writers
          surround Nicholas. He tops them up, full of charm. Under his
          breath, Glen impersonates:

                          GLEN
           `We call them biscuits, here.'
          Nicholas raises his glass for a toast.

                          NICHOLAS
           To the muse, however you find her.
          He is looking at Beth. She is gratified. Then his eye shifts,
          his glass still in the air.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Who's that?
          Tamara Drewe is climbing the stile at the bottom of the
          garden in a low cut T-shirt, tiny pair of denim shorts and
          bare feet. The evening light bathes her in a golden sheen.

                          GLEN
           That's Tamara Drewe.

                          NICHOLAS
           No it isn't.

                          GLEN
           I met her with Andy.

                          NICHOLAS
           Good God. What's happened to her?

                          POPPY
           She's had a nose job, Dad.

                          NICHOLAS
           She's completely different.

                          GLEN
           That's what Andy said.

                          BETH
           Poor Tamara. Such a sad girl. She
           used to come and help you wash the
           car, didn't she Nicholas? I think
           she liked a bit of family after her
           dad left.

                          TESS
           Is that Tamara Drewe who writes the
           column in one of the Sundays?

                          BETH
           Used to. Writes for the Independent
           now.

                          TESS
           She spent weeks going on about her
           nose job. Smart way to pay for it I
           suppose. Was her old one an awful
           conk?

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes.

                          BETH
           She's poured herself into those
           shorts. I hope they don't give her
           thrush.

                          TESS
           What's the etiquette with nose
           jobs? Do we mention it, or...
          Tamara has arrived in earshot. Absolutely everyone, including
          a very curious Casey, is staring at her nose.

                          TAMARA
           Hello. Sorry to intrude.
          Her hand defensively brushes her nose. Poppy walks towards
          her, full of warmth.

                          POPPY
           Hey, Tamara.

                          TAMARA
           Poppy, how are you?

                          POPPY
           Love your new hooter.

                          TAMARA
           Thanks. It isn't actually new; just
           smaller...

           At last Beth remembers her manners.

                          BETH
           Tamara, so sorry about your mum.

                          TAMARA
           Thank you...

                          BETH
           Are you staying down for a while?

                          TAMARA
           I'll have to. There's so much to be
           done.

                          BETH
           You must let us know if we can help.

                          TAMARA
           Actually, I was going to ask if you
           could spare a pair of strong arms.
           I've got a skip coming tomorrow and -

                          BETH
           Nicholas? -
           Nicholas is opening another bottle of prosecco. It pops its
           cork over his trousers. He mutters a swear word.

                          GLEN
           I'm available. I do skips.

                          DIGGORY
           I... No.

                          TAMARA
           Well thank you. You're very kind...
           Is Andy around at all?
           Beth is helping Nicholas wipe his trousers.

                          BETH
           Oh, I can't spare Andy. He's making
           a new coop for my Buff Orpingtons.

                         

          43 EXT. NEXT DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 43

           Tamara and Glen are carrying junk out to a skip. Tamara is in
           big boots and a slightly more practical pair of shorts.

          44 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 44

           Beth is preparing lunch, talking to Poppy. Nicholas is going 
           through his typed-up manuscript; not really listening.

                          BETH
           She's had the writers down there 
           helping her all day. I hope she 
           realises they're here to work... 

                          POPPY
           Can't believe what a difference 
           her nose makes. 

                          BETH
           Well I think it's a mistake; taken
           away all her character.

                          POPPY
           Come on; she looks ten times
           better.

                          NICHOLAS
           Huh. 

                          BETH
           And she knows it. I found those
           shorts really irritating. Going
           around with half her bum hanging
           out. I mean, why?

                          POPPY 
           To annoy people like you. Might get a
           pair myself.

                          NICHOLAS
           Of course you won't.

                          POPPY
           Why not?

                          NICHOLAS
           Because you're not desperate, are
           you? Always something a bit
           desperate about Tamara Drewe.
           Beth looks at him puzzled as he works on.

                         

          45 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 45

           Tamara and Glen are having a rest.

                          GLEN
           So why did you change your face?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 30A.

                         

                         

                          TAMARA 
          Changing my face is the best thing I
          ever did. And I don't care what 
          anyone thinks. 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 31.

                         

                         

                          GLEN
           Would it work for me? 

                          TAMARA
           Maybe; if you did the wrinkles too.

                          GLEN
           Oh, you're just coming on to me...
           Tamara laughs. She starts work again.

                          GLEN
           In your column, you write about 
           yourself... Does that come easily? 

                          TAMARA
           No... But it feels right. My first 
           novel's definitely going to be
           autobiographical.

                          GLEN
           Your first novel? You're going to
           dash one off just like that?

                          TAMARA
           Ideally, I'd like to make it into 
           fiction before I'm thirty.

                          GLEN
           And then maybe a swimwear collection,
           a chat show, a pasta sauce range?

                          TAMARA
           What? 

                          GLEN
           Life sure is easy for the beautiful.

                          TAMARA 
           You know before I got the nose job 
           I had no trouble getting taken 
           seriously. Maybe, when they removed 
           that bit of cartilage, they pulled 
           my brain out by mistake - what do 
           you think? 
           Glen smiles, won over. 

                         

          46 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 46

           Glen is coming from the bar with a pint for Andy and a half
           for himself. He has just been served by Zoe.

                          GLEN
           She's single, man.
           Andy looks over at Zoe.

                          ANDY
          Well it's not exactly a
          relationship; we just have an
          occasional thing. Zoe doesn't want
          to be tied down and -

                          GLEN
          Not Zoe! Tamara... You should get
          in there. Marry the girl. Then you
          get to live back in your ancestral
          home.

                          ANDY
          No way. Not her type.

                          GLEN
          The trouble is Andy, you think like
          a loser. And I know that because
          I'm the loser that losers turn to
          for tips. I'm the losers loser.

                          ANDY
           I'm a pedigree loser. I had a
           graphics business; went bust. And
           then with my great business acumen
           I invested in a polytunnel full of
           ganja.

                          GLEN
           Wow. How'd that go?

                          ANDY
           Made a tit of myself. Spent about
           six years stoned out of my box and
           I'm only just getting it back
           together. Besides, even if I was
           the last man in the world, Tamara
           Drewe wouldn't have me.

                          GLEN
           Why not?

                          ANDY
           I dumped her.

                          GLEN
           Oh, you are a loser.

                          ANDY
           I was twenty. My mates thought I
           was cradle snatching... And they
           used to call her Beaky.

                         

          47 1996. EXT. DAY. OUTSIDE THE PUB. 47

           Tamara in her school uniform, is gutted.

                          TAMARA
           Beaky?...
           We see her stricken face as she turns away. Then she turns
           back and hits Andy. His nose streams blood.

                         

          48 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - THE PUB. 48

           Glen is preparing to leave.

                          GLEN
           You told her the truth... The time
           might come when she respects that.
           Andy, as your love guru, I suggest
           you ask Tamara for a date. But take a
           shower first, OK?

          49 EXT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 49

           Tamara is in her shorts and boots, chucking empty bottles and
           old saucepans into the skip, like an Amazon.

                         

          50 EXT. EVENING. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 50

           Nicholas is at the hedge, looking down the valley towards
           Winnards Farm. He is watching Tamara like a hawk - as if he
           can't quite believe what he is seeing.

                         

          51 1996. EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 51 

           Nicholas and Tamara are polishing Nicholas' car. 

                          TAMARA 
           Boys know nothing. 
           Nicholas looks up at her, smiles indulgently. Tamara stops 
           work. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           I've been reading `Inchcombe's 
           Dose.' 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Have you? 

                          TAMARA 
           The bit where Doctor Inchcombe 
           finds himself having thoughts about 
           the dead guy's daughter. 
           Tamara walks around the car, bringing her polishing cloth 
           closer to his. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           You describe her light smattering 
           of freckles and her striking 
           profile. So... 
           She turns her head. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           Who did you base her on? 

                          NICHOLAS 
           What? 

                          TAMARA 
           Have you noticed me? 
           Nicholas looks at her in surprise. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D) 
           Because I've noticed you... 

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 33A.

                         

                         
          She waits, hoping for a kiss, a hug, anything. She puts out a 
          hand - almost touches him. He steps back. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Think it's time you went. 
          Tamara is mortified. 

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D) 
           You're making yourself ridiculous. 
          This really hurts. Tamara takes the bucket of soapy water and 
          throws it over the car - and Nicholas. 

                          TAMARA 
           Nicholarse.

           Nicholas is still staring at Tamara, who is jumping on the
           stuff in the skip. Glen is strolling up the hill from the
           pub. He follows Nicholas' gaze.

                          GLEN
           A man can dream, huh?
           Nicholas looks at him affronted - as if he doesn't know what
           he's talking about.

                         

          53 INT. EVENING. WINNARDS FARM. 53

           Tamara, hot and dirty, runs up the stairs with her roll of
           bin liners. She opens the door to her mother's bedroom.
           She is completely unprepared for it. A neat, womanly room
           covered in photographs of Tamara as a child, teen and young
           woman. On the dressing table is a lipstick; the lid lying
           next to it as if it has just been used. Tamara picks it up.
           She sits, suddenly exhausted. For the first time, she looks
           lost.

                         

          54 EXT. DAY. ANOTHER FARM - THE GOAT PEN. 54

           Tamara still looks slightly shaken as she walks up to Andy.
           He is watching Ingrid meet Darcy, a billy goat.

                          ANDY
           Go on Ingrid; have some kids.

                          TAMARA
           Pretty direct isn't he? He's not
           even bought her a coke.
           Andy turns. Sees her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           And he stinks.

                          ANDY
           She doesn't mind; it's like Lynx to
           her. If she's ready she'll stand for
           him, if not she won't.

                          TAMARA
           That's disturbing human.

                          ANDY
           Refreshing basic.
           Darcy is up and at it.

                          ANDY (CONT'D)
           Thought you'd have gone back to
           London by now.

                          TAMARA
           I wish. Looks like I'm stuck here for
           a while. Actually, I've got a
           proposition for you.
          Andy glances at the goats; bad idea.

                          ANDY
           We should go for a drink
           sometime, Tam. You know, for old
           times sake.

                          TAMARA
           So we can reminisce about how I
           smashed your nose?

                          ANDY
           You didn't smash it.

                          TAMARA
           Yes I did.

                          ANDY
           It just bled.
          The memory is between them.

                          TAMARA
           I've got to do the house up before I
           sell it. It looks like an eighties
           timewarp. Would you like the job?
          He just looks at her.

                          TAMARA
           Painting it and tidying the garden?
           Good hourly rate.

                          ANDY
           It can't be easy down there, Tam.

                          TAMARA
           What d'you mean?

                          ANDY
           All the memories and stuff. Your
           mum...

                          TAMARA
           I'm fine.

                          ANDY
          Is it that you want someone around?
          Like when you look up I'd be there
          too?

                          TAMARA
           Jesus Christ, the goats are giving

                          YOU IDEAS

                          ANDY
           OK it's bollocks -

                          TAMARA
           That's very sweet of you Andy -

                          ANDY
           Of course you wouldn't want to
           fraternise with your gardener.

                          TAMARA
           So... is that a yes?
           Andy doesn't reply.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Come on, goat whisperer - I thought
           I'd be doing you a favour. I thought
           you needed the work.
           It's all over with Ingrid and Darcy.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           She's had a shit time but she'll
           still call him. He'll lose her
           number. He won't ring her back...
           Andy's face cracks into a smile. He is won over.

                         

          54A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 54A 

           Glen types a sentence. He reads it. He deletes. He stares at 
           the blank page. It stares back at him. 

                          GLEN 
           No. 
           He stands. He paces. He sits. 

                          GLEN 
           Just write, you numbskull. You 
           moron, you dumb fuck - write! 

                         

          55 EXT./INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - BETH'S OFFICE. 55

           Glen is passing Beth's office. She's working through a stack
           of fan mail. She smiles when she sees him.

                          BETH
           How's Thomas Hardy?
           Glen unburdens himself.

                          GLEN
           I'm wasting my sabbatical.

           Oh dear.

                          GLEN
           I've been working on this book
           forever; why can't I finish it? I'm
           two years past my delivery date and
           Fantail could ask for their
           chickenshit advance back. I can't
           write. I'm fucking constipated.
           It's a disaster.

           Is this all his fan mail?

                          BETH
           I do a couple of sessions a week,
           to keep on top of it. Pretty good
           at forging Nick's signature.
           Glen looks awed - and defeated.

                          BETH 
           Would you like me to read it? 

                          GLEN 
           You'd do that? 

                          BETH 
           Be glad to. If you think it would 
           help. 
           Beth suddenly sees Andy out of the window. He's leaving.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           Sorry Glen. Just need Andy -

                          GLEN

           Beth catches up with Andy.

                          BETH
           If you're going into Hadditon -
           we're really low on chicken feed.

                          ANDY
           I'll get it tomorrow. I'm on my way
           down to Winnards. Doing one or two
           jobs for Tamara.

                          BETH
           She's got you helping her too?

                          ANDY
           Just painting, decorating, sorting
           the garden.
           Beth is quite put out.

                          BETH
           Andy, that sounds like a lot. I
           need you here.

                          ANDY
           I can easily do both.

                          BETH
           As long as you're not working for
           her in the hours that I pay you.
          Without thinking, she has made Andy feel like a servant.

                          ANDY
           Sure, Beth. I won't rip you off.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 38.

                         

                         
           He walks on, leaving Beth feeling very uncomfortable - and
           somehow slightly bereft.

                         

          57 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GROUNDS / KITCHEN. 57

           Andy comes in. He shouts into the house.

                          ANDY
           Tam? Got some colour charts for you
           to see.
           He sets out all the colours charts and plans he has been 
           working on. Tamara appears. She is dressed to kill. 

                          TAMARA 
           What would you choose for in here? 

                          ANDY 
           Well... I'd have this one. And then 
           upstairs in the bedroom - 

                          TAMARA 

           OK. 
           She starts gathering her things. 

                          ANDY 
           So what d'you have to do to get a
           cup of tea round here?

                          TAMARA
           Make it.

                          (SHE POINTS)
           Tea bags. Sugar. Fridge.

                          (SHE GRINS)
           I'm off to work.
           Andy stares. Suddenly Tamara is no longer just a blast from
           the past. He sees a future - a future that he wants. He
           slowly smiles back - but she's already striding away.

                         

          58 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE PERIMETER FENCE. 58

           Pounding rock music, slightly distorted by distance. Jody and
           Casey are trying to get in over the boundary fence. A
           security guard is already running towards them.

                          JODY
           This is our village. Our fucking
           field.

                          JODY

           COME ON YOU BASTARD LET US IN!
           Jody is ready for a fight but Casey pulls her back.

          59 CUT. 59

                         

          60 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS 60

           Beth is tending to Ingrid - making sure she's not scared by
           the noise. Ingrid looks as if she couldn't give a damn. Over
           by the barn she sees Glen, unaware that he's being watched,
           breaking out of a mournful walk to groove to the music. She
           smiles.
           At the other end of the farm, Nicholas is staring over the
           hedge with tissue paper ear-plugs. He pretends his arm is a
           rifle, like a little boy. He aims at the cows. He fires.

                         

          61 EXT. DAY. A ROCK FESTIVAL - THE MAIN STAGE. 61

           Swipe are playing; bit like The Libertines in their prime.
           There is one girl in the band, bass guitarist Fran Redford.
           The drummer, Ben Sergeant, is also vocals. The lead singer,
           Steve Culley, is mixed-race; confident and charismatic.
           He is getting very up-close and personal with Fran. Ben is
           getting more and more furious.
           In the wings, we see Tamara talking to a publicist, trying to
           make herself heard above the roar of the music. She is
           pointing at Steve and Fran. The publicist nods.
           Suddenly Ben leaps up and takes hold of Steve, pulling him
           away from Fran. There is a scuffle, Fran trying to separate
           the boys. Ben takes a microphone.

                          BEN
           Sorry people. I resign. Swipe is no
           more. Steve Culley is a cunt.
           Ben storms off the stage. The audience are in uproar.

                          PUBLICIST
           Ben! Ben! What's happening?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 40.

                         

                         

                          BEN
           He's seeing Fran. I won't work with
           that tosser again.

                          FRAN
           Steve! Don't!
           Steve is coming into the wings. He punches Ben.

                          STEVE
           You fucking baby.
           Ben falls. He virtually lands on Tamara. They both hit the
           ground. Steve storms off - Fran following, calling his name.
           Ben is dazed. He looks up at Tamara.

                          TAMARA
           Hello. I'm Tamara Drewe.

                          BEN
           What?

                          TAMARA
           I'm supposed to be interviewing you
           - for the Independent.
           She smiles sweetly, smoothing his hair.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           It was scheduled for later but
           maybe now's a better time...

                         

          62 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. EWEDOWN - BUS SHELTER. 62

           Jody, Casey and the boys are sharing a bottle of cider.

                          JODY
           They should let us in free.

                          RYAN
           Too right. They come here, drink our
           water, use our fields, they leave
           all their crap in our drains -
           Tamara's car sweeps past with the roof down. It is closely
           followed by a bright yellow Porsche. Ben is driving and his
           boxer dog, Boss, is in the passenger seat. Jody clocks him.

                          JODY
           Ben! Ben!
           She jumps up and down in the road with both arms waving.

           Jody and Casey scream with delight, chasing the car.

                         

          63 EXT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM. 63

           Ben skids his Porsche to a halt right next to Tamara's car.
           He jumps out. Boss follows. Tamara is walking towards the
           door. The distant festival is still audible. Tamara backs
           towards the door, with Ben inches away.

                          BEN
           That's Boss.

                          TAMARA
           Hi Boss.

                          BEN
           You're not allergic are you?

                          TAMARA
           To indie drummers? Maybe. Who are
           your influences, Ben?

                          BEN
           Everyone asks that. This your place?

                          TAMARA
           I'm selling. D'you want it?

                          BEN
           No, I want something else.
           Tamara grins. Jody and Casey arrive at the brow of the hill,
           breathless. They see Ben pin Tamara against the door.

                          JODY
           Who the fuck's she?

                          CASEY
           I seen her up at Stonefield. She's
           got a nose made of plastic.

                          JODY
           How come she gets Ben? I've loved
           him since March.
           Just as Ben's about to kiss her, Tamara coolly opens the door
           and draws him into the house.

                          CASEY
           Wow...
           Jody is gutted; feeling the full injustice of her life.

          64 INT. LATE AFTERNOON. WINNARDS FARM - KITCHEN 64

           Tamara leads Ben to the kitchen. The hall has been stripped.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like a beer?

                          BEN
           Yep. Maureen Tucker.

                          TAMARA
           Who?
           Tamara opens the fridge. Ben is inches away. He still hasn't
           kissed her and he's just about to.

                          BEN
           Moe Tucker, with the Velvets. Five
           foot nothing. Used to stand up to
           play. Put the snare drum on its side
           and hit it with mallets. Mentalist.

                          TAMARA
           You write all the songs; that's
           pretty rare for a drummer.

                          BEN
           Everything you've ever heard about
           drummers is total shit.

                          TAMARA
           You mean you don't spontaneously
           combust?

                          BEN
           Only sometimes.
           She goes in to kiss him. But Ben grabs a pair of chopsticks
           from a utensils jar. He starts to play around Tamara, hitting
           the surfaces, the shelves and everything on them; a brilliant
           rhythm. He gets closer and closer. Tamara is utterly
           mesmerised. Ben stops. He still doesn't kiss her.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Any more questions?
           Tamara is speechless. He kisses her.

                          65
           Andy is walking in the copse up to Tamara's. He spots a
           couple of wild mushrooms and picks them. In the distance he
           sees Glen bending and stretching. A cow is looking at him
           over the fence. Glen sees it and startles.

           The sight makes Andy smile. He carries on towards Winnards
           Farm in high spirits.

                         

          66 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 66

           Andy comes up to the house. He sees the yellow Porsche; then
           a large boxer dog sitting by the front garden. It starts
           barking at him. Andy calms him right down.

                          ANDY
           Hey, hey - who are you, mate -
           lost, are you?
           Andy strokes Boss.

           Andy takes a key from under a flower pot.

           Andy opens the kitchen door.

                          ANDY
           Tam? You want breakfast?
           Boss bounds inside and disappears.

                          ANDY

                          WOAH -
           Andy is puzzled. He steps into the hall.

                          ANDY
           Do you know about this dog, Tam -
           He notices two half-drunk beers. He wanders into the hall. He
           sees Ben's boots and most of Tamara's clothes, abandoned. The
           unmistakable moans of lovemaking are coming from Tamara's
           room.
           He turns on his heels, pained.

                         

          67 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD. (WINNARDS). 67

           Andy strides back across the field, chucking the mushrooms in
           the mud on his way.

           Two cars parked - Tamara's and the yellow Porsche, which 
           looks more like a permanent fixture. The garden has been 
           cleared and dug, ready to plant. 
           Andy is stoking a bonfire. He is smouldering like the embers. 
           He gives the yellow Porsche an angry look.

           Nicholas and Glen are both walking in the field. They pass 
           each other, each managing a painful smile.

           Their smiles fade. Nicholas descending into deep gloom, Glen 
           into deep anxiety.

           Beth is mending the engine of her huge mower. Glen, now
           wearing a scarf, is sitting on the seat watching her work.

                          GLEN
           It's his most obscure novel `The Well-
           Beloved'. Most people have never even
           heard of it. About this guy of twenty
           who falls in love with a beautiful
           young woman. Then when he's forty, he
           meets the woman's daughter and he
           falls in love with her. And finally,
           when he's sixty he meets the

                          GRANDDAUGHTER -

                          BETH
           Oh he doesn't.

                          GLEN
           Yeah. Falls in mystical love. Hardy
           was like that in his life, too. Even
           as he aged, he only had eyes for
           young women. Like, in one essential
           way he never grew up.

                          BETH
           In his trousers.

                          GLEN
           He was still at it in his eighties.
           You know? Snow on the rooftop but
           fire in the cellar...

                          BETH
           Why won't it come for you Glen?
           The way you talk about it's so
           engaging.

                          GLEN
           Yeah but there's an academic style,
           you know?

                          BETH
           Who are you writing for? Who's your
           ideal reader?

           Glen can't answer.

                          BETH
           Because if you wrote the way you
           spoke... it would make me want to
           read Hardy.

                          GLEN
           Really?

                          BETH
           Yes. If you wrote like you were
           talking to a friend... Pass me that
           thing.
           Glen passes it, looking at Beth as she tightens a bolt.

                          BETH
           Try it now.
           Glen turns the key. The engine starts. Glen starts to drive
           the mower, delighted. Beth watches him, amused.

           A cosy dinner for all the writers - more ladies in their
           forties and fifties. Nicholas is topping up his glass.

                          NICHOLAS
           I simply pander to popular taste.

                          CAITLIN
           Oh your books are far more than that.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just airport fodder...
           Glen at the foot of the table, finds this modesty rich.

                          CAITLIN
           Your prose is so vivid. And Inchcombe
           - for all his flaws - is a man with
           total integrity.

                          GLEN
           Who did you base him on, Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS

                          (IGNORING GLEN)
           My books don't say anything
           profound. I can't pretend to be an
           intellectual - not like Glen here,
           illuminating our ignorance with his
           critical glow - but I do love prose.
           And I think I can turn a reasonable
           story.
          Glen peers into the kitchen. Beth is serving desserts.

                          GLEN
           Excuse me.
          He goes to help her, leaving the ladies around Nicholas like
          cups around a teapot.

                          GLEN
           Let me help.

                          BETH
           They need dusting with this.

                          GLEN
           I went to my room and I wrote for
           three hours. The time just
           vanished.

                          BETH
           That's great, that's brilliant.

                          GLEN
           I feel like a man who's just passed
           a gargantuan stool.

                          BETH
           Super. Sprig of mint on the top.
          Glen returns to the dining room with two desserts. He listens
          to Nicholas as he serves them.

                          NICHOLAS
           The real secret of being a writer
           is learning how to lie.
          A frisson of shock goes round the lady writers.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Because that's what storytellers
           are. Thieves and liars...

                          GLEN

           Do it later. Play with me.
           Ben strums his guitar, determined to get her attention.

           She is such fun she's sexy
           And she lives on an old farm
           But something gnaws away at me
           It's causing me real harm.

           bagging a bone fide rock star. She
           was such an ugly duckling. She must
           be thrilled to bits.

           Andy peers through the door. Zoe is setting tables. He
           knocks. Zoe let's him in.

                          ZOE
           We're not open for another hour.

           Andy and Zoe are in the near-darkness, making love against

           Andy is lying on one of the seats, his head on Zoe's lap.

           I'm going to move on soon, Andy.

           Don't know if I can stick a winter
           here. The way the light disappears;
           it's doing me in. I'm a blue sky
           girl. Got to have some warmth.
           Andy just looks up at her, smiling his understanding.

                          ANDY
           We all need a bit of that, don't we.

                         

          76AA EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 76AA 

           Boss is outside, sniffing round the front door. Sounds of the 
           end of an epic shag from the upstairs window. He sits, bored. 
           He hears the noise of crows in the field. 
           He is off like a shot.

           Boss is having the time of his life chasing the cows. Penny
           Upminister, an uppercrust landowner in a horrible coat is
           trying to catch him.

           The whole herd is now on the rampage, Boss in pursuit, Penny 
           bringing up the rear. Nicholas sees them heading straight for 
           his shed.

           Tamara is opening a Tiffany's box. There is a ring inside it.
           She looks at Ben, almost in disbelief. Boss can be heard,
           barks fading in the distance.

                          TAMARA
           What's this?

                          BEN
           What's it look like?

           Ben... For which finger?

                          BEN
           Whatever one you like. That's a
           nice one. Why not put it on that?
           He's pointing to her ring finger. Tamara is moved.

           Penny Upminister has managed to get Boss on a bit of rope.
           She is handing him over to Beth at the top of the field.

           Calm down, Penny. I'll sort him out.
           Nicholas is approaching.

                          PENNY
           It beats me why you people want to
           live in the country. You've got no
           sense of responsibility.

                          BETH
           It's not our dog!

                          NICHOLAS
           Hello, Penny. How's tricks?
           Penny is suddenly all coy.

                          PENNY
           Oh - Nicholas...

                          NICHOLAS
           You're looking great. Terrific coat.

                          PENNY
           What, this old thing?

                          NICHOLAS
           You look like royalty.

                          PENNY
           (laughs, delighted)
           Well, I try... Can't wait for your
           next book. Inchcombe's such a sauce-
           pot. Giles is always says `What are
           you reading Penny? You've got steam
           coming out of your ears...'
           She laughs like a drain. Nicholas joins in. Beth is striding
           away with the dog, infuriated.

                         

          80 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM 80

           Ben has put a ring on Tamara's finger.

                          TAMARA
           So what's the ring saying, Ben?

                          BEN
           It's saying hello I'm a ring. Will
           you marry me?
           Tamara looks at him, searchingly.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What's up?

                          TAMARA
           That you were in love with me.

                          BEN
           The ring says I'm platinum with a
           long guarantee. So give me a reply.
           Tamara is grinning from ear to ear.

                          TAMARA
           You're the best fun in the world.
           I'd love to marry you.
           She throws her arms around his neck.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Can I say it then?

                          BEN
           Say what?

                          TAMARA
           I love you.
           Tamara holds him, profoundly affected. Something akin to fear
           flickers across Ben's eyes. The phone rings.

                          BEN

                          (ANSWERING IT)

           Ben's Porsche skids to a halt, music blaring. Diggory is 
           looking on in irate astonishment. The hat is on. 

                          BETH
           Shhh! There are writers here, trying
           to write.
           Beth is in the hen enclosure, a hen in her arms.

           This is a Buff Orpington. She's 
           looking a bit peaky today. Not a 
           great layer but she's very 
           decorative. 
           Beth puts down the hen. 

                          BETH 
           We're fully organic - but I like to 
           think that our champion product is

          Ben just about manages to shake it.

           Swipe's over. Thought the whole
           world knew that.

                          NICHOLAS
           It wasn't on Newsnight, no.

                          BETH
           Ben is engaged to Tamara. Isn't
           that lovely? He'd just popped the
           question when I rang.

                          NICHOLAS
           She said yes?
          Nicholas can't hide his disbelief. Ben is insulted.

                          BETH
           We're delighted for you both.
          Boss leaps up, straining against a chain.

                          BEN
           Why's he on a chain?

                          BETH
           He was out of control.

                          BEN
           How'd you like to be chained up?

                          BETH
           He was chasing livestock. He
           could've got shot.

                          BEN
           They shoot him; I'll fucking shoot
           them. 
          He takes Boss. Beth and Nicholas are left alone.

                          NICHOLAS
           I think the word is gobshite.

                          BETH
           I hope he makes her happy. It's hard
           for girls when their dads walk out.
           Gives them bad taste in men.

                          NICHOLAS

                          BETH
           Just saying her father left when she
           was a girl and -

                          NICHOLAS
           That is ten pence psychology! You
           don't know what you're talking
           about, do you? 
           He walks away. Beth is completely taken aback.

                         

          82 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - NICHOLAS' SHED/ EXT. WINNARDS 82

           Nicholas, wearing a woolly hat and scarf, is writing.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.)
           Patel's eyes were open, eloquent in
           death...
           He looks up. In the distance, he can just see Tamara talking
           to Andy in the garden at Winnards Farm.
           Nicholas opens his desk. He finds a pair of old binoculars.
           He focuses them on Tamara. She holds out her hand with the
           ring on it. Andy has his arms wrapped around himself, his
           shoulders hunched. He nods, affecting congratulations.
           Nicholas tries to close in on Tamara. But she turns and goes
           indoors. Also the yellow Porsche arrives. Nicholas puts the
           binoculars down.

           NICHOLAS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He knelt down - forensics be damned -
           and closed her eyes, forever.

           Ben realises his mistake. Tamara laughs, shocked.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Was this for someone else?
           Ben shrugs, not wanting to admit. The truth dawns.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           You gave it to Fran didn't you?

                          BEN
           So? It's yours now. She never wore
           it. She didn't want it.

                          TAMARA
           You asked her to marry you...?

                          BEN
           It was a gesture, OK, when she
           started seeing Steve. Backfired,
           anyway. Look, I love you now.
           Tamara doesn't believe him. She is devastated.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           It's not the ring that matters. I
           mean fuck the ring. It's just a
           consumerist piece of zinc. What
           matters is I want to marry you.

                          TAMARA
           Do you?

                          BEN
           Yeah. With my whole heart. And all
           the other stuff. Like my brain and my
           entrails and my whatever, pancreas.
           It all wants to marry you.
           He hugs her, starts kissing her but Tamara hardly responds.

           Nicholas is staring out at the darkness. Beth is organising

                          BETH
           She wondered if you had a delivery

           Mind that cocoa, it's hot.
           Across at Winnards, Tamara's bedroom light comes on. For a
           moment, she gazes out. Nicholas gazes back.

           And Tim wants to know if you'll do

           Nicholas stares out into the darkness. He isn't working. He

           Mud, frost and gloom add to the sense of neglect. Jody is

                          JODY
           She been sitting on a bead car-seat
           or what?
           Casey turns a page.

                          CASEY
           `Her latest tattoo count was nine,
           including a Sumatran tiger and
           `Eternity' written in Sanskrit.'

                          JODY
           She'll be getting a barcode done
           next. Right across there.

                          CASEY
          Nice baby though. I'd like one that
          colour.

           Jody chucks her fag-end into the bin.

                         

          87 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN - THE BUS SHELTER - FIVE MINUTES LATER. 87

           The bin is on fire. Casey chucks in the Pringles box. They
           warm their hands, watching one of the boys wheelie his bike
           and fall off right into a freezing puddle. Casey giggles.

                          CASEY
           That Ryan...

                          JODY
           What a dick.

                          CASEY
           I think he's cute.

                          JODY
           No you don't. Would you snog him?

                          CASEY
           Maybe.

                          JODY
           Be like having a slug in your mouth.
           Ben's yellow Porsche speeds right through the puddle, further
           soaking Ryan. Ben and Tamara are both wearing designer shades
           despite the gloom; Boss in the back.
           Jody and Casey are both on their feet in a second.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben! Ben!

                          CASEY

           BEN!!!

                          RYAN
           Wankers.
           Ben gives them a grin and a wave. Jody's heart soars.

                          JODY
           Come on.

          89 EXT. DAY. 10 MINUTES LATER. WINNARDS FARM. 89

           Jody is outside the back door. She lifts a flowerpot and
           takes the key from underneath.

                          JODY
           She keeps this here for Andy.

                          CASEY 
           What if she's got an alarm? 

                          JODY 
           Soon find out. 
          Jody opens the door. They go in. The alarm is hanging off the 
          wall, the wires pulled out. Jody grins at Casey, satisfied.

           What if they come back?

                          JODY
           If you're too chicken, go home.
           The girls wander in, awed. Jody turns and grins, her eyes
           like a cat's.

                         

          90 INT. NIGHT. HADDITON - A BOOK SHOP. 90

           Nicholas is doing a book signing. There's a good crowd.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that Claire with an `i'?
           Beth has a tray of mince pies. Glen is at her side.

                          BETH
           What about you, Glen? Where will you
           be?

                          GLEN
           In London with a collection of spare
           academics. I guess we'll be decking
           the halls in our own erudite way.

                          BETH
           I'll miss our chats. 

                          GLEN
           I've been in a state of writerly
           bliss these last weeks. I hope I
           get to come back.

                          BETH
           Me too. We'd love to have you.
           Glen doesn't want Beth to move away.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           You know, this is the best mince pie
           I've ever had.

                          BETH
           Oh?

                          GLEN
           If it was possible to have an orgasm
           from mere food, this mince pie would
           do it.

                          BETH

                          (EMBARRASSED)
           Golly.
           She moves away. Glen heads for the wine, kicking himself.

          Tamara and Ben walk in. Ben looks at the country casuals in
          undisguised horror.

                          BEN
           What the fuck are we doing here?

                          TAMARA
           It's kind of research; I want to
           write about them. They're funny, Ben -
           come on.
          They move through the crowd.

                          VINTNER
           The 2001 was the best. Someone just
           bought my last three cases...

           So I've got her this gorgeous
           Rajastani gagara skirt...
          Arriving at the mulled wine.

                          TAMARA
           Besides, I want to show you off.

                          BEN
           What am I - arm candy?

                          TAMARA
           More like arm fungus with that face
           on. Ben, meet Glen. Glen, meet Ben,
           my fiance.

                          GLEN
           You're getting married?

                          TAMARA
           Uh huh.

                          GLEN
           OK. Beautiful dress, magazine
           photoshoot - everything the
           aspiring novelist needs.

                          TAMARA
           I knew you'd be pleased.

                          GLEN
           Have a mince pie.

                          BEN
           Can we get out of here?

                          TAMARA
           Wait.

          She abandons him. Glen has turned away. Ben stands amid the
          nice chat, like a man being tortured.
          Meanwhile, Tamara is jumping the queue at Nicholas' desk.

                          ARMY GEEK
           In Field of Tares, you made Fred a
           corporal. But there's no such thing
           in the Royal Artillery. They call
           them bombardiers.

                          NICHOLAS
           Oh, thank you for that...

                          TAMARA
           Sorry.
          She flashes a smile at the Army Geek and puts her copy down
          in front of Nicholas.

                          TAMARA
           Could you do it for Ben? He's my
           fiance. We're getting married in
           the summer.

                          NICHOLAS
           So I hear. You have my heartiest
           commiserations, Tara.
           He hands her the book dismissively. Tamara is smarting.

                          TAMARA
           Well merry Christmas. Nicholarse.
           She turns away.

                         

          91 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 91

           Jody sniffs Ben's aftershave, longingly. Casey plucks his 
           guitar. They listen to the note in hushed awe. 
           Jody puts her foot into one of Tamara's killer stilettos. She 
           picks up Ben's drumsticks and kisses them, reverently. 

                          JODY
           We gotta live the dream, Casey.
           Live the dream...
           Jody and Casey jump up and down on the unmade bed. Jody pulls 
           a black T-shirt from under a pillow. She holds it to her
           face.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Ben...
           Casey is looking out of the window. The yellow Porsche is
           heading up the lane.

                          CASEY
           Omigod!
           A wild panic. They put things back where they found them.

                          JODY
           Go! Go! Go!
           She nicks the T-shirt.

           The girls sprint down the stairs and out.

          91B EXT. NIGHT. WINNARD'S FARM. 91B

           They dive behind a bush as the car pulls in. They lie on the
           ground splitting their sides with hushed laughter, as Ben and
           Tamara disappear into the house.

                         

          92 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 92

           Tamara and Ben are having a heated discussion.

                          BEN
           Why don't you sell it like you keep
           saying?

                          TAMARA
           Because... I've started writing.

                          BEN
           You can write anywhere.

                          TAMARA
           But this is proper. Not just stuff
           for the paper. 'It's about my teens -
           and is working for me here.

                          BEN
           Well it might be memory lane for you
           but it's doing my fucking head in. I
           want London. I want some Urban, OK?
           Are you with me or what? Cos I've had
           it with this place.
           Tamara is hurt - and deeply disappointed.

                          TAMARA
           Of course I'm with you...

                          BEN
           It's drab. It's depressing. And every 
           time I look out of the window I see
           Andy's arse - what's that about?

                         

          93 EXT. NEXT DAY. STONEFIELD - ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHACK. 93

           Andy is bending down, the top of his arse peeking out in the
           morning sun. Ben stares at it with distaste. Andy is plucking 
           a goose, putting all his frustration into it.

                          BEN
           We're leaving. Thank God. 
           Andy looks at him.

                          BEN
           Can I have one?

           Right now?

                          BEN

          Andy smirks, pointing at a big white duck.

                          ANDY
           That one's spare.

                          BEN
           Is that a goose?

                          ANDY
           You can take it now if you like.

                          BEN

                          (DISGUSTED)
           Oh come off it.

                          ANDY
           What?

                          BEN
           It's fucking alive.

                          ANDY
           Oh, you want it from Tesco, all
           plucked and headless sitting on a
           bandage.
          Ben's curiosity gets the better of him.

                          BEN
           How d'you do it then?
          Andy points towards an upturned traffic cone, held in place
          by a metal frame.

                          ANDY
           Gently put it's head down there; then
           quick in the skull with an air rifle. 
           Pluck it while it's warm, little pot

           No, but in my low wage economy, this
           flock's worth a lot.

                          BEN
           You're a sick fuck, Andy.
          Andy has had enough.

                          (SQUARING UP)
           What did you say?
           Andy stands. He's at least two inches taller than Ben.

                          ANDY
           I said grow up, little drummer boy.
           Ben thinks about it. He walks away. Glen appears with his
           suitcase on wheels containing most of his worldly goods.

                          ANDY
           Tamara rang me this morning. Said 
           to finish the house. It goes on the 
           market in the spring and that's it;
           over.

                          GLEN
           Why does the asshole always get the
           girl?
           He stands with Andy; comrades. Andy slaps him on the back.

                          ANDY
           Come on. Or you'll miss that train.

           Snow falling outside. Jody and Casey are in school uniform.
           Jody curled up on the bed; Casey at Tamara's PC. The room has 
           been redecorated. 

                          JODY
           It won't be just a shag, Case. It'll
           be an event. I'll be wearing like a
           gossamer slip with a bra bit; Prada.
           Or like a filmy, linen shirt, and...
           We see Jody's thought bubble. Ben is leaning against the door 
           frame, giving her a smouldering look. 

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           He'll be wearing a black T-shirt all
           taut over his buff bod and underneath
           Calvin Klein Boxers, black.
           Jody moves towards Ben. He buries his face in her neck as if
           he's found the love of his life.

          And he'll have like one tattoo of my
          name and lush pecs and we'll have
          candles and white sheets and I'll
          smell of Allure by Chanel.

           Ben lifts Jody on to the bed. They marvel at each other. He
           bends down to kiss her.

           JODY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           And he tries to stop himself but I'm
           a vision and he gets drawn into my
           power and it'll be like Uhhh... But
           also respectful. And my `V' plates
           will melt into nothing.
           She looks up. Casey is reading at the PC.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Are you listening?

                          CASEY
           I like this.

           What?

                          CASEY
           There's this bit right, where her dad
           takes her for dinner and she thinks
           it's some big treat but what he's
           doing, right, is telling her he's
           leaving them. And she, right, she's
           gutted and she yaks all her food into
           a napkin and puts it on his plate.

                          JODY
           So?

                          CASEY
           It's painful. But funny. It's about
           her; Plastic Fantastic. She's sad,
           Jode.

                          JODY
           Sad? She's a lucky cunt.

           Tamara is trying to write. Ben is playing his drum kit, high
           as a kite. The noise is deafening. Tamara sits back, looking
           around the boyish pad. It feels alien. The phone rings.

                         

          96 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM 96

           Andy is on the phone, examining the decrepit shed. Nothing

           FARM.
           Tamara takes the phone out onto the balcony to escape the
           noise. She slowly smiles, knowing what he's thinking. 

                          TAMARA
           I don't know; the shed... What do
           you think?

                          ANDY
           I recommend preserving it.

                          TAMARA
           Really?

                          ANDY
           Always useful, a good shed.

                          TAMARA
           Well then. Keep it...
           Andy puts the phone down, grinning. Tamara is grinning too,
           sharing the same memory.

           Beth is decorating a little pink valentine cake. She's on the

           Beth looks at the cake. It says To My Valentine in piped 
           lettering around the edge. She picks up her icing bag, full 
           of unease. 
           In the middle of the cake she ices a big question mark. Then 
           she quickly looks up a number and dials.

           Oh - actually - don't worry - I've 
           just found it. 
           Beth puts the phone down, biting her lip. She is relieved, 
           ashamed and ultimately not reassured. She looks to camera. 

                          BETH 
           Nicholas has been telling the truth 
           a lot recently.

           Jody, dressed in Tamara's leopard skin coat, is admiring
           herself in Tamara's mirror, swigging from a bottle of wine.
           We hear Casey reading the card.

           You are so fit
           I wanna shag you.
           Love from Ben pfwoor!!!
           Jody takes another swig with a wicked grin, she sits at
           Tamara's PC.
           We hear Casey knock three times on the back door.

           Chloe bag and bright red lipstick.

                          CASEY
           I sent you that.
           Jody takes another swig from the bottle of wine.

           Is that theirs?

                          JODY
           It's my mum's; they don't drink this

           The drumming leads up to a massive crescendo and stops.

           Can you go to the farm? Just take a

           He wouldn't do that.

           Making himself all cosy in your

           prob'ly wearing your fucking pants -

                          TAMARA
           No way!

                          BEN
           Bet it was him that nicked my black
           T-shirt.

                          TAMARA
           There is no way Andy would do that!
          Ben pulls his jacket on.

                          BEN
           Well that says it all; the way you
           leap to his defence.

                          TAMARA
           He hasn't done anything.

                          BEN
           You know what? I know Fran fucked
           my best friend but at least she was
           straight with me.

                          TAMARA
           Ben - where are you going? Don't
           go!

           He pushes her away, harder than he meant to. She lands on the
           sofa, shocked.

                          BEN (CONT'D)

                          (WITHOUT APOLOGY)
           I'm taking the dog for a crap.
           He grabs the lead and opens the door. It slams shut. Tamara's
           dread overwhelms her.

                         

          106 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 106

           Poppy is reading a print-out of Tamara's email. Beth is
           folding sheets.

                          POPPY
           Oh come on mum. She's just stirring
           shit. Tamara's always done that.

                          BETH
           Why's your father on there - and
           poor Andy? It's so tasteless.

                          POPPY
           (helping with the sheets)
           You know how subversive she is. She
           once sent me a valentine from
           Prince Harry - and I believed it.
           It's her sense of humour; she likes
           causing trouble. At school she used
           to give us first years tips on how
           to shoplift.

                          BETH
           She taught you to shoplift?

                          POPPY
           Mum, she's marrying Ben Sergeant.
           Why would she look at an old git
           like dad?
           Nicholas is in the shadowy hall, listening with interest.
           Poppy helps Beth upstairs with the laundry. Nicholas steps
           into the kitchen. Poppy has left the email on the table.
           Nicholas picks it up, deeply curious.

           Nicholas is walking up the field wearing his red scarf. Andy 
           is outside his shed, doing heavy work.

           Casey and Jody are pouring over a gossip mag; pictures of
           celebrity blonde with new man.

           she gets called a dirty slag.

           Tamara arrives outside her house. Depressed. She remains in 
           the car, reluctant to go in, to face her isolation. 
           She looks at herself in the mirror. The face that stares back 
           seems like that of a stranger.

           Tamara is lying in bed with her brand new nose bandaged up. 
           He face is covered in bruising. She is panicking - 
           experiencing a loss of self. 

                         

          109B EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109B 

           The mask drops. All her old insecurities come back. She gets 
           out of the car and slams the door, unable to stand the sight 
           of herself. She lets herself in. 

                         

          109C INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 109C 

           The inside of the house has been transformed by Andy. The 
           drab gloomy shades of her mother have gone, replaced by warm 
           tones which bring out the beauty of the house. 
           Tamara wanders through. She turns around taking it all in. 
           She never knew the house was so beautiful.

           Nicholas sees Tamara. He waits while she emerges from the
           copse.

                          TAMARA
           I'm looking for Andy.

           Tamara is about to turn back.

           Tamara's car pulls up. Jody and Casey wheel around closer on
           their bikes. Tamara tries the door. The pub is shut. She
           looks in through the glass and sees Zoe up on the bar,
           clinging to Andy in a long embrace. Tamara is frozen. Andy
           kisses Zoe, long and tender.
           Tamara turns.
           She gets back in her car, trying to hide her distress - which
           has taken her completely by surprise. Jody and Casey stare
           mutely as she drives away.

           Tamara is playing with the ill-fitting ring that Ben gave
           her. She puts it a jar and closes the lid. There's a knock on 
           the front door. She startles, her face falling. She answers 
           it. Nicholas is on the threshold.

           Hello.

                          TAMARA
           So. Nicholas.
           She lets the door fall open. She backs into the hall.
           Nicholas walks in. He closes the door. They look at each
           other. Neither of them moves.

                          NICHOLAS
           You can tell me to leave.
           Tamara says nothing. 

                          NICHOLAS
           You can throw me right out.
           Nicholas slowly takes his red scarf and coat off. He hangs
           them on a coat hook, bringing himself closer to her.

                          NICHOLAS
           Just say and I'll go.
           She still can't speak. Nicholas takes her in his arms. He is 
           big and fatherly and comforting.
           Tamara feels a sense of relief, of not being alone. Her arms 
           go around him. When he kisses her, he's surprisingly real,
           vulnerable even, as if he's left his lordly persona at the
           door. Tamara closes her eyes.
           Their kisses become more urgent.

                         

          117 INT. DUSK. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 117

           Tamara is lying in Nicholas' arms in the growing darkness. He
           looks blissfully post-coital. Tamara is gazing ahead. A tear
           rolls down her cheek. It lands on Nicholas' chest.

                          NICHOLAS
           Are you crying?

                          TAMARA
           No.
           Nicholas is taken aback. He instinctively holds her.

                          NICHOLAS
           Don't cry. Am I really that bad?
           Tamara shakes her head, glad of him.

                          TAMARA
           I'm just not myself.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes you are.
           She looks up at him.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           You're relentlessly, rudely,
           uncompromisingly yourself.
           A smile appears on Tamara's face. 

                          TAMARA
           I used to watch you out of my window
           helping your daughter learn to
           skateboard up the lane. Bit of an
           obvious crush, wasn't it.

                          NICHOLAS
           Is that why you're crying?

                          TAMARA
           No.

           Am I here as revenge on your ex?

                          TAMARA
           I don't know why you're here. Why are
           you here, Nicholas?

                          NICHOLAS
           Because... since you climbed over
           that stile in the summer I haven't 
           thought about very much else.
           She doesn't believe him.

                          TAMARA
           You can use me in one of your books. 

                         

          118 INT. NIGHT. WINNARDS FARM - THE HALL. 118

           Nicholas is putting his coat on. Tamara is uneasy.

                          NICHOLAS
           When can we do this again?

                          TAMARA

                          TAMARA
           Isn't life complicated enough?
           Nicholas shakes his head. He kisses her.

                         

          119 INT. NIGHT. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 119

           Nicholas strolls in. He's ecstatically happy. Beth is getting
           something out of the Aga.

                          BETH
           Oh poor you - was it awful?

                          NICHOLAS
           Bloody terrible. Didn't move till
           well past Chiswick. But look, I
           nipped into Fortnums...
           He hands her a package.

                          BETH
           All my favourite teas - Oh!
           He embraces her. He is affectionate, magnanimous in his
           bliss. Beth is taken aback by his warmth.

                          BETH
           My goodness. You feel like my buzzy
           toothbrush just after I've charged it
           up. You should go up to London more
           often.

                          NICHOLAS
           Maybe I will...
           Nicholas goes to the table. The writers greet him as he sits.

                          NICHOLAS
           Sorry everybody; traffic was a pig.
           Do carry on...

                          LUCETTA
           I'm trying this magic realist bit

           the characters slowly turn into

                          NICHOLAS
           That sounds very innovative...

                          LUCETTA
           Do you think so? It's sort of the
           key to the structure, which I'm
           thinking of as a nest shape...

           Nicholas listens benevolently as Lucetta shares. His good
           humour is so out of his recent character that Beth watches
           him with increasing unease. There is something in her eyes
           akin to suspicion.

           Beth is putting Glen's luggage into the boot.

                          GLEN
           So after two years of radio silence
           I contact my editor. And she loves -
           I mean loves the chapters I did in
           the fall.

                          BETH
           Oh Glen.

                          GLEN 
           I tried writing at the library but 
           I could feel that awful paralysis 
           descending again.

           GLEN (V.O.) 
           I missed everything that I've been, 
           you know, finding here. 
           (Seeing the view) 
           Oh my god - it's so beautiful! 
           They are now in the village driving down the main drag. 

                          BETH 
           I'm glad you've come back.

                          GLEN
           A few solid weeks should - holy cow!
           An egg hits the windscreen (shot the same way as the earlier
           scene). Casey and Jody hide. Beth gets out of the car to
           clean the window.

                          GLEN
           Idiots! Morons! Hey, writers! Let's

           There's this theory he gave his
           wife syphilis, right? No evidence
           but the symptoms fit. The poor
           woman gets kind of eccentric and
           moves her bed up to their attic -

           Yes, actually.

           He gave his wife syphilis.

          He goes. Beth is ashamed of his condescension.

           Nicholas is reading, hunched over a computer. He glances 
           round. Tamara, wearing a robe, is awaiting his opinion. 

                          TAMARA 
           Is it any good? Because I keep - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Shush. 
           (Points at the screen) 
           This is brutally candid. You lay 
           yourself completely bare. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'm well-known for it. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Seriously. It's very moving. 
           Tamara knows this is praise indeed. She is deeply gratified. 

                          TAMARA
           Thank you.

                          NICHOLAS
           So... have I done my duty?

                          TAMARA
           Admirably.

                          NICHOLAS
           Now do I get my treat?
           Tamara, almost in his arms, is crestfallen.

                          TAMARA
           You are so cheesy.
           Tamara is staring at him with something akin to distaste.

           We see Jody's thought bubble of Tamara luridly dead, her

           D'you think she might be lying there
           all choked in vomit and drug froth?

                          CASEY
           That'd be dire.

           If we find her we'll get in the

           Andy is outside the farm beside his landrover. He walks up to 
           the front door. Hesitates. 
           Behind the railings, the girls arrive.

           Tamara opens the door in some deshabille. To her surprise, 
           she sees Andy on the threshold, looking spruced up and 
           handsome. The contrast with Nicholas couldn't be more 
           apparent. She finds herself genuinely pleased to see him. 

                          TAMARA

           Shake off the winter blues. Come

           I can't... I'm kind of on one with 
           my writing.
           Over her shoulder, Andy sees Nicholas' red scarf and coat
           hanging on the coat hook. He hides his shock. Tamara is 
           unaware that he has seen. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Can we do it soon though? I'd 
           really like to; just not right now. 
           He nods at her in disbelief.

                          (COOLLY) 
           Sure. 
           He turns on his heels and goes. Tamara closes the door. 
           Outside, Andy is leaning over his land-rover, sickened. 

                          JODY 
           D'you think he's in with a chance?

           Why not? He's fit. I'd do him.

           the shed... 

                         

          129 EXT. DAY. WINNARD'S FARM. 129 

           Andy's Land Rover roars away. 

                          JODY
           Let's go. I'm freezing my tits off.

                          CASEY
           Wait!!
           Casey is looking back at Tamara's door. Tamara is peering
           out. Nicholas joins her, putting his coat on. He kisses her
           passionately. He wants to stay. She's insisting he leaves.

                          JODY
           Oh. My. God.

                          CASEY
           It's him. From Stonefield.

                          JODY
           The dirty cheating sod.

                         

          130 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN. 130

           Tamara wanders in looking like she's trying to shake Nicholas
           out of her hair. She sits, full of apprehension.
           We see her fears: Beth, in her apron, pulling Tamara's hair
           back and coming at her face with an electric hand-held whisk.

                          BETH
           You fucking little slut.
           She puts her head in her hands.

                         

          131 INT. EVENING. JODY'S BEDROOM. 131

           Jody and Casey have Googled Nicholas. They are outraged.

           that after Ben?

                          CASEY
           Maybe she's numbing the pain.

                          JODY
           He's not even a proper celeb.

                          CASEY
           Maybe older guys know more... you
           know, bed stuff.

                          JODY
           Eww! He's a perv. I hate him.

           Beth is walking to the post box. Jody and Casey are at the
           bus shelter, gazing at her with keenest pity.

                          BETH
           Hello Casey. How are you?
           Jody nudges her. Casey nods. Beth posts her mail.

           Bus got scrapped.

                          BETH
           So it did. Well. Hope it doesn't
           rain.
           She turns for home.

                          CASEY
           Gutted for her.

                          JODY

          135 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE (HALSTOCK). 135

           Casey and Jody stroll down a lonely lane. Misty. Rooks caw. 

                          CASEY 
           There'll be the divorce and like 
           acrimony and her world'll fall

                          JODY 
           Yeah. 

                          CASEY 
           But maybe one day, she'll put the 
           bitterness behind her and find a

           Don't be daft. She's old, you big 
           sop. 
           A parked 4x4 looms out of the mist. 

                          CASEY
           See? That's D-List's car. 

                          JODY 
           So this is where he hides it when he 
           goes to shag Plastic.

           He's a rotten cheater.

           Like my dad. Come on Case. Let's 
           fuck him up.

                         

          135A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM. 135A 

           Nicholas looks to see if the coast is clear - then lets 
           himself out.

          136 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 136

           Nicholas is striding purposefully back to his car with a smug 
           post-coital grin. Then he sees that one of his tyres has been 
           let down. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Shit salad.
           He gets out his phone. Jody and Casey are in the trees
           watching, satisfied.

                         

          136A INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 136A

           Beth is on the phone preparing to cook.

                          BETH
           Oh poor you. What a drag.

                         

          137 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 137

           Tamara is half-running down the track with a foot pump.

                         

                         138 CUT 138

           The rooks are cawing.

                          NICHOLAS
           Yes, it's a frightful bore.

           BETH (O.S.)
           Well I'll hold off on the paella.
           Tamara arrives, breathless. Nicholas signals her to keep
           quiet. She looks guilty, anxious.

                          NICHOLAS
           You're a marvel. See you soon.

                         

          140 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE KITCHEN. 140

           The line goes dead. Beth is disconcerted. Glen walks in.

                          GLEN
           Beth, could I use your printer?

                          BETH
           Nicholas is on the motorway with a
           flat tyre. But I couldn't hear
           traffic. Just rooks...

           She snaps out of it. But she knows.

                          BETH
           Did you ask me to read something?

                         

          141 EXT. DAY. A SECLUDED LANE. 141

           The tyres are done. Nicholas is about to get in the car.

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas, someone knows. Maybe we 

                          SHOULD -

                          NICHOLAS
           Who cares?
           He kisses her, passionately. She is troubled but eventually
           responds. Jody nudges Casey.

                          JODY
           Casey, pap them. Pap them!
           Casey holds out her mobile and takes a picture. Then Tamara
           extricates herself from his embrace. 
           Jody peers at Casey's photo. A close-up clinch.

                          JODY (CONT'D)
           Fucking bingo.

          141A EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN / LANE. 141A

           Tamara, dressed for a walk, heads down the lane. She looks
           preoccupied.
           Jody appears from behind the hedge. She heads for the door,
           motioning Casey to follow.

                         

          142 INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 142

           Jody is at the computer. Casey is keeping a nervous watch.

                          CASEY
           This is wrong, Jode.

                          JODY
           She's asking for it; slut. I'm 
           going to email D-List's wife. 

                          CASEY
           We should send the photo and be done
           with it.

          Jody suddenly startles.

           What?

                          JODY
           While I was sitting here. Look. An
           e-mail from Ben come in. Just like
           that, when I'm here.

                          (SHE READS:)

           Ben is play-fighting with Boss.

           BEN (V.O.)
           And as it's a cute little brown girl
           with curly black hair I think we can
           safely say it's Steven Culley's and
           not mine. Truth is, I feel released.
           I am free! New band up and running.
           Done three songs about me and you.
           Ben throws a treat lovingly at Boss. Boss catches it.

           BEN (V.O.) (CONT'D)
           Big favour to ask. We're recording in
           Paris. Would you have Boss?

           `Could drop him off next week. And
           when I'm back, maybe we could dot dot

                          CASEY
           He's coming back.

           Nicholas is writing. Beth approaches.

           There's the festival brochure. You're

           You're a marvel. Cheers.
           He kisses her and prepares to leave. She is suspicious.

           Oh, don't. You hate festivals.

           But it's only Hadditon. I'll come. 

                          NICHOLAS
           It's completely boring. You'll hate

           Her suspicion will stay silent no longer.

                          BETH
           Have you got anything to tell me,

           Like what?
           Nicholas attacks; the best form of defence.

                          NICHOLAS
           God, it's like living with the
           effing moral police. Are you ever
           going to trust me?
           He goes.

           Nicholas drives through a huge puddle in his 4X4, splashing

                          BETH
           I'm doing this cake in celebration. 
           Well done.
          Glen holds up his mug of coffee.

                          GLEN
           To Hardy. 

                          BETH

                          (TOASTING HIM)
           Although I can't bear the man for
           what he did to his wife.
          Andy comes in with an armful of logs.

                          GLEN
           Well, things were different then.
           She had no choice. 
          Beth's mobile bleeps. She picks it up.

                          GLEN
           She couldn't just walk away. I mean
           who'd put up with that now?
          Beth drops the mixing bowl. She cannot speak.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           What is it?

                          BETH
           (Looking to Andy)
           How do I find out who sent this?
          Andy takes the phone, sees the photo.

                          ANDY
           It says number withheld.
          He returns the phone.

                          BETH 
           Did you know?
          Andy nods guiltily. Beth acknowledges what this means.

                          ANDY
           Couldn't tell you. I'm sorry Beth. 
          He leaves.

                          BETH
           Her...
          Glen looks at the photo; Nicholas and Tamara's clinch.

          Oh My God. This is just - this is
          horrible.

                          BETH
          Right under my nose. I feel sick.

                          GLEN
           It's so shitty, so insulting. You 
           do not deserve to be treated -

                          BETH
           If you're kind to me, I'll cry. I
           don't want to cry. I must be very
           clear.

                          GLEN
           If there is anything I can do...

                          BETH

                          (MOVING AWAY)
           I have to do it myself.
           Beth's face cracks into distress.

                          GLEN
           Hey, come on.

                          BETH
           I trod in the sponge mix.

                          GLEN
           It's OK. It's OK.

          150 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD. ANDY'S CORRUGATED SHED. 150

           Tamara is out on a walk. She approaches the shed; sees Andy's
           landrover parked beside it.

                          TAMARA (CALLING)
           Andy?
           Andy emerges. Tamara smiles tentatively. 

                          TAMARA
           Hey. How are you? 
           Andy says nothing.

                          TAMARA
           Would you like to have that drink? I 
           could do with a friend / at the 
           moment and - 

                          ANDY 
           You and Nicholas Hardiment. That's a
           nice piece of work isn't it?

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 92.

                         

                         
          Tamara is utterly dismayed.

                          ANDY
           I get it from his point of view. He's
           always been a cheating wanker. He
           loves having his cake and eating it - 
           But since when did your standards
           drop so low? You could have anyone.
           All you have to do is bat your eyes.

                          TAMARA

                          ANDY -

                          ANDY
           I care a lot about Beth. She helped
           me out when I was at rock bottom.

                          TAMARA
           I'm not going to split them up. It's

                          JUST -

                          ANDY

                          (WITH CONTEMPT)
           A bit of fun?
          Tamara is covered with shame. 

                          TAMARA 
           It's none of your bloody business. 

                          ANDY 
           I reckoned I could still see the 
           blazing girl you used to be. But now? 

                          TAMARA 
           Shut up! 

                          ANDY 
           I don't know who you are. 
          She turns away, her eyes stinging.

           Jody falls off her bed.

                          JODY
           That's right, yes... I love dogs.

           The crap is done. Man and dog are back in the car.

           So I'll meet you at Winnards Farm,

           Jody is haranguing with her mum.

                          JODY
           It's a nice dog, Mum!

                          MUM
           Well I don't like `em. Dog-hair and
           slobber all over the place.

                          JODY
           But I said yes.

                          MUM
           No dogs, no way and that's final.
           Jody is devastated.

                          JODY
           You loser. I hate you. You want to

           RUIN MY LIFE!!!
           Jody slams her bedroom door. She stares at herself in the
           mirror. She steels herself.

           Tamara pulls Nicholas into a quiet corner.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Andy Cobb has rumbled us.

                          NICHOLAS
           Cock pie. Has he told Beth?

                          TAMARA
           I don't know. But he might. And I
           wouldn't blame him.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 94.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS
           Well, I suppose it has to come out 
           sometime.

                          TAMARA
           Does it? 

                          NICHOLAS
           It's a good thing. Feels like a 
           relief. Means you and I can start to 
           think about our plans. For the
           future...

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas?... 

                          NICHOLAS
           I know it's been hard, sharing me 
           with Beth. But I'm yours now. I'm 
           going to leave her. I want a new 
           life - and I want it now. With you. 
           Tamara is appalled. A minder interrupts. 

                          MINDER
           Mr Hardiment? It's time.

           During the interview, Tamara takes a seat at the end of the
           front row. The audience listens attentively.

                          NICHOLAS
           It all runs very smoothly. I start a
           book in the summer, publish it the
           following spring. Bit of a factory, 
           really. 

                          INTERVIEWER
           So you've just finished `Like The
           Night', Inchcombe's seventeenth
           adventure. Are you already planning
           the next?

                          NICHOLAS
           There won't be a next one. Frankly 
           I'm sick to death of Inchcombe. In 
           fact, I'm about to kill him off.
           There's a gust of dismay in the crowd, as though a real death
           has been announced.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 95.

                         

                         

                          INTERVIEWER
           That's a bombshell for your fans.

                          NICHOLAS
           (all for Tamara)
           Yes, but I'm moving on to fresh
           pastures.

           LADY IN THE CROWD
           No!

                          NICHOLAS
           Inchcombe will be meeting a very
           sticky end. And it's one murder I'm
           really looking forward to.

           LADY IN THE CROWD
           How could you?

                          INTERVIEWER
           This might be a good moment to take a
           few questions. Yes, the lady in the
           apron...

                          BETH
           You write a lot about adultery. Is
           that from personal experience?
           Tamara turns round. Nicholas' colour drains. Beth is with
           Glen, close by - glaring at him. He tries to make a joke.

                          NICHOLAS
           Madam, what a saucy question!

                          BETH
           Why do you cheat persistently on your
           wife?
           Nicholas considers whether he wants to be publicly
           humiliated. He decides not.

                          NICHOLAS
           Because she lets me.
           Beth takes this like a blow. Even Tamara is shocked by it.

                         

          156 EXT. DAY. HADDITON - THE GROUNDS BY THE MARQUEE. 156

           Tamara is striding away from the Marquee, red with shame.
           Nicholas is at her side almost jogging to keep up. 

                          TAMARA
           It's got to stop, Nicholas.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 96.

                         

                         

                          NICHOLAS
           You're right. I can't go on using 
           her, lying to her. Won't be fun but
           I've got to do it.

                          TAMARA

                          LISTEN -

                          NICHOLAS
           I don't feel alive with Beth! I
           haven't been living for years. She's 
           had me smothered in a comfy blanket - 

                          TAMARA
           Nicholas, listen to me.
          She makes him look at her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           We had fun. But it's wrong. And
           it's over. 

                          NICHOLAS
           But... I'm in love with you.

                          TAMARA
           I'm sorry. 
          Nicholas looks as if he's just been punched.

                          NICHOLAS
           No. You can't end it. Tamara - Fuck
           supper!

                          TAMARA
           Will you keep it down? 

                          NICHOLAS
           My God, you're cold hearted.

                          TAMARA 
           Please don't shout. 

                          NICHOLAS 
           You don't feel a thing, do you? 

                          TAMARA
           I do feel. I feel like I'm blazing
           away inside all the time. Why do I do
           these things? What am I doing with
           you?
          The question hangs between them.

                          NICHOLAS
           There's someone else isn't there...

                          TAMARA
           Oh for God's sake. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Not that narcissist drummer? 

                          TAMARA
           Goodbye.

                          NICHOLAS
           It's that ignorant lunk isn't it?
           That muscle-bound wastrel Andy Cobb.

                          TAMARA
           Andy Cobb is a far better man than
           you!
           In saying it, Tamara realises it's true. She walks away.
           Nicholas bends almost double in pain, letting out a great
           moan from the soul. A fan has been waiting at a respectful
           distance. He approaches.
           Nicholas numbly takes his book. Instead of signing, he tears
           it to pieces. He hands the tatters back to the fan.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Thank you.

           She heads up the stairs.

                         

          157A INT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - TAMARA'S BEDROOM. 157A


           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 98.

                         

                         
          Jody enters Tamara's bedroom. She stares at the bed. She runs
          her hand over the cotton percale. She puts on Tamara's slip
          and looks at herself in the mirror.

                          BEN
           Hello Jody...
          Jody spins round.
          The door closes. Ben is standing behind it. He is wearing a
          tight black T-shirt; the man of her dreams.

                          BEN
           Dog minder? I guessed you might be
           the somebody who's been getting in
           here, pissing about, sending e-mails
           and fucking people up. D'you know 
           what I'm saying? You've been breaking
           in.

                          JODY
           I didn't break in. Used the key.

                          BEN
           What key?

                          JODY
           Found it under a pot.

                          BEN
           Well for fuck's sake. Did you nick
           my T-shirt?

                          JODY
           Took it as a souvenir. I'm sorry!
          Jody is very scared. She is crying.

                          BEN
           Creeping about in our stuff? What
           gives you the right?

                          JODY
           I just... like I always wanted to
           meet you...just once...just to tell
           you stuff...

                          BEN
           What stuff?

                          JODY
           Like... I love you.

                          BEN
           So that's nice. Least someone does.

                          



                         

                         

                          JODY
           I used to lie awake thinking about
           you being here... in Ewedown, the
           bumhole of nowhere. It was the
           best thing to happen ever. I've
           been so in love with you. And when
           you left I couldn't bear it. I
           thought the valentine would make
           you come back...

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           D'you still love me, Jody? Even
           though I wanna lock you up in a
           young offenders institution?
           Jody nods, unsure.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           What would you do for me then?
           Would you do anything, like a
           proper fan?
           Jody looks at him, scared. She manages a nod. Ben approaches
           her.

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Let's see then shall we?
           We see Jody's phone flashing on the bed. 

           CASEY (V.O.) 
           Jody! What are you doing not
           fucking answering?

                         

          158 EXT. DAY. EWEDOWN. 158

           Casey is at the triangle leaving a message on Jody's phone. 
           Boss is running round and round it.

                          CASEY
           Ben's dog. It's here. Means Ben
           must be - 
           Casey suddenly realises where Jody is. The dog runs off up 
           the street. Casey sets off towards Winnards, full of 
           apprehension.

                         

          159 INT. DAY. STONEFIELD - DOWNSTAIRS. 159

           Beth is taking Nicholas' awards down and chucking them in a
           box. Glen is trying to save them from smashing.

                          BETH
           I bet that bitch wants a baby. Well
           she'll find out; Nicholas doesn't
           do children.

          She is brandishing a diamond dagger award.

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           He'll leave it all up to her.
           That'll age her.

                          GLEN

                          BETH -

                          BETH
           But suppose he discovers
           fatherhood?

                          BETH (CONT'D)
           They do, these men, second time
           round. They get all nappy-happy.
           I was barely twenty when I got
           pregnant. I've never done
           anything! Oh God! God!

                          GLEN
           Yes you have. Look at this place!

                          BETH
           I hate him - I've wasted my life! 

                          GLEN
           No... What about all the work you do
           here?

                          BETH
           Breeding goats? Baking fucking
           biscuits? It's meaningless!
          Beth bawls. Glen holds her.

                          GLEN 
           Beth... When I was lost with my
           book you helped me more than you
           know. You asked who I was writing
           it for...
          He starts to really hold her. The sobbing subsides.

                          GLEN
           You.
          He kisses her. Beth looks at Glen; a revelation. The future
          opens up. She kisses him back.

                          NICHOLAS
           Excuse me.
          Nicholas is standing in the doorway, looking grey.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           May I speak with my wife?
          Glen releases Beth.

                          BETH
           No. You may not.
          She walks away.

          160 EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE GROUNDS. 160

           Beth walks outside towards the chicken coup. Nicholas pursues
           her. She sees Boss running across the grounds chasing birds.

                          NICHOLAS
           It's over.

                          BETH
           That's Ben Sergeant's dog. Perhaps 
           he's come to beat the shit out of 
           you - good! 

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth - I finished it. She's been 
           chasing me; this wild crush - 

                          BETH 

                          LIAR - 

                          NICHOLAS 
           There's something desperate about 
           her, something almost unhinged - 

                          BETH
           Good God, even when you try and 
           tell the truth you lie. YOU LIE!!
           Nicholas is falling apart.

                          BETH
           I want you to leave. I want a
           divorce. I want Stonefield.

                          NICHOLAS
           Beth...Don't. You can't.

                          BETH
           I will.

                          (TO BOSS)
           And you - Go home! Bugger Off!!
           She throws a handful of chicken feed at him. Boss runs away.
           Beth storms off.
           Nicholas looks profoundly shocked; like a man who has just
           realised he's in danger of drowning.

           Tamara's car pulls up outside. She gets out, looking at the

           Jody is shakily pouring a pot of tea.

                          BEN
           Right. Now put two sugars in and
           stir it. OK. That's a decent cup.
           Which is lucky Jody cos if it had
           been shit, I'd be on the phone to
           the extremely scary local cops
           right now.

                          JODY
           I'm gonna get out as soon as I can.
           Going to work in Vegas - as a
           croupier. Vegas, or a cruise liner.

                          BEN

           Boss is lolloping round. He stops. The whole herd of cows is
           staring at him. Boss regards the animals with curiosity. He
           wags his tail. Will they play? He starts to bark.

                         

          163 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS. 163

           Nicholas sees Glen sitting on the edge of an old rusting
           trough. Fury overwhelms him. 

                          NICHOLAS
           Oy! Greg! I want a a word with you.

                          GLEN
           It's Glen, asshole.
           Nicholas is stomping through the mud and cowshit. 

                          NICHOLAS
           You fucking devious bastard.

                          GLEN 
           I'm devious? I'm a bastard?

                          GLEN 
           It's Beth's. She made this place - 

                          NICHOLAS
           And I fucking pay for it. I've 
           given Beth all this. What can you 
           give her? 

                          GLE 
           I can give her / integrity! 

                          NICHOLAS 
           Obscure literary shit not worth ten 

                          PENCE - 

                          GLEN
           You know if I made my pile
           fantasizing rapes and homicides I
           wouldn't be so proud.

                          NICHOLAS

                          (SHOVING HIM)
           You cunt.

                          GLEN
           Fuck you.
          Glen grabs him round the middle. They struggle like overgrown
          schoolboys.

                          NICHOLAS (CONT'D)
           Beth'll come to her senses. You
           need an income to run Stonefield.
           And mine's bigger than yours!
          Glen nuts him. Nicholas slips backwards in the mud. He whacks
          his skull on the sharp, rusting corner of the trough. He
          falls to the ground. Glen is astonished at his own prowess.

                          GLEN
           Now... get up, Nicholas. Let's talk
           about this like grown men.
          Blood trickles from the wound on Nicholas' head. He moans.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           Oh my God. Nicholas...
          Glen becomes aware of a sound like a drumbeat, the drumming
          of hooves. The herd of cows come over the brow of the hill
          and down towards them. Boss is chasing them, barking. The
          beasts are terrified, stampeding.

           GOLDENROD REVISIONS 20.10.09 104.

                         

                         
           They are heading straight for the trough. Nicholas is trying
           to get up on his knees.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           Nicholas! Get up! Run!
           Glen puts out a hand to help him. But before Nicholas
           notices, he instinctively retrieves it.
           Glen turns on his heels and runs, terrified. He throws
           himself into the hedge as the cows thunder past. They
           disappear down the hill, Boss still behind them.
           Glen looks back towards the water trough. Nicholas is lying
           on his front, his face pressed into the mud, unmoving.
           Glen walks over. He gingerly peers at him. The back of
           Nicholas' skull is broken open. Blood is pooling in the mud
           and shit. Glen panics. He looks all around. Has the accident
           been seen?
           No human is visible. Has his part in it been noticed? He
           bends down as if to turn the body over, in case by some
           miracle Nicholas still lives. He cannot bring himself to
           touch him. Fear overwhelms him. He runs away.

                         

          164 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE KITCHEN / HALL. 164

           Tamara is looking at Jody, stunned.

                          TAMARA
           It was you?
           Jody can't look her in the eye.

                          BEN
           Jody has explained that she did it
           out of deep love for me.
           To Ben's astonishment, Tamara smiles. He grabs his moment. 

                          BEN (CONT'D)
           Tamara... 
           It's an apology. Tamara takes Ben's hand and leads him 
           through to a dresser in the hall. She opens it.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Ben. 
           She takes the ring out of the jar and puts it in his hand. 

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)

           At that moment, Casey appears at the back door.

          165 EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS. 165

           Boss is still worrying the herd. He's got them against a
           gate. The animals are very distressed. Behind them we see
           Andy's Landrover appear.

          165A EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM) 165A

           Andy gets out of his Landrover, takes out his rifle, comes
           through the gate. Loads his rifle while watching the dog.

           He raises the gun.

                         

          165D EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165D

           Through his sights, the dog.

                         

          165E EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165E

           As his finger tightens on the trigger.
           Bang. A shot rings out. He looks round, off right.

                         

          165F EXT. DAY. THE FIELDS (LARKHAM). 165F

           Up on the ridge of the hill, Penny Upminster is standing in a
           straw hat and flowery wellies, with a smoking gun.

                          PENNY
           Got `im. The beast.

           Beth is coming down the field where Nicholas lies. She sees a
           figure in the distance. She squints, the sun in her eyes.

                         

          168D EXT. DAY. COPSE (LARKHAM'S) 168D

           Opposite her she sees Tamara descending through the copse.

                         

          169 EXT. DAY. FIELD. (LARKHAMS) 169

           Tamara, walking down by the trough, discovers Nicholas' body.
           She drops to her knees, light-headed with shock.

                         

          170 EXT. DAY. FIELD. 170

           Beth walks into the field. She sees Tamara kneeling, looking
           at something on the other side of the trough.

                          BETH
           Bitch.
           Tamara looks up.

                          TAMARA
           Beth - no -

                          BETH
           Brazen. That is brazen.
           Beth carries on walking towards her.

                          TAMARA
           Beth. Don't.
           Tamara is running towards Beth. She cannot bear her to see.
           She throws her arms around her, protecting her.

                          TAMARA (CONT'D)
           Don't look. Don't look...
           It is too late. Beth is seeing the corpse. A great wave of
           shock hits her. Tamara holds her tight, trying to contain it.
           Another great wave of shock.

           Her cries of grief soar over the valley.

                         

          171 EXT. DAY. THE FIELD - LATER. 171

           Tamara, ashen, is on the phone to emergency services. 

                          TAMARA 
           You'll get to it through Byley farm. 
           His skull is broken. It's smashed. No 
           I haven't but... it's obvious. His 
           wife. Yes she is. Thank you. Thank 
           you. I will. 
           Beth has turned Nicholas over. She is washing the mud from 
           his face with water from the trough.

                          TAMARA 
           They're on their way... 
           Beth seems totally closed off. Tamara gingerly approaches. 
           She touches Beth's shoulder.

                          TAMARA
           Beth? Help is coming - 
           Beth cannot bear to be touched. Her hand involuntarily flies
           out. It slams into Tamara's face.
           Tamara steps back. Her nose is broken, pouring blood.

                          TAMARA 
           It's broken! - 
           She gasps, riding the pain, knowing she deserves it. It's the 
           biggest wake-up call of her life.
           Beth stares at her, at first astonished at what she has done -
           then satisfied. Tamara stumbles away.

                         

          171A EXT. DAY. IN THE COPSE. LATER. 171A 

           Tamara sits beside a dewpond, gingerly washing the blood off
           her face.

                          ANDY
           Tamara...
           Andy is watching. She turns away from him. He approaches. 

                          TAMARA 
           I'm sorry. 
           She starts crying bitter tears.

           Tam, come on. It was an accident.
          Still Tamara cries. He comforts her. She lets him. He holds 
          her for some time. 

                          ANDY
           I'd better get up to Stonefield. Come
           with me. We'll get this sorted.

           Tamara shakes her head. She separates herself from him and
           stands.

                          ANDY
           Then get Ben to take you to London. 
           Make sure he looks after you.
           Tamara walks a few paces away. She stares straight ahead.

                          TAMARA
           I don't want to be with Ben. 
           She looks back at Andy. He begins to understand. She walks 
           off.

                         

          171B INT. DAY. STONEFIELD. GLEN'S ROOM. 171B 

           Glen, sick with dread, is drying his face with a towel. He 
           picks up his muddy shoes and clothes, wraps them in a bag and 
           shoves them in his case. 
           His eyes alight on his poster of Thomas Hardy. He pulls it 
           down. 

                         

          172 EXT. DAY. WINNARDS FARM - THE GARDEN. 172 

           Ben and the girls have dug a grave for Boss. Casey is putting
           flowers on the top. Ben starts to cry like a broken-hearted 
           little boy. Jody instinctively puts her arms round him. The
           girls are immensely moved. Jody looks over at Casey. She

                          MOUTHS:

                          JODY
           Pap me! Pap me!
           Casey waits until Ben is not looking. Then she takes pictures
           with her mobile phone. Jody cradles Ben in her arms, doing
           her best moved-but-sultry pose. Casey tries not to laugh.
           Jody is ecstatic. The man of her dreams is in her arms. Her
           wish has come true.

                         

          172A EXT. DAY. STONEFIELD - THE COURTYARD. 172A

           An ambulance and two police cars are in the courtyard. The
           police are carrying the corpse, covered in blankets. Andy
           crosses the yard to the barn. He bumps into Glen furtively
           coming out of the door. Glen's case is packed.

                          ANDY
           What are you doing?
           Glen can't look him in the eye.

           I'm so sorry.
           Beth looks up at him despairingly.

                          GLEN

           What I don't understand is why was

           For a moment, confession and silence hang in the balance.
           Glen opens his mouth to speak.

                          GLEN (CONT'D)
           You live in the country. You share
           it with those dangerous beasts. And
           when they're scared, they run. Like
           we do...
           Glen is full of horror at his lie.
           But Beth is only grateful.

           Glen. Stay with me.
           Her eyes, still red with grief, are full of their future
           together.
           Glen nods. He will stay. He wants it all.
           Beth leans into him, seeking comfort. He puts his arms around
           her, his face ashen with the weight of his secret.
           As he holds her, he looks around the room. Nicholas is
           everywhere, glaring down at him from photographs.

           Tamara is in the garden, a strip on her nose. She sees Andy
           in the dusk. He's leaning against the gate watching her.

                          TAMARA
           Don't say anything.

           Kind of suits you. And I always did

           They are in each others arms. The embrace lasts and lasts.
           Tamara is leading Andy up to the house.

          As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to
          slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States.
          The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through
          the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see
          large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's
          winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one
          small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear
          the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It has been said that magic vanished from
           our world a long time ago. And that
           humanity can no longer fulfill its
           desires through the power of wishes.
           To those who have lost the wondrous
           vision of childhood eyes, submitted here
           is the story of a little boy, and a
           magical Christmas wish that changed his
           life forever.

           It began in 1985, in a town just outside
           Boston.
                         
          We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at
          each other in the street.
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           It was Christmas Eve, and all the
           children were in high spirits. That
           special time of year when Boston children
           gather together and beat up the Jewish
           kids.
                         
          Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled,
          and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball-
          throwing kids points at the sled kid.

                          KID #1
           It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know
           what I'm gonna get him?

           Why would Jesus want that?

           Get him!
                         
          The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle
          him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy
          and innocent-looking) approaches the melee.

           But there was one child who wasn't in
           such good spirits. Little John Bennett.
           That one boy in every neighborhood who
           just has a tough time making friends.
                         
                          JOHN
           Hey guys, can I play?
                         
          The kids all look at him.
                         
                          KID #1/#2/#3
           Get outta here! / Get outta here,
           Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett!
                         
          The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John.
                         
                          GREENBAUM
           Yeah, Bennett, get outta here!
                         
          The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly
          walks back toward his house.

           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           John longed with all his heart for that
           one true friend that he could call his
           own. And he knew that if he ever found
           that friend, he would never let him go.
                         
          John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands,
          looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all
          playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing
          snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A
          WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with
          open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun.

           And for little John Bennett, Christmas
           Day brought a very special new arrival.
                         
          John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a
          present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear.
          The boy holds it with delight.
                         
                          JOHN

          John hugs the teddy bear. It makes a cutesy, high-
          pitched "I wuv you" sound. John gasps with delight.

           John became instantly attached to Teddy.
           There was something about that bear that
           made him feel as if he finally had a
           friend with whom he could share his
           deepest secrets.

          Teddy looks back at him, expressionless.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           Last week, my mom and dad took me to the
           park for a picnic. And they have this
           duck pond there, and... when nobody was
           looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it
           at a duck. Was that mean?
                         
          He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the "I wuv you"
          sound.

           I love you too, Teddy!
                         
          John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with
          it.
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           You know... I wish you could really talk

           friends forever and ever.

           It is an unbelievably impressive

          we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by
          through the opening.

          but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John
          bolts upright and looks around, frantically.

          assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the
          night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE
          FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around.

          face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once.

          John, Lori, and Ted play miniature golf. Lori putts the
          ball, which rolls to the lip of the cup. She reacts,
          disappointed. Ted makes a graceful leg sweep, pushing
          the ball into the cup "accidentally". Lori smiles. John
          smiles back at her. Ted winks.

          John, Lori and Ted sit outside at a table, each holding
          an ice cream cone. They stare deadpan at the camera,
          each with a dab of ice cream on their noses, and a dab of
          ice cream on their upper lips.

          John and Lori paint the apartment walls. Lori sneaks up
          behind John, and paints his back. John turns around and
          grabs her. They scuffle playfully, and then kiss. We
          ANGLE ON Ted, who stands on a little stepladder hammering
          a "Home Sweet Home" picture into the wall. He steps
          back, but realizes he has nailed his hand to the wall.
          He tugs, slips, and the ladder falls. Ted hangs there
          like an idiot.

          bottle on the table in front of them.

          CLOSE ON a bong. PULL OUT TO REVEAL Ted, who inhales,
          his snout inside the tube. Ted sits on the sofa, and for
          the first time, we see Ted in his present day form: he is
          ratty, patched-up, and worn-looking. He has a couple
          stains, some small spots of exposed stuffing, and there's
          evidence of some half-assed sewing. It's obvious he's
          been around for three decades. He and John, who sits
          next to him, are both clearly stoned as we join them.
          John, for his part, looks far too comfortable in the too-
          worn Red Sox T-shirt he wears. He eats directly from a
          box of Fruity Pebbles. Reaching in for a last handful,
          he finds the box almost empty. He raises it to empty the
          remainder into his mouth, and accidentally pours Fruity
          Pebbles all over his face. It doesn't faze him much,
          though, as he brushes them off. It's quite obvious that
          this is a guy who has never really given up his
          childhood... and has never given up his teddy bear. Ted
          passes the bong to John.

          drives (his paws grip the wheel). We then cut to an

          reveal it crossing Boston's huge suspension bridge.

          the brakes. ANGLE OUTSIDE THE CAR. John gets out, and
          looks at the damage.

           up to handle not fucking up my job, but
           you happen to be the least fucked-up

          We see his coworker, Guy (a burly Patrick-Warburton
          type), handing a car key and a rental envelope to a
          pleasant-looking couple. He looks tired, disheveled, and
          a little bruised.
                         
                          GUY
           There you go, here's your key and rental
           agreement, and a complimentary map of
           Boston. Thanks for choosing Liberty,
           drive safely.

           I don't know, man. I got fuckin' wasted
           last night, and my phone says I texted
           somebody at 3:15 asking them to beat me
           up. And then at 4:30 I texted the same
           person saying thanks.

           I don't know. I dig chicks. I don't
           remember any of it, I was so fucked up.
           I might be gay, I don't know. You mind
           covering for me for a bit? I'm gonna go
           lay down in the john.

           No, it's gotta have a "ski" at the end.

          Lori's boss REX (asshole handsome, mid-30's, expensive
          suit) walks into the office, and approaches the gathering
          of female employees.

           Well hello there. Sorry if I'm

           Channing Tatum's index finger but Lori I

           to get to--

          Lori exits Rex's office. Rex casually gets up, strolls

          John holds up the front portion of the lobster shell,

          We see Lori out on the dance floor, amidst a sea of
          dancing clubgoers. Nearby, we see John dancing with a
          girl, and doing it very badly. He's putting too much
          into it, obviously trying to impress her. The girl is
          gamely tolerating it, but is clearly not digging the
          moves. John thrusts his butt back in one move,
          accidentally bumping a girl behind him with enough force
          to send her sprawling on the floor. As the crowd reacts
          to this, we see that it is Lori. She starts to get up,
          when John turns and rushes to help her to her feet.

          She sits down. He reaches into a nearby glass, pulls out
          a handful of ice, and wraps it in a napkin. He puts it
          against her head. She inhales sharply for a moment.

          struts up to the dance floor, locks eyes with Lori. They
          circle one another for a beat. John suavely takes off
          his jacket, twirls it in the air a few times, and tosses
          it O.S. He then strikes a "finger up" disco pose, with a
          bullet SFX. He and Lori begin disco dancing
          simultaneously. He jumps up, locking his legs around
          Lori, who spins him around in circles, as we cut back to:

                          LORI
           No, we didn't.
                         
                          JOHN
           --But, I got you something anyway, in
           clear violation of the "no gift" rule.
                         
                          LORI
           There was no such rule.
          John reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a small
          box. Lori looks excited.
                         
                          JOHN
           Lori, I've wanted to give this to you for
           a long time.
                         
          John slides the box over to Lori. She picks it up.
                         
                          LORI
           Oh, John.
                         
          Lori unwraps the box and opens it. Inside is a pair of
          nice, but not-super-expensive-looking earrings.
                         
                          JOHN
           Those are the ones you liked, right?
           From that kiosk at the mall?
                          LORI
           Oh. Yeah.
                         
                          JOHN
           Check out the card.
                         
          She opens up the card, which we see as John describes it.
          It says, "Happy 4 year anniversary! Love you."
                         
                          JOHN (CONT'D)
           See, I even wrote the words with
           different colored markers so you wouldn't
           get bored while you were reading it.

          Lori hands John a small box. He opens it up, revealing a
          very nice watch.

          He puts it on his wrist.
                         
                          LORI
           I remember you liked it when you saw Tom
           Brady wearing one in GQ.
                         
                          JOHN
           Yeah, I mean his was analog, but this is
           so awesome, I love it!
          She reacts a bit to this.

           Someday, there's gonna be a ring in
           there. But I wanna wait `til I can get
           you something really special, y'know? I
           just don't have the money right now.
                         
                          LORI

           I want is--
                         
                          JOHN
           I know, but it's important to me that you
           have the engagement ring you deserve.
           And what with the credit bubble... the
           Supreme Court... I mean, look at Haiti.
                          LORI
           Look, I'm only saying this because I love
           you, but that's not realistic. You're
           never gonna have any kind of a career if
           you're always partying and wasting time
           with Ted.
                         
                          JOHN
           Oh, Jesus, here we go--
                         
                          LORI
           John, please get him to find his own
           place, so we can get on with our lives.
                         
                          JOHN

           years from now.

           Lori, we can't talk about this every time
           we go out. Look, he's been my best
           friend since I was eight. And I was not
           a popular child. You have to understand,
           I had no friends before he came along.
           He's the only reason I ever gained any
           fucking confidence. I coulda wound up
           like that Asian kid at Virginia Tech, but
           I didn't. `Cause of him. So, y'know,
           I'm not that psyched to just, like, kick
           him out.
                         
                          LORI
           Well, it's good to know that a talking
           teddy bear is the only thing that kept
           you from gunning down your classmates,
           but John, you're not eight. You're
           thirty-five. And unless you're too blind
           to notice, he's not your only friend
           anymore. You have me. And I love you.
                         
                          JOHN
           I love you, too. You know that.
                         
                          LORI
           Look, I've put the best physical years of
           my life into this. I mean, I'm cute now,
           but in a few years my body's gonna fall
           off a fucking cliff. Things'll be
           hanging and stretching in ways that might
           scare a man. I need to feel secure in
           the fact that you won't leave me when
           that happens.
                         
                          JOHN
           Not only will I not leave you, it's gonna
           be even better. `Cause I can have sex
           with you, and press your arm fat against
           a comic book so I can see it backwards.

           Exactly, and you can do whatever you want
           with the other hand.
                         
                          JOHN
           I can write a novel. Maybe a bestseller.
                         
                          LORI
           We can achieve critical acclaim and
           become rich just by screwing each other.

          Lori punches his number on her cellphone. After a beat,

          apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). Ted sits on
          the sofa with a small group of trashy-looking women.
          They're watching "Romancing the Stone," which plays very
          loudly on the TV.

           Ray. Came in a two-pack with "Jewel of
           the Nile," but I don't know that we'll
           end up watchin' that one.

           this is not so much about the stool in
           the corner, and more about maybe

          observe some of the more bizarre varieties of fish. John
          is oddly restrained. Something is on his mind. As they
          stroll, we see a nearby man keeping an eye on them. He
          seems much more interested in them than in the fish.

           I'm Donny. And this is my boy, Robert.
           I have to tell you, I've been fascinated
           by your story ever since I was a boy. I
           remember seeing you on the Carson show.
           You were just wonderful.

           I'm sorry, little guy, but my bear isn't
           for sale. I've had him since I was about
           your age. He's very special to me.
                         
                          ROBERT

           Don't swear in front of my child. Now.
           We are very interested in the bear. If
           you'd like to work out some sort of
           arrangement, here's my address and phone
           number.
                         
          He writes on a slip of paper and hands it to John. John
          smiles awkwardly and puts it in his wallet.

           Okay. Will do. Here it goes, in the

           important stuff.
                         
          Donny and Robert walk off. Donny turns and steals a
          glance back at Ted as they move off.

          John tugs on one of Ted's arms trying to creep him out.
          He then breaks into a creepy falsetto.

          They exit. After a beat, the pigeon flies into frame,
          slamming right into a fucking tree.

          There's a couch, a coffee table, and a couple of boxes.
          John and Ted put down their boxes, and stand just inside
          the doorway.
                          JOHN
           Well... I guess this is it, huh?

          They awkwardly nod to each other, both knowing that John

          They regard each other for a moment, then John slowly
          turns and walks off down the hall. He turns back to
          smile and wave. From John's POV, we see a diminutive-
          looking Ted give a wan wave back. He looks very alone as
          the camera recedes.

           Listen... I just wanna say thank you.
           What you did with Ted was a big step, and
           I know it wasn't easy, but I just want
           you to know that I love you for it. And,
           I think this a new beginning for our
           relationship.

           most guys couldn't do it.

           guess I take you for granted sometimes.

           No, what I mean is, there's just no
           version of this universe where you and I
           don't end up together. You're

           Fozzie.
          Ted waves to the girl. She waves back. He makes a kissy
          face at her. She giggles and blows him a kiss back. He
          pantomimes hard, thrusting, standing-up sex. Her eyes
          widen for a beat, as she stares, then smiles. He grabs
          an Oh Henry bar, and pantomimes fellatio. The girl
          laughs hysterically. CLOSE ANGLE on Ted, as white liquid
          sprays all over his face from one side, then from the
          other. WIDEN to reveal he's squirting two bottles of

          sees Ted's name pop up, with a photo of Ted smiling open-

           you out, I promise. C'mon, I picked up
           the "Cheers" DVD box set, and supposedly
           everybody talks shit about each other in
           the interviews.

           I gotta duck out for a bit. Lori tried
           to break up a dog fight, and I guess she
           got hurt pretty bad.

           Yeah, she's-- that's the way she is, she
           sees trouble, she tries to help out, and
           I guess one of these dogs clamped his
           jaws on her forearm, and he wouldn't let
           go until the fireman showed up and had to
           stick his finger in his ass.

           That's how they get `em to stop biting,

                          JOHN
           Oh gosh, thank you, sir. I owe you one.
                         
                          THOMAS
           You don't owe me anything, go.

           Was there cocaine on the set of "Cheers"?

                          (LAUGHS WARMLY)
           Yes, there was quite a lot of cocaine. I

           king. I was king of the eighties. I was
           Ted fucking Danson. And not only that, I

           Hey, isn't this great? The four of us
           here, having dinner together? Lori,
           how've you been? Haven't seen you in
           forever.

           Um, I've been good. Not much going on.
           My company's 20th anniversary is next
           week, that's something.

           Company's turnin' 20, eh? So you can
           bang it but you can't get it drunk.
                         
          Tami-Lynn laughs heartily at this, as does John. Lori
          isn't quite as delighted.

                          (VISIBLY ANNOYED)
           I'm surprised John didn't tell you
           already. Seems like you guys have seen
           each other every day since you moved out.

           Well, it's funny, usually the first item
           on our agenda is "what's goin' on with
           Lori?" So I'm surprised that one slipped
           through the cracks.
                         
                          JOHN

                          JOHN
           Oh my god, remember, Ted, last week we
           were talking about... how... neat all of
           Lori's shoes are?
                         
                          TED
           That was a lengthy conversation.
                          JOHN
           And we were saying like, a lot of women
           look like unsteady horses when they wear
           high heels, but Lori has a sort of...
           regal... trot.
                         
                          TED

           Oh my god yes. You canter.

          He walks over to the line. A GUY IN LINE turns and
          notices him.
                         
           GUY IN LINE
           Hey, dude, you think you could open more
           than one register? There's like a
           thousand people here!
                         
                          FRANK
           There's supposed to be three registers
           open, for god's sake!
                         
          He looks around, aggravated, for a moment, then storms
          off toward the back. He looks around the butcher's
          counter and produce area, then walk into the back
          storeroom.
                         
                         
          INT. STOREROOM - MOMENTS LATER
                         
          Frank opens the door, and reacts with shock. REVERSE
          ANGLE where we see Ted on top of Tami Lynn, who is almost
          naked. He is doing a very close approximation of banging
          her wildly. We see his furry bear butt pumping away,
          with its little tail on the end. Frank screams in shock
          and horror.

          INT. FRANK'S OFFICE - SHORTLY AFTER
                         
          Frank sits at his desk, addressing Ted.
                         
                          FRANK
           You had sexual intercourse with a
           coworker in a storeroom filled with
           produce that we sell to the public.
                         
                          TED
           Yes.
                         
                          FRANK
                          (BEAT)
           That took guts. We need guts. I'm
           promoting you.
                          TED
           Oh.
                         
                         
          EXT. GROCERY STORE - LATER THAT NIGHT
                         
          We see the "CLOSED" sign on the door. Ted exits,
          finishing off a bottle of beer. He walks around to the
          dumpster alley, and lines up for a Kareem-style sky hook
          shot into a trash can. He takes the shot:
                         
                          TED
           Kareem!
                         
          The bottle smashes off the side of the can, and shatters.
                         
                          TED (CONT'D)
           You suck, Kareem.
          We hear a soft footstep somewhere O.S. Ted turns and
          looks around. There appears to be no one in the
          darkness.
                         
                          TED (CONT'D)
           Hello?
                         
          No answer. He looks around for a beat, and finds
          nothing. He turns... and finds himself facing Donny, who
          stands eerily lit by a single outdoor wall bulb.
                         
                          DONNY

                          DONNY
           I can offer you six thousand dollars in
           railroad bonds. They were left to me by
           my father.
                          TED
           Well, gosh, you know, since I just
           returned from active duty in the Civil
           War, that sounds really appealing. Oh
           wait, no, that was a hundred and fifty
           years ago, and I don't give a shit.
                         
          Tami-Lynn approaches.

           Teddy, come on-- we're gonna have pop
           tarts and cigarettes with my mom before
           she goes to work.

           Yeah, I'm comin', sweetheart.

           Yeah, my dance card is quite full, so I'm

           like to thank you for creepin' up my
           night, and... Jesus be with you. In
           Christ.
                         
          Ted hurries off. ANGLE ON DONNY, who looks eerily
          determined.

          John and Lori walk up to the fabulously expansive house
          in Cambridge. It's a very impressive estate with no
          expense spared.
                         
                          LORI

                          JOHN
           Yeah, me too. Is it cool if I kick your
           boss' ass? That won't affect your
           workplace chemistry, will it?

           There she is! I was worried you weren't

          INT. REX'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
                         
          The party is a very costly-looking event: uniformed
          servers walking around with trays of cocktails and hors
          d'ouvres, tables laden with lavish-looking food displays
          and floral arrangements, a 20-piece big band, and
          hundreds of guests. A large banner reads "Happy 20th
          Anniversary, Plymouth Public Relations."
                         
                          REX
           Oh, here come the ladies.
                         
          Gina, Michelle, and Tracy approach. Everyone adlibs
          their hellos to John and Lori. A waiter walks by with a
          tray of champagne. Lori and the girls each take a glass.

          Rex and John are walking up the stairs to the second
          floor of his house. Rex points out various items bought
          at auction. John is visibly unenthused. He does not
          like this guy, and definitely does not trust him.
                         
                          REX
           ...and that's a Wade Boggs autographed
           bat. Just barely outbid Phil Donahue for
           that at auction.
                         
                          JOHN
           Wow, cool.
                         
                          REX
           Yeah, cool. And those boxing gloves were
           worn by Joe Louis in his first fight.
           (passing an abstract
                          PAINTING)
           This is art. Do you get it?
           (passing wall mounted pair of
                          GLASSES) )
           These were John Lennon's glasses. Worth
           about two million dollars.
           (passing photo on wall) )
           That's me and Tom Skerritt. Oh, and
           check this out.
                         
          Rex indicates a small, bronze-colored item on a stand.
                         
                          REX (CONT'D)

           John. There are moments in a man's life:
           Nathan Hale, "I regret that I have but
           one life to give for my country." Alan
           Hale, "Yes, I accept the role of the

           Rex. I gotta go. I'll be back in thirty
           minutes tops, but Lori cannot find out.
           She absolutely cannot know I was gone.

          John sprints out of the house and runs down the walkway.
          He leaps over a hedge toward the parking area. He slides
          across the hood of Lori's car, gets in, quickly starts
          the car, and backs out.

          slo-mo to face John. He is inexplicably still sporting
          the same hairstyle he had in the "Flash Gordon" movie.

          ON JOHN - He continues to stare in frozen awe.

          POV, but he is now dressed in the Flash Gordon costume.

          off. She is clearly hurt, and on the verge of tears.

           Jesus, Lori was right. I should have
           stopped hanging out with you a long time
           ago. I'm never gonna have a life with you
           around. I'm 35 years old and I'm going
           nowhere. All I do is smoke pot and watch
           movies with a teddy fucking bear. And

          John sulks on the bed, leafing through a Tintin comic
          book. There's a knock at the door.

          slides open from the outside, and Ted tumbles in, landing
          on the floor, soaked.

          Ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him,
          wrapping his whole body around John's face and head, like
          the facehuggers from "Aliens." John stumbles around the
          room, trying to pry Ted off. Eventually, he stumbles
          into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door,
          shattering it. He and Ted exchange punches to the face.
          John lands a particularly hard one, which sends Ted
          flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. Ted
          hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. John
          stumbles to his feet. Ted scrambles across the bed,
          reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a Bible.
          John staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be
          pelted in the head as Ted throws the Bible at him.

          Ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and
          the phone. John and Ted stare at each other for a beat,
          each one breathing heavily (Ted is now on the floor).
          John charges at Ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling
          him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the
          process. John and Ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in
          a realistic-as-possible fistfight. Each one gets a
          number of blows in. John throws Ted off him, and back
          onto the bed. Ted taunts him.

          John jumps at Ted, throwing a jab at him. But Ted
          dodges, and John's fist goes into the wall above the
          headboard. He struggles to pull free as he flails about
          with his other hand, grabbing at Ted. Ted dodges again,
          and scrambles up John's head, jumping up and grabbing the
          chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing Ted
          to swing back and forth. John pulls free, and stumbles
          backward off the bed. He notices a tall, free-standing
          lamp in the corner. He pulls the plug out of the wall,
          and uses the lamp to take a swing at Ted. Ted swings out
          of the way. John takes a second swing, but the lamp cord
          catches on the fan's motor. The lamp is ripped from
          John's grasp, it swings around through the air, and
          cracks him in the side of the head. John goes down,
          whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the
          bed. He howls in pain as he lies on his stomach,
          clutching his head. Ted takes advantage of this. He
          jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the
          clock radio next to the bed. He jumps down to the floor,
          yanks John's pants partway down, and starts whipping his
          bare ass with the antenna. John yells in fury, and kicks
          blindly at Ted. He turns over, kicking ted in the face,
          and kicking the cabinet that the TV is on.

          on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily.
          Ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over
          to him. Both breathe heavily. John's breathing
          deteriorates into sobs.

           Well, you're probably not used to seeing
           me fully clothed.

           Me and Norah met in 2002 at a party at
           Belinda Carlisle's house and we had
           awkward, fuzzy sex in the coatroom.

           Okay, I'm gonna give my chops a rest here
           and invite a friend of mine up to the

           Oh my god.
                         
          John takes center stage, and looks down at Lori.
                         
                          JOHN
           Uh, hi. Um... This is for Lori Collins.
           Because I love her. This song always
           reminds me of the most important night of
           my life. The night we met. It's the
           theme song from the movie "Octopussy."
                         
          The band begins playing. "All Time High". Inexplicably,
          Norah is playing the saxophone with a pair of shades on.

           You're an asshole!
                         
          John flinches as he raises the mic stand off the floor at
          the last second, so the base is sticking out
          horizontally. The crazy guy runs right into it, bashing
          himself in the face. He goes down, unconscious and
          bleeding. Everyone gasps as the music stops.

           Someone call an ambulance!
                         
          The crowd is now shouting angrily at John. But he is
          only focused n one spot in the crowd. He sees that Lori
          and Rex are gone. Almost oblivious to the rest of the
          frenzy, he sighs, heartbroken. A couple of concert
          security personnel haul him offstage.

           That was insane. Did you see the way
           that guy's body hit the ground? It was
           like a rag doll!
                          LORI
           Yeah, I'd rather just not talk about it.

                          LORI
           Nope, I think I'd rather you just take me

           Alright, alright, I get it. I don't
           blame you. When you think about it, it
           was actually really unfair of him to
           embarrass you like that.
                         
                          LORI
           Just to be clear, I am not embarrassed.
           Listen, John and I may have our problems
           but at least he tried. You know what? I
           don't feel like talking to you about
           this.

          still reeling with disgust from her encounter with Rex.
          After a few moments, there's a knock at the door. Lori
          sighs with annoyance, and walks to the door, still in her
          towel. She looks through the peephole, but there's no
          one there. She opens the door cautiously, and looks out
          into the hall. There's no one there.

           was a huge misunderstanding, and I'm
           ready to change. But I don't think you
           wanna hear any of that crap. I'm not
           gonna try and get you to take me back.
           Why would you? I've been a really shitty
           boyfriend for the last four years. I
           don't deserve you. I didn't take our
           relationship seriously, even though I
           love you more than life itself. All I
           want is... just to end on good terms.

          shabby-looking Boston home (think Buffalo Bill in
          "Silence of the Lambs"). It's close to one end of the
          base of a bridge.

          Donny carries the sack inside, and unceremoniously dumps
          Ted onto the floor. Ted looks around. It's just as
          shitty on the inside as on the outside. On the walls,
          there are a disturbing number of newspaper clippings,
          photo spreads, etc. Most are from press from Ted's media
          heyday, but some are photographs of Ted and John out in
          public that Donny clearly took himself.

          with some toys strewn about. A wooden rocking horse with
          a wig stands in the corner.

           most amazing, most wonderful thing I'd
           ever seen. Ever. And I asked my father
           if I could have a magical teddy bear,
           too. And he said no. And I was
           heartbroken. I decided that if I ever
           had a son, I would never say no to him.

          door. He has it in sight on the far end of the living
          room, but when he gets closer to the living room doorway,
          he sees that Donny is sitting in an armchair, watching
          The Incredible Hulk (the old TV show). Ted darts back
          into the hallway before he's seen, but in the process,
          bumps into a small table with a lamp and a couple knick
          knacks on it. One of them, a small ceramic penguin,
          falls over, making a sound. Donny turns and looks in the
          direction of the hallway.

           Ted, are you making friends with Robert?
                         
          Ted looks panicky, not knowing what to do. After a beat,
          Donny leans forward as if he's about to get up.

           Okay.
          Ted breathes a sigh of relief, and walks the other way
          down the hall. He passes a door. He opens it, but it's
          just a storage closet. He's about to shut it, but
          notices a stapler amidst the odds and ends. He hastily
          begins stapling his ear back on.

          he's about to get up, but he then settles back in.
                         
          ANGLE BACK ON TED, who puts on last staple in.
          Satisfied, he exits the closet and continues down the
          hall.

          Ted looks around, and spots a phone on the counter. He
          jumps up, grabs the handset, and jumps back down. He
          dials John's number.

          He pauses, then gets into the car and sits down next to
          her. She prepares to speak, but John's phone rings. He
          shuts it off without looking at it.

          John's phone rings. He looks down at it, annoyed. It
          reads "Unknown caller." He silences it.

          of the passenger's side window.
                         
          JOHN'S POV - They pass the alley, where we see Donny's
          car heading out of the alleyway.

          The car slows down, and John sees Donny's car make the
          turn out onto the street. Ted is looking out the back.

          Robert and Donny both hear this. Donny looks in his side-
          view mirror, just in time to see Lori's car swing a U-
          turn to pursue them. Donny speeds up, and races off up
          the street. Lori's car speeds up in pursuit.

          Ted continues to stare out the back. He then notices a
          crowbar on the floor in the way back. He grabs it, and
          takes a hard swing at the rear window. It does not
          break. Robert sees this, and scrambles to undo his seat
          belt.

          Ted takes another swing at the window. The glass does
          not break. Robert undoes his seat belt, and scrambles
          back. He grabs Ted, who drops the crowbar. He starts to
          pull Ted back over into the back seat, but Ted manages to
          wriggle free.

          Ted grabs the crowbar, and again takes a swing at the

          and climbs up onto the edge of the window.

          the head, sending him tumbling onto the floor. We see
          that Robert has struck him hard with the crowbar.

           No! You're being bad!
                         
          Ted reaches down and grabs the crowbar with one arm, and
          brandishes it threateningly at Robert.

          Robert backs off in fear. Ted climbs out onto the rear
          of the car, and positions himself to make the jump. He
          tosses the crowbar away into the tunnel. John and Lori
          speed up, getting closer to him, so he can make the jump.

          Lori's car moves closer to Donny's. There's a tense
          moment with some back and forth cutting... and then Ted
          makes the jump! He lands on the hood of Lori's car, and
          slides across, grabbing the windshield wiper to avoid
          falling off. He pulls himself back up. John and Lori
          breathe energetic sighs of relief.

          Donny sees what's happening in his side mirror. He puts
          his foot on the brakes, and the car screeches as it
          drastically reduces speed. John's car slams into Donny's
          causing Ted to go flying back through open rear window of
          Donny's car, past Robert (who is still in the way back)
          and tumbling into the back seat.

          Ted gets his bearings, and notices the sack that Donny
          captured him in, lying on the floor. He looks up at
          Donny for a beat, then grabs the sack.
                         
          ANGLE ON Donny driving. Suddenly, Ted jumps up from
          behind, and throws the sack over Donny's head, bracing
          himself against the back of the front seat. Donny yells
          in anger, and pulls at Ted, trying to get him off.

          his head, and reacts as he looks out the front window.
          He's approaching the end of the tunnel, and there is
          opposing traffic moving in the other direction.

          Donny swerves past the traffic, narrowly avoiding
          clipping one of the cars. A moment later, John and Lori
          come racing out of the tunnel. However, a truck drives
          through the intersection, stopping them in their tracks.

          He looks around, and spots a "Club" underneath the seat.
          He glances at Donny, whose eyes are on the road. Ted
          grabs the club, and scrambles up the seat, taking a swing
          at Donny. Donny ducks out of the way, and tries to slap
          Ted away as Ted continues to takes swings at him. A few
          of them land, eventually drawing blood. Donny smacks Ted
          away. Ted tumbles back onto the passenger's seat. Then,
          with determination, he grabs the Club again, scurries in
          front of Donny, and locks the Club onto the steering
          wheel with a snap! Donny's eyes widen as Ted scrambles
          into the back seat. Donny tries to turn the wheel, but
          can't.

          Donny's car swerves out of control, veering up the
          street, and crashing into a lamppost, fishtailing as it
          impacts. The airbags go off as the car comes to a stop.
          Taking advantage of the situation, Ted scrambles out the
          back window. He catches his fur on a jagged shard of
          glass, slightly ripping his side. He hangs and struggles
          for a bit, then drops to the ground. He sways a bit.
          TED'S POV - We see that his vision is swimming slightly.
          That little rip has done something... He shakes it off,
          and runs up the sidewalk. ANGLE ON DONNY, who scrambles
          out of the wrecked car, followed by Robert. They chase
          Ted up the street. Ted spots a garage with the door
          slightly open. He squeezes himself underneath, and
          disappears inside.
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - They screech to a stop behind
          Donny's car. They hurry out, just in time to see Donny
          and Robert duck underneath the door. They run up the
          sidewalk after them.

          Ted runs down a ramp, looking frantically around for an
          escape route. He darts off to the left, sprinting up a
          ramp, followed by Donny and Robert. Ted stops at a red
          metal fence, and squeezes through, rushing up the stairs
          on the other side. Donny reaches the fence, but with his
          larger size he has to climb over the top, which slows him
          down a bit.
                         
          ANGLE ON JOHN AND LORI - We catch them ducking in through
          the garage door, and running inside. They look around
          for a beat. ANGLE ON ROBERT, who turns and sees them
          (Donny has already made it over the fence). ANGLE BACK
          ON JOHN.

          John and Lori run up the ramp, leaving a stunned Robert
          behind. When they reach the red fence, they look around,

          continues up the ramp (in the wrong direction) with Lori
          just behind him.

          PIVOTS 180 DEGREES and ascends to reveal the expanse of
          FENWAY PARK down below. A few lights are on, and one
          lone maintenance man sweeps the dirt. Donny emerges from
          the stairwell, which snaps Ted out of it. Ted sprints
          past the front row of seats, and comes to a dead end. He
          has nowhere else to go. With Donny closing in, Ted
          scurries out onto the ledge, and pulls himself up onto
          the lighting tower. He looks down. From TED'S POV, it's
          a long drop. Donny reaches out to grab him, but can't
          quite reach. Donny glances down at the drop for a beat,
          then pulls himself out onto the ledge to go after Ted.
          Ted climbs farther up the tower.

          John and Lori emerge into the lower seating section, and
          run down the aisle, looking around with desperation.

          John turns and sees the drama playing out on the distant
          lighting tower.
                         
                          JOHN
           Oh Jesus...
                          (THEN)
           Stay here.

           STAY THERE!!
                         
          He turns and runs back up the aisle, toward the
          concession area.

          Ted is starting to gain ground, but he slips, and falls
          back down. He's about to pulls himself up again, when
          Donny grabs one of his legs.
                         
                         
          EXT. LOWER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
                         
          John continues up the aisle as fast as he can move.
                         
                         
          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Ted struggles to pull himself from Donny's grasp, but he
          can't. CLOSE UP ON TED'S SIDE - The small rip from
          earlier begins to tear again. CLOSE UP ON TED'S FACE -
          His eyes go wide, and for a moment, his face freezes with
          fear. TED'S POV - His vision swims a bit more. He knows
          this is not good...
                         
                         
          EXT. CONCESSION AREA - CONTINUOUS
                         
          John reaches the top of the lower seating area, and
          sprints past the concession bar, heading for the stairs.

          The struggle continues. As Ted tries to pull himself
          free, the rip gets bigger. He reacts again, and again we
          see his vision swimming even more.

          The struggle continues. Ted tries to pull himself up,
          but he's visibly weakened and his hands are slipping.
                         
          EXT. - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
                         
          Ted manages to pull free from Donny. He uses all his
          depleted strength to pull himself farther up.
                         
                         
          EXT. UPPER SEATING AREA - CONTINUOUS
                         
          John runs past the top of the stairwell, and sprints over
          toward the lighting tower, just in time to see...
                         
                         
          EXT. LIGHTING TOWER - CONTINUOUS
          Donny makes one final reach for Ted. He grabs Ted by the
          foot again, and pulls hard. With one great RRRIIIIIIP,
          Ted tears into two pieces. As John watches in shock, Ted
          falls through the air in SLO-MOTION, a shower of white
          stuffing descending with him. Lori watches with a hand
          over her mouth. The two halves of Ted land, along with
          the scattered white stuffing. Donny, still hanging,
          stares down at the fallen teddy bear. He starts pulling
          himself back over the ledge.
                         
          We lead and follow John as he runs back down through the
          stadium with desperate numbness. Lori climbs over the
          edge of the seating area, and runs toward him as well.
          ANGLE BACK ON DONNY, who pulls himself back over into the
          upper seating area. He hears the sound of a cop siren,
          and peers over the edge of the stadium. Seeing a cop car
          pull up far below, he makes a break for it.

          Down below, Ted's top half lies on the grass, looking
          around in a daze, like a badly wounded soldier for whom
          there is not much hope. John and Lori race to his side,
          and kneel down.

                          JOHN
           Lori, get the stuffing! Get it all!

          both drenched from the rain. Lori frantically searches
          drawers for sewing materials. She finds a needle and
          thread, and John puts Ted on the table. Lori starts to
          sew him up as John watches intently.

          She continues sewing, until she is all finished. They
          wait. Ted still does not move. John and Lori lower
          their heads.

          John sits on the couch, head in hands. Ted still lies on
          the coffee table. Lori enters with a blanket, and drapes
          it around him. She sits down next to him, bringing part
          of the blanket around herself. She places a hand on his
          shoulder.

          She gently puts an arm around him. There is a
          thunderclap outside. John does not react.

          John is asleep, but we see that Lori is still lying
          awake. She sighs restlessly, and gets up. She walks
          over to the window, and looks out.

          from that night when John was a child. As before, there
          is a small clear patch in the center. A shooting star
          whizzes by through the opening.

          eyes snap open.

           this line with addition:) It was your
           wish.
                         
                          TEDDY
           (smiling, speechless)
           Son of a bitch...You wished for my life
           back.
                         
          She smiles at him.
                         
                          LORI
           No. I wished for my life back. Because
           I love you both.
                         
          John goes to her, and kisses her passionately.

           Oh my god, do you know how awesome it was
           punching a kid? I felt so powerful! I
           mean if that's what it's like to hit a
           woman, watch out, I liked it.

           And, I want you to know that... I'm
           probably never gonna be any more than a
           guy who rents cars, but... I don't care.
           You're the only thing that matters in my
           life.

                          JOHN
           And after last night, I... I don't ever
           want to lose anyone who matters to me
           ever again. I'm not gonna wait any
           longer for my life to start. Lori...
           will you marry me?

          John and Lori kiss as we pull away...
                         
           NARRATOR (V.O.)
           And so John, Lori, and Ted lived happily
           ever after, having discovered at last
           that all they really needed was each
           other. John and Lori were married in a
           beautiful ceremony in Cambridge, by a
           very special Justice of the Peace.

          INT. CHURCH - DAY
                         
          We hear the Flash Gordon Wedding March as we ANGLE ON Sam
          J. Jones standing in robes at the altar. Ted, in a tux,
          stands in the best man's position. John stands on the
          steps smiling and looking out as we cut to...
                         
          ANGLE ON Lori, walking down the aisle in a wedding dress,
          smiling warmly. TIME CUT to shortly after, as Sam Jones
          addresses the two of them, standing at the altar.
                         
                          SAM JONES
           I now pronounce you man and wife. You
           may kiss the bride.
                         
          John and Lori kiss each other. They turn and wave to the
          cheering crowd. Ted waves happily to John, who waves
          back. John and Lori run down the aisle joyfully, passing
          pews full of people from the movie: Lori's co-workers,
          John's co-workers, (Guy sitting with HIS BOYFRIEND, Alix
          and Tanya, etc.).

          John and Lori come running out of the church, as the
          crowd throws rice at them. They run to a waiting limo
          with a "Just Married" sign on the back. John gets in,
          and Lori turns to throw the bouquet toward Gina,
          Michelle, Tracy, and Tanya. Tanya catches it. She turns
          and smiles at Alix. Then suddenly, Tami-Lynn bursts into
          frame, punching Tanya in the jaw. Tanya goes down as
          Tami-Lynn tackles her, and the crowd tries to pull her
          off. ANGLE ON the limo as it pulls away...
                         
          Ted stands next to Sam J. Jones, watching with a smile as
          his best friend heads off.
                         
                          TED

                                                       FADE IN:

EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We push
through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED
PELOQUIN.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           When I was sixteen years old I fell in
           love...

CLOSE ON - RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a
shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.

                        TED
           Hey, Renise.

She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

                        RENISE
           Hey.

                        TED
           So what's up?

                        RENISE
           Eh.

                        TED
           Great. Great.
                 (beat)
           So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you
           wanted to go to the prom you know, with
           me.

Renise looks unenthused.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you
           want.

                        RENISE
           See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that
           this guy I like was gonna ask me.

                        TED
           Uh-huh.

                        RENISE
           Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what
           happens there...But that sounds great,
           yeah.

Ted nods, confused.

                        TED
           Okay.
                 (beat)
           So is that a yes or a no?

                        RENISE
           I think I was very clear, Ted. If
           everything else falls apart, maybe.

Renise throws down her butt and storms off.

                        TED
           I'm gonna hold you to that.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT

ANGLE ON - a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the
school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a
bad bone in her body.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our
           little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two
           years earlier.

She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she
           had a faceful of eyes that promised you a
           better life if you could only know her.

As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. He's
sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom
           with?

Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.

                        TED
           Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You
           know, not my style.

                        FRIEND #2
           You have a style?

                        FRIEND #1
           Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?

                        TED
                 (perks up)
           Who?

Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

                        FRIEND #1
           Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you
           spend enough fucking time with her.

The guys LAUGH.

                        TED
                 (out of ammo but doesn't
                  know it)
           Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own
           palm?

His friends stare at him.

                        FRIEND #1
           Clever. I like the way you just spun that
           around on me.

Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #2
           I wonder who she's going with.

                        FRIEND #1
           Some guy named Woogie.

                        TED
           Who?

                        FRIEND #1
           Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.

This irks Ted.

                        TED
           Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like
           a loser.

                        FRIEND #1
           Loser? Woogie was all-state football and
           and basketball and valedictorian of his
           class.

                        FRIEND #2
           I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton
           but he's going to Europe first to model.

This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.

                        FRIEND #3
           Yeah and he's got a huge cock.

Everyone looks at him.

                        FRIEND #3 (cont'd)
           I heard.

Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, check it out.

THEIR POV - A large, goofy YOUNG MAN with an unfashionable
crewcut comes walking up the street. He's in his early twenties
and though the weather is mild he's WEARING EARMUFFS. He
approaches a GROUP OF KIDS sitting on a car hood.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #2
           No.

The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

ON CAR HOOD KIDS 
                        CAR HOOD KID #1
                 (to his buddies)
           This guy must be in the 'tard squad.
                 (to Ear-Muff Guy)
           Hey, buddy, come here, I think I know where

The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #1
           Yeah, I seen it. That girl over there, she
           has it.

Car Hood Kid #1 points to a BUSTY GIRL leaning against another car
talking to her large BOYFRIEND.

boyfriend.

           You seen my pecker?

                        GIRL
           What?!

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

                        BOYFRIEND
           You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!

The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about
to pummel him when Ted intervenes.

                        TED
           Take it easy, Smokey.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!

                        TED
           All right, just be cool.
                 (under breath)
           He looks like he's not all there, you know
           what I mean?

A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           Get the fuck out of my way, man!

Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff
Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.

                        MARY
           What's going on here?

She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Are you all right?

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           Mary, you seen my baseball?

                        MARY
           No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,
           Warren, you know you're not supposed to
           leave the yard by yourself.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
                 (to Mary)
           You know him?

                        MARY
           He's my brother.

           Oh.
                 (beat)
           I didn't realize he was...you know...

At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the
school, along with most of the crowd.

Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.

                        MARY
           You okay?

HER POV - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes
himself off.

                        TED
           Oh yeah. Fine.

                        MARY
           Thanks a lot, Ted.

CLOSE ON - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary
helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of
           my best friends didn't know my name.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags
behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.

                        MARY
           Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt
           yourself?

                        TED
           No, it's an old football injury.

                        MARY
           Oh, are you on the team?

                        TED
           No, a couple of the players and me were
           joking around and, uh, I fell off the
           school.

Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride?

                        MARY
           Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.

Warren pats his back again.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride.

                        TED

           I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

                        MARY
           Oh he can hold you. He weighs
           two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

                        TED
           A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

Ted hops onto Warren's back.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Giddy-up.

Warren walks about five feet and stops.

                        WARREN
           My turn now.

Off Ted's reaction, we

Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill
with Warren on his back.

           We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

                        WARREN
           Giddy-up.

Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary looks
on, amused.

                        MARY
           So who you taking to the prom?

                        TED
           Huh?

                        MARY
           The prom--you going?

                        TED
           Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty
           dumb.

                        MARY
           'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go
           if you weren't already taking someone.

                        TED
           I mean dumb in the sense that they only
           happen once a year.

She smiles at this.

           From that moment on the guys at school
           looked at me in a whole new light.

                        FRIEND #1
           Because you're a loser, and in some warped
           way this gives you a momentary sense of
           worth.

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station
wagon.

EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT

Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Yeah? What do you want?

                        TED
           Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take
           Mary to the prom.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She
           just left for the prom with her boyfriend
           Woogie.

Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing
MARY'S MOM.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.
           Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a
           joke a minute.

                        TED
           Oh.
                 (relieved)
           Oh, that's a good one.

INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren.

Warren doesn't look his way.

Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors
had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe
his eyes.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           Hi, Mary.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both
           barrels from the Wisenheimer here.

                        MARY
           Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?

Mary's Dad shrugs.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

                        WARREN
                 (not looking up)
           'Bout ten times.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren, I think I know where your
           baseball is.

This finally gets Warren's attention.

                        WARREN
           You seen my baseball?

We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket
and palm it in his hand.

                        TED
           Well, if it's a big white one with red
           stitching, I think I saw it right behind
           your ear ..

Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES A
SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.

                        MARY
           Warren!!!

Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.

ON THE BASEBALL - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right
next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.

BACK TO SCENE - In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and
DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to
free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN IN A
HEADLOCK.

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (to Ted)
           What the hell are you doing?!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, let him go!

                        TED
                 (out of breath)
           I'm trying...tell him to...calm down.

The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.

                        MARY'S DAD (cont'd)
                 (to Ted)
           Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you
           doing?!

                        TED
           I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a
           baseball.

                        MARY'S MOM
           What baseball? Where's a baseball?

Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.

                        TED
           There was a ball I had a honest.

As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie
is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to
the couch.

                        MARY (to Ted)
           I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a
           thing about his ears.

                        TED
           Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

                        MARY
           Are you all right?

                        TED
           Oh yeah.

                        MARY'S MOM
                 (to Mary)
           Honey, now you're all wrinkled.

Mary looks down and frowns.

                        MARY
           Ted, will you just give me one more minute?
           I have to iron this thing.

Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back
up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.

Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

                        TED
                 (to Mary's Dad)
           May I use your bathroom?

INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As he
TAKES A LEAK he glances out the window to his left.

TED'S POV - two LOVEBIRDS are perched on a branch.

Ted smiles...

...at the SOUND of these beautiful tweeties singing their love
song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and
suddenly they fly away and we...

SNAP FOCUS 
...to reveal Mary in the bedroom window DIRECTLY BEHIND WHERE THE
BIRDS WERE, in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother
glances Ted's way and MAKES EYE-CONTACT with what she can only
presume to be a leering Peeping Tom.

ON TED...

...he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom,
HORRIFIED.

PANICKING NOW, he hastily zips up his fly and

                        TED

Mary REACTS to this.

           One guess.

           How the hell'd you get the beans all the
           way up top like that?

                        TED
           I don't know. It's not like it was a well
           thought-out plan.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming
           through there.

                        MARY'S DAD
           I'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek
           was about, pumpkin.

                        MARY'S MOM
           I'm going to get some Bactine.

           No, please!

Suddenly a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head in the bathroom window.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Ho there.

                        TED

           Oh God.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Everything okay here? Neighbors said they
           heard a lady scream.

                        MARY'S DAD
           You're looking at him. C'mere and take a
           look at this beauty.

                        TED
           No, that's really unneces--

But the Officer's already climbing in the window. Once inside, he
turns his flashlight on Ted and WHISTLES.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Now I've seen it all. What the hell were
           you thinking?

                        TED

Mary's parents nod.

           the way to the top?

                        MARY'S DAD
           Let's just say the kid's limber.

The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Well, there's only one thing to do.

                        TED
           No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my
           shirttail out and work on it in the
           morning.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.

Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.

INT. PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE - PRESENT DAY

Ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch.

                        TED
           ...Anyway, school ended a few days later
           and that July her father got transferred to
           Florida.

The CAMERA PANS up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.
Ted has been telling all this to no one.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It took me half the summer to pay off all
           those bets.
                 (sighs)
           I never did see Mary again. That was about
           twelve years ago.

Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar.)

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Uh-huh. Interesting.

The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,
then tosses it aside.

                        TED
           Anyway, it's not something you exactly
           forget about, but I guess I must've blocked
           it out of my head. Then about a week ago
           I'm driving on the highway and I got to
           thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't
           breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow
           of traffic anymore I felt like I was
           going to die. I pulled into a rest area,
           parked the car, and just started shaking.

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           You know...rest areas are homosexual
           hang-outs.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses
           of the nineties for some gay men.

Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.

Ted and his friend DOM are blasting a couple buckets.

                        DOM
           Gay? He said you were gay?

                        TED
           He implied it.

                        DOM
           Well you're a writer, and a lot of
           writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.

                        TED
           Yeah, but he was successful.

                        DOM
           Let me ask you this: When you smoke a
           cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

Ted appears to think about this.

                        TED
           Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

                        DOM
           I'm going to fix you up with my new
           assistant.

                        TED
           What's he like?

Dom LAUGHS, then watches as Ted hits a ball.

                        DOM
           You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.
                 (beat)
           You're going to like this one--she's half

           Good-looking?

                        DOM
           I just told you, she's half Asian. half
           American. They're all good looking. You
           could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and
           they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's
           a foolproof combo.

Ted thinks about it.

                        TED
           What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm
           in a slump.
                 (SIGHS)
           Lately I've been feeling like...well...like
           a loser.

                        DOM
           Loser? You?

Ted shrugs.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break. Remember five years ago,
           when your kidneys failed? If you were a
           loser would they have been able to find a
           donor with an exact tissue match? What are
           the odds of that, one in a million?

                        TED
           Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got
           killed in an explosion?

                        DOM
           I never said that. I'm saying your lucky
           those kids found his kidneys.
                 (beat)
           Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a
           shit about you.

Ted gives him a look.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty
           guy. You got a fucking guardian angel, man.

Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RINGS.

                        TED

Whoever it is HANGS UP. Without reacting, Ted closes the phone and
puts it back in his pocket.

EXT. DOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps.
We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball
hoop, dolls, etc.

DOM'S WIFE comes out and hands them each a cigar.

           I thought you guys might like these with
           your beers.

She goes back inside.

           See, that's what I want. I don't need these
           bimbettes you got me chasing. I want what
           you have. A family....Someone to...you
           know...love.

These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a
little embarrassed.

           definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve
           years.

           Whatever happened to Mary?

                        TED
           I told you, her family moved to Miami.

           I don't know.

           Why not?

                        TED
           Because I guarantee she's married and has a
           couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay
           single.

                        DOM
           What if you're wrong? You just said she's
           the only girl you ever loved, what have you

           you gave up?

                        TED
           I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

           You're kidding? What did they say?

                        TED
           They told me they don't help out stalkers.
                 (beat)
           Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long
           time.

                        DOM
           I got it--you hire a private eye, fly him
           out there, he follows her around a couple
           days, she'll never know a thing.

Ted considers this.

                        TED
           No. No fucking way. That's too creepy.

Dom thinks a moment, then SNAPS his fingers.

           Wait a second. There's a guy named Healy in
           my office who might be able to help you
           out. He's a claims investigator and he goes
           to Miami every couple weeks.

           ended up on my desk.

           Seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or

           him transferred down to Providence.

                        TED
           You don't buy what?

Suddenly Healy is in his face.

                        HEALY
           Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from
           the hip. Now I want you to level with me:
           Did you knock this skirt up?

                        TED
                 (indignant)
           No.

                        HEALY
           She's blackmailing you, right?

                        TED
                 (more indignant)
           No.

                        HEALY
           You want her dead, don't you?

                        TED
           You can't be serious.

                        HEALY
           Do you really expect me to believe this is
           a straight stalker case?

                        TED
           I'm not a stalker ! She's a friend of mine.

                        HEALY
           Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted
           number and you haven't heard squat from her
           in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted.
           You're a real piece of work.

                        TED
                 (stands)
           Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the
           whole thing.

                        HEALY
           I get one hundred a day plus expenses.

                        TED
                 (LAUGHS at Healy's nerve)
           You get fifty a day, period. It's a
           business trip, they'll pay for your
           expenses.

Healy thinks about it. 

                        HEALY
           Okay, Ted, I'll do it. But if this chick
           turns up with a toe tag, I'm rolling over
           on you.

                                                       CUT TO:

ESTABLISHING SHOT - of Miami Beach

EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - DAY

Healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a RACK OF
BEERS. Suddenly a '89 Chrysler Lebaron convertible with a GREAT
DANE in the back SCREECHES to a halt in front of him. The driver,
SULLY, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.

                        SULLY
           Healy you dog!

                        HEALY
                 (checking out car)
           Fucking Sully! Look at you!

                        SULLY
                 (Boston accent)
           You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAY

The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy a
packet.

                        SULLY
           Here's the info you asked for.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

                        SULLY
           You should thank me--that girl was not easy
           to find. What'd she scam you out of-some
           insurance dough?

                        HEALY
           Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track
           down his high school girlfriend.

                        SULLY
           Stalker, huh?

                        HEALY
           Big time.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - DAY

This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South
Beach. Healy puts his bags down and looks around.

                        HEALY
           Very nice.

                        SULLY
           I'm doing okay.
                 (checks watch)
           I gotta get ready for work.

Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment.

                        HEALY
           Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels?
           Looks like you really cleaned up your act.

                        SULLY (O.S.)
           What can I tell you? It's a healthier
           lifestyle down here, and it's easier to
           succeed when your head's clear. Those guys
           I worked with back in Boston, they were a
           bad influence.

                        HEALY
           Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go
           grab a couple drinks.

                        SULLY (O.S.)
           Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.

                        HEALY
           Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?

Suddenly a huge Boa Constrictor slithers up on Healy's lap.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           What the...?!

Sully comes back in the room wearing a police uniform.

                        SULLY
           Take it easy, that's Bill.

                        HEALY
           Tell Bill to get the fuck off!

                        SULLY
                 (smiling)
           Relax, he just ate.

Healy just stares at his friend.

                        SULLY (cont'd)
                 (proudly)
           Nineteen months I been sober.

                        HEALY
           What are you talking about? You were never
           an alky, you were a cokehead.

                        SULLY
           Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta
           quit the booze, too.

                        HEALY
           Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm
           proud of you.

Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here, just have one of these then.

                        SULLY
           Healy, what I just tell you?

                        HEALY
           This is a light beer. You can't have a
           light beer?

                        SULLY
           No I can't.

Healy stares at him, baffled.

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ
           sakes.
                 (holds up beer)
           Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

Sully stares at the beer, weakening.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm worried about you, man. You better
           learn to have a pop once in a while or
           you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're
           being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

                        SULLY
           Am I?

                        HEALY
           Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to
           hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You
           gotta learn how to bend a little or believe
           me...you're gonna break.

Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then
sips.

                        SULLY
           Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't
           even taste good to me anymore.

                        HEALY
           Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are
           you, spotting?

Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN

Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours,
food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type
HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE
attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.

Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted
awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the
binoculars toward...

HEALY'S POV - MARY'S APARTMENT ACROSS THE STREET

Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The
music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and
shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over
her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed,
wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she
still looks well cast.

CLOSE UP - ON HEALY - he's become extremely interested in his
work. As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to
do--he speaks into a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER:

                        HEALY
                 (into recorder)
           Okay, Ted, I found your Mary. Her current
           address, two-niner-eight Euclid Avenue,
           Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children
           and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass,
           affirmative.

INT. MARY'S APT. - DAY

Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, MAGDA,
sitting on the couch LISTENING to a stack of RADIO SCANNERS.

                        MARY
           Have you been up all night again?

                        MAGDA
           Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,
           Neighborhood Watch is.

                        MARY
           Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call
           listening in on stranger's phone
           conversations?

                        MAGDA
           These ain't strangers, they're neighbors.
           This only picks up signals in a half-mile
           radius.

                        MARY
           Meaning?

                        MAGDA
           Meaning these are the people you live
           amongst, you got a right to know if they're
           creeps. For instance, did you know there's
           a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

                        MARY
                 (feigning shock)
           You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta
           move.

                        MAGDA 
           I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew
           something was up because Puffy used to bark
           like hell whenever he saw him and you know
           Puffy only barks at bad people.

Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.

                        MARY
           Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

                        MAGDA
           That's because there's a lot of bad people
           out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you
           about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was
           a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out
           for yourself, didn't you?

                        MARY
           Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,
           huh.

Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.

                                                       CUT TO:

MUSIC MONTAGE - as Healy follows Mary around town.

EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING

Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world. There is
a HOMELESS MAN sitting on the sidewalk. Mary flips him an apple,
then jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - MORNING

Mary is at the range HITTING a couple buckets of balls.

ON HEALY - watching from the parking lot.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.

EXT. MACDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU WINDOW - MORNING

Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the SPORTS PAGE. Finally
the window opens and she is handed a HUGE BAG OF FOOD.

PAN TO Healy watching from his car.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm
           guessing she's either got a bowel disorder
           or we've got a hurler on our hands.

EXT. SPECIAL ED. CENTER - MORNING

Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out
front with a SPECIAL ED TEACHER while several other
MENTALLY-DISABLED PATIENTS entertain themselves.

Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins.

                        MARY
           Get in line. One at a time.

A fat patient, GARY, approaches.

                        GARY
           Can I have two, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, you can have two halves, just like
           everyone else.

                        GARY
           Thanks.

Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then
bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.

                        FREDDIE
           Will you marry me, Mary?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about
           Dolores?

Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.

                        FREDDIE
           Would you marry us both, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,
           wouldn't it?

Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be
inconspicuous.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Wow, this is weird. There was somebody who
           looked just like you here a minute ago.

Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.

CLOSE ON Healy.

           Ixnay on the big appetite.
                 (beat)
           She's just got a big heart.

EXT. BEACH BAR - DAY

Neighborhood restaurant and bar. After-work crowd. Mary and her
friends, BRENDA, LISA, and JOANIE are sitting at a table under an
umbrella. Lisa reads from the PERSONALS COLUMN in South Beach
Magazine.

                        LISA
           Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp
           doctor to share candlelit dinners, long
           walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'

                        BRENDA
           What does this girl want, a corpse? You
           gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute
           with three pound cock and trust fund.'

                        JOANIE
           No, it should be 'a hockey player with
           great pecs.'

                        MARY
           Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those
           guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana
           hammock.

PAN TO the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their
conversation.

                        BRENDA (O.S.)
                 (to Mary)
           I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a
           washboard stomach like Brad Pitt?

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        MARY
           I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a
           bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy.
           You can have those pretty boys who hang out
           in a gym all day staring at their
           reflections.

ON HEALY 
                        HEALY
                 (quietly into mic)
           A girl after your own heart, Ted.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANIE
           I can live with those reflections.

                        MARY 
           I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.
           Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer
           and playing thirty-six holes and still has
           enough energy to take me and Warren out to
           a ballgame.

                        JOANIE
                 (sarcastic)
           Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going
           to find a guy like that.

                        MARY
           But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking
           about has got to be self-employed.

                        LISA
           You mean, like an architect or something?

                        MARY
           Architect, yeah.

BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.

                        MARY
           No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah,
           that's good, but it's the freedom I'm
           talking about. See, this guy has to have a
           job he could do anywhere. That way we could
           just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

                        LISA
           And where would you and your beer-bellied
           architect be leaving to?

                        MARY
           I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans
           Jazz Festival...maybe a couple months in
           Nepal.

                        JOANIE
           Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy
           halfway to Katmandu.

                        MARY
           What's that supposed to mean?

                        JOANIE
           It means you're too hard on guys.

                        MARY
           No I'm not.

                        JOANIE
           Oh come off it, Mare. What about
           what's-his-name...Steverino? You could've
           at least passed the baton on that one.

The girls LAUGH.

                        MARY
           Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for
           awhile.

                        JOANIE
           All right for awhile? The guy's
           good-looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

                        LISA
           At one point you were talking about
           marrying him. Come on, why'd you dump him?

Mary thinks about this.

                        MARY
           I don't know, it was complicated. He's in
           San Francisco, I'm in Miami.
                 (dodging question)
           Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.

                        JOANIE
           Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you
           said you were putting her up for a
           month--it's been a year and a half.

                        MARY
           Ah, she's okay.

                        LISA
           Mary, cut the crap, what really happened
           with Steve?

                        MARY
           Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.
                 (sighs)
           Warren.

                        JOANIE
           What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.

                        MARY
           I don't want someone who'll put up with
           him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the
           way I do. Do you know what he told my
           friend Tucker? He said he would've popped
           the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't
           in my life.
                 (beat)
           Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn
           lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

Everyone is touched by this. Then:

                        BRENDA
           Well, that's the last time I blow him
           behind your back.

As the girls LAUGH, we

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get
home. He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers
but doesn't speak.

                        HEALY
           Hello...? Sully...?
                 (beat)
           Sully, that you?

                        SULLY (V.O.)
                 (over phone)
           Who the fuck is it to you?

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over
           there?

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a
ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer
cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine
and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake
are in the doorway looking at him with concern.

                        SULLY
                 (into phone, sloshed)
           Fuckin' Patrick Healy, you think your shit
           don't stink. Well I got news for
           you--you're goddamn right it don't! How the
           hell are ya?!

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy looks at the phone, concerned.

                        HEALY
           Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know
           I'll have your car back in a couple hours,
           I'm still staking out this girl's
           apartment.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           You found my car?!

Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park. He slides down in
his seat.

ON MARY - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the
Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. She hands him
the bag.

                        HOMELESS MAN
           Thanks, Mary.

                        MARY
           You watch out for yourself, Herb.

As Mary bounds up the steps of her building, we

HOLD ON the Homeless Man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda
out of the bag.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio
scanner, listening intently.

                        MAGDA
           Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some
           cop's staking out this broad's apartment.

                        MARY
           No time, Magda, my show's starting.

BACK ON HEALY...

... he can hear the conversation through the SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT
pointed at Mary's place.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his
           partner's all lubed up.

                        HEALY
                 (quietly into phone)
           Call you back.

                        SULLY
                 (over phone)
           God, I miss ya, ya fuck-

Healy hangs up abruptly.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                        MAGDA
           Ah, Christ, I lost 'em.

Mary runs into her bedroom, shuts the door and flips on the tube
just as ESPN Sportscenter's OPENING THEME SONG is playing.
Relieved, Mary lays back on her bed and starts watching.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mary is now watching Andy Griffith while SMOKING A JOINT and
GIGGLING away in bed.

ON HEALY - he's sitting in his car, GIGGLING, too.

                        HEALY
           Fucking Barney...he never learns...

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

As the show's end credits start to WHISTLE AWAY, Mary stands and
starts to UNDRESS for bed.

BACK ON HEALY - he sits up, very interested now.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Here we go, Teddo. Here comes the money
           shot.

Healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger,
MORE POWERFUL PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - we're CLOSE ON the wrinkliest,
saggiest, droopiest set of milkbags on the planet.

ON HEALY - he cringes.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oooof. First chink in the armor, Teddy
           Boy....

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - He moves his view up from the tits to
reveal...MAGDA UNDRESSING for bed.

ON HEALY - He flinches, sickened by his mistake, then
repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - moving over to the next window we see...
Mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t-shirt.

ON HEALY - as he starts to drool.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oh sweet Jesus

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. PROVIDENCE - THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling Healy
approaches.

                        HEALY
           I've got some very, very good news for you,
           my friend.

                        TED
           Really?
                 (perking up)
           Very, very?

Healy sits down and motions for a beer.

                        HEALY
           I think your life's about to change.

                        TED
           So you found Mary?

                        HEALY
           Right there in Liberty City. And you were
           right, she's really something.

                        TED
                 (smiles)
           So she hasn't changed?

                        HEALY
           That I couldn't. say. Let me ask you
           something: Was she a little big-boned
           in high school?

                        TED
           No, not at all.

                        HEALY
           Well she must've packed on a few pounds
           over the years.

This doesn't dampen Ted's enthusiasm.

                        TED
           Mary's a little chubby, huh?

                        HEALY
           I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
           Not bad.

Ted's smile starts to fade.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,
           you're going to put on a few pounds.

                        TED
           So she's married?

                        HEALY
           Nope. Never been.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        HEALY
           Four kids, three different guys.

                        TED
           Three different guys?

                        HEALY
           Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two
           whites, and a midget.

                        TED
           Oh my.

                        HEALY
           Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to
           keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

                        TED
           She's in a wheelchair?!

Ted looks completely drained.

                        HEALY
           Don't look so shocked, it's been a long
           time. I bet you've changed a lot over the
           last twelve years, haven't you?

                        TED
                 (shrugs)
           It's just that...Mary. I wouldn't have
           thought...

                        HEALY
           Anyway, the good news is I have all the
           information you need. Got it from her
           bookie--nice guy. You should definitely
           call her, Ted. I mean she's a real
           sparkplug, that one. She seems determined
           to get those rugrats off welfare and with
           your help I'll bet she does it.

Ted stands and starts moping away.

                        TED
           Thanks, Healy. Good work.

                        HEALY
           Ted? Don't you want the name of the
           housing project?

                        TED
           Uh, that's okay.

                        HEALY
           You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to
           hear from you before her mastectomy!

As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in
bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next
door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he
flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a
few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and opens
it.

TED'S POV - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling
Mary.

As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.

INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

ON HEALY'S CUBICLE - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap out
of his cubicle when he spots Ted. He tries to duck back in but
Ted sees him. Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches.

                        TED
           What are you doing?

                        HEALY
           Oh, uh, I resigned.

Ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk.

                        TED
           Miami?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, this insurance business is too slow
           for me. I'm going to go down and try my
           hand at jai alai.

                        TED
           Jai alai?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at
           home in the fronton.

Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows. Healy is
having a hard time looking him in the eye. So he doesn't.

                        TED
           Look, uh, I've been thinking about
           everything you told me. 

                        HEALY
           Good good.

                        TED
           Well I think you're right, I should look 
           her up.

                        HEALY
           Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

                        TED
           But you said she was a sparkplug...?

                        HEALY
           I said buttplug. She's heinous.

Ted SIGHS and follows Healy out the front door.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

They walk across the lot toward Healy's car.

                        TED
           All the same, I still want to call her. I
           know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot
           of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,
           maybe I can help her out.
                 (sighs)
           The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a
           wheelchair for Godsakes.

                        HEALY
           It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

                        TED
           Oh. I thought
                 (beat)
           That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't
           make any sense to you, but I just can't
           turn it off that fast. I still feel
           something for her.

Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.

                        HEALY
           Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number
           for you just as soon as she gets back from
           Japan.

                        TED
           Japan? What's she doing in Japan?

                        HEALY
           You've heard of mail-order brides? Well
           they go that way, too.

Ted is devastated. 

                        TED
           Mary's a mail-order bride?

                        HEALY
           Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget,
           it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the
           pound there. Sort of like tuna.

Off Ted's look, we

EXT. THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted and Dom are having a beer and a dog.

                        TED
           That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never
           procrastinate about anything again. Life is
           too fucking short. 

                        DOM
           Hey, look on the bright side--

                        TED
                 (interrupting)
           What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?

                        DOM
           Well...at least now you know.

                        TED
           I think it was better when I didn't. It was
           kind of inspiring to know there was someone
           so pure in the world.

As Ted dwells on this, Dom bursts out LAUGHING.

                        TED
           What's so funny?

                        DOM
           I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking
           this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're
           liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here
           you've been in therapy thinking you blew it
           with the greatest girl ever, and it turns
           out that getting your dick stuck in your
           zipper was the best thing that ever
           happened to you! 

Ted flinches at this.

                        TED
           Wait a second, I never told you that.

                        DOM
           Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. 

Ted thinks it over.

                        TED
           Maybe you're right. I should look on the
           bright side. I mean, I've still got my
           health...
                 (checks watch)
           I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six
           a.m. to move my boss's brother into his
           apartment.

                        DOM
           What? On your day off? Do you even know
           the guy?

                        TED
           Never met him.

                        DOM
           Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn
           novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.

                        TED
           Amen to that.

EXT. MIAMI - DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls
jauntily to...

A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S 
Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the ball
and it dribbles about ten yards.

                        HEALY
           Hit a house! Bite bite!
                 (to Mary)
           Haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about
fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,
and

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Hey, can you give me some tips here?

She cracks her shot long and straight.

                        MARY
           Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.

                        HEALY (cont'd) 
           I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?

                        MARY
                 (annoyed)
           No thanks.

Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.

                        HEALY
           Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar?
           All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.

                        MARY
                 (interested)
           Nepal? Have you been?

                        HEALY
           Not in months. I don't even know why I
           bought the damn place.

                        MARY
           You own a home there?

                        HEALY
           Well...it's just a condo really. Right
           outside Katmandu.

                        MARY
           Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to
           go. Is it true the mountains are so tall
           you can't see the tops?

                        HEALY
           Not 'til you get about three hundred yards
           from the summit. That's been my experience
           anyway.

She looks impressed. Healy looks at his watch. 

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You know, I should just get going. I'll
           work on my game next week.

He flips her a coin.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.

                        MARY
                 (smiles)
           Thanks.

Healy starts to walk off. Mary doesn't know what to do. Will she
ever see this guy again?

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (CALLS after him)
           It was nice meeting you!

Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand and
gives her a little wave.

Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's
Honda Civic.

He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary
coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door
and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses her
golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. A
second chance.

                        MARY
           Well, it was nice meeting you, again.

                        HEALY
           Same here again.

                        MARY
           By the way, what's your name?

                        HEALY
           Pat Healy.

There's an uncomfortable pause...Why doesn't this guy ask the
usual questions?

                        MARY
           Don't you want to know my name?

                        HEALY
           I already know it, Mary.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           How'd you know that?

                        HEALY
           It's right there on your golf bag.

Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,
rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to
help Healy pick them up.

                        MARY
           What are you doing with all these
           blueprints?

                        HEALY
           Some buildings I'm working on.

                        MARY
           Are you...an architect?

                        HEALY
           Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

Mary stares at him, mouth agape.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call
           me an architect--it's just a job really, a
           way to keep me moving. My real passion is
           my hobby.

                        MARY
           What's that?

                        HEALY
           I work with retards.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           I beg your pardon?

                 (put off)
           Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

                        HEALY
           The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me
           who I can and can't work with.

                        MARY
           No, I mean

                        HEALY
           --There's this one kid, we call him Mongo
           on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out
           of his cage once and--

                        MARY
           --He's in a cage?! 

                        HEALY
           Well it's more of an enclosure really.

                        MARY
           They keep him confined? That's bullshit!

                        HEALY
           That's what I said, so I went out and got
           him a leash you know, one of those
           clothesline runners for the backyard. He's
           got plenty of room out there to dig. The
           kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him
           to ball games, movies--you know, happy
           stuff.

                        MARY
           That sounds like fun.

                        HEALY
           Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven
           for me.
                 (getting emotional)
           Those goofy bastards are just about the
           best thing I have in this crazy old world.
                 (checks watch)
           Ooh, hey, I gotta run.

                        MARY
                 (won back over)
           Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go
           have dinner sometime.

Healy smiles at this and we

A profusely sweating Ted has a DRESSER ON HIS BACK and EEKS his
way toward the front door as his BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER catches
up to him IN A WHEELCHAIR. (The man is a quadriplegic who needs to
use a MOUTHPIECE to operate his chair.)

           S'matter with you? You look like you're
           fading.

           Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know
           what heavy feels like, you insensitive
           prick.

           Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a
           cup of coffee.

The Boss's Disabled Brother bites into the mouthpiece and ZIPS
AWAY up the sidewalk. Ted takes a step. Rests. A step. Rests.

                        ASSERTIVE WOMAN'S VOICE
           Hey you!

Ted glances back toward the street to see a T.V. NEWS REPORTER
from the CHANNEL 7 I-TEAM rushing toward him with a NEWS CREW on
her heels.

Ted is splayed out on a table in obvious pain while DR. LALONDE,
an old high school pal, palpates his spine.

           said, too. Out getting coffee...supposed to

Ted turns and GLARES at him.

           I'm just saying...They sure made you look

Ted SIGHS. A couple big CRACKS of the neck.

Ted sits up.

                        MARY (V.O.)

           an old lady go for a young kid?

Mary smiles at this.

                        MARY
           The point is, love isn't about money or
           social standing or age, it's about
           connecting with someone, having things in
           common kindred spirits.

Healy enters the building.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Healy tiptoes up to Mary's apartment door. He peeks through the
mail slot.

HEALY'S POV - Puffy is staring at him and GROWLING.

Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a VALIUM and a DOGGY TREAT.
Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,
then thinks what the hell and SHOVES IN ANOTHER ONE.

Puffy GROWLS LOUDER. Healy pops the treat through the mail slot
and listens as the dog DEVOURS IT. Healy looks at his watch, then
sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick
in.

Healy is sitting on Mary's couch with Puffy spread-eagled
upside-down on his lap, KNOCKED OUT COLD. Mary and Magda look on
in amazement.

           Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum-tum

           Wow, I've never seen him like this. He
           doesn't usually like guys.

           You mean he doesn't like bad guys.

           aren't ya?

                        HEALY
           Truth is I usually get along better with
           animals than with people. In Nepal the
           villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee', which
           means 'man who is loved by many animals...
                 (babbling)
           ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'

Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.

           Would you like a glass of tea or something?

                        HEALY
           You got a brew?

           cheese and crackers...?

                        MAGDA
           Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the
MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE
TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch
to time the rate.

                 (CALLING out)
           Great.

He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes into
action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE CPR.
One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

                        MAGDA (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           No, thanks.
                 (panicking)
           Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

INT. MARY'S KITCHEN - SAME

Magda and Mary are on their way out the door when they stop.

                        MAGDA
           Bundt cake?

                        MARY
                 (shrugs)
           Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can
           find some cookies.

As Magda starts to go through the cupboards...

INT. MARY'S FAMILY ROOM - SAME

A panicked Healy is giving the little mutt MOUTH-TO-MOUTH now.
Then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth....

                        HEALY
                 (quietly, desperately, to Puffy)
           Come on, man, stay away from the light!

Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,
with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and
quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.

Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A
DEFIBRILLATOR on the little pooch's chest.

ZZZZZTTTTTT - the dog BOUNCES a couple feet off the couch as
SPARKS FLY.

Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with
the LIVE WIRES.

ZZZZZTTTTT - Still nothing. Healy gets to his feet and peeks
into the kitchen. When he turns his back, we see PUFFY IGNITE IN
FLAMES.

When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs a
vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.

With this, Puffy flinches and comes to, GASPING FOR AIR!

                        MAGDA
           All I had was some Funny Bones--how does
           that sound, honey?

Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as
Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.

                        HEALY
                 (petting dog)
           Fine. Fine.

                        MARY
           Here you go.
                 (sniffs)
           What's that smell?

Mary hands Healy his vodka and as he downs it, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI MUSEUM - NIGHT

Healy looks slightly disoriented as Mary leads the way into the
courtyard area by the main building.

                        HEALY
           The museum? I thought we were going out to
           dinner?

                        MARY
           We will, but first I have a surprise.

                        HEALY
           A surprise?

                        MARY
           The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker
           is going to be here. He's an architect,
           too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

CLOSE ON HEALY'S FACE as he starts to panic.

INT. ARCHITECTURE EXHIBIT

Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area. Mary scans the room
for her friend. Healy's face is ashen.

                        MARY
           I know he's around here someplace.

                        HEALY
                 (chipper)
           What say we get outta here and go crush a
           bucket?

                        MARY
           We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't
           this stuff great?

Mary points to an architectural model.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Is this one art deco or art nouveau?

                        HEALY
           Deco.

                        MARY
           Would you call that a portico or a
           vestibule?

                        HEALY
           That...? Vestibule.

                        MARY
           How about--?

                        HEALY
           When you look at architecture, try not to
           concern yourself with the pieces--look at
           the building in its totalitarianism.

Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible
sixshooters at her.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Stone crab time! Come on, let's get outta
           here, goofy.

He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.

                        MARY
           Tucker!

Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a
distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog
that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.

                        TUCKER
                 (still hugging)
           Come on, like you mean it.

Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:

                        MARY
           Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy.
           Healy and Tucker shake hands.

                        TUCKER
           Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

                        HEALY
           Same here.

                        MARY
           Pat's an architect, too.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?

                        HEALY
                 (keeping cool)
           Mainly I work out of Boston. 

                        TUCKER
           Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up
           there?

                        HEALY
           Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

                        TUCKER
           Harvard?

                        HEALY
           You bet.

                        TUCKER
                 (pleased)
           Did you study under Kim Greene?

                        HEALY 
           Among others.

                        TUCKER
           Kim and I are close friends!

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.

                        TUCKER
           You mean him.

BEAT.

                        HEALY
           Well...that's debatable.

Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in
doubt.

                        TUCKER
           Really? But he's been married for twenty
           years--they've got six kids.

                        HEALY
           Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Tucker can hardly believe his ears.

                        MARY
           Pat does projects all over the world.

                        TUCKER
                 (impressed)
           Where would I have seen your work?

                        HEALY
           Have you been to
                 (thinking hard)
           Let's see--Santiago, Chile?

                        TUCKER
           Absolutely! I was there twice last year.
           Which building is yours?

                        HEALY
           Do you know the...soccer stadium?

                        TUCKER
           Did you build the Estadio Olympico?

                        HEALY
           No...just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

                        TUCKER
           I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What
           style?

                        HEALY
           Uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big
           vestibule. Check it out next time you're up
           there.

Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

                        TUCKER
           You know, I really should take your card.

                        HEALY
                 (noticing something)
           Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a
           minute, Tucker?

Healy drags Mary across the room toward a MAN who's looking at an
exhibit.

                        HEALY
                 (to Man)
           Dooby, you old sheep-fucker! How the hell
           are ya?

                        MAN
           My name's Mel.

                        HEALY
           Oh, sorry. Anyone ever tell you you look
           just like Jim Dubois?

                        MAN
           The sheepfucker?

Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A two-door Toyota Tercel flies by the camera.

INT. TOYOTA TERCEL

A determined Ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car.
He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a HITCHHIKER in the seat
beside him. The Hitchhiker sits with a LARGE RED DUFFEL BAG
between his legs.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Thanks for picking me up. 

                        TED
           No prob, I could use the company. I've been
           on the road going on fifteen hours
           straight.

                        HITCHHIKER
           I know how you feel--I been standing in the
           same spot for the last five hours. You know
           it's against the law to pick up a
           hitchhiker in this state.

                        TED
           That must make it tough.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of
           salesman or something?

                        TED
           Nah. I'm...I'm nothing.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Oh. Well I am.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        HITCHHIKER
           A salesman--that's what I am. I mean, I'm
           gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own
           company--video sales--just as soon as I get
           enough seed money.

                        TED
           'That right? Good for you.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a
           home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute
           Abs?

                        TED
           The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on
           T.V.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Two million copies it sold last year. Two
           million, man. But not next year--my idea's
           gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:
                 (dramatic pause)
           Seven-Minute Abs.

BEAT.

                        TED
           I see where you're going.

                        HITCHHIKER
                 (big smile)
           Think about it. You walk into a video
           store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and
           right next to it you see Seven-Minute
           Abs--which one you gonna spring for?

                        TED
           I'd go with the seven.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll
           get every bit as good a work-out.

                        TED
           How do you guarantee that?

                        HITCHHIKER
           Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't
           happy we'll send you the extra minute.'

                        TED
           Huh. That sounds great.
                 (beat)
           Unless someone else comes out with
           Six-Minute Abs.

Ted CHUCKLES, but the Hitchhiker just GLARES at him, unamused.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (unaware)
           I'm gonna pull over. I gotta take a leak.

EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

The Toyota Tercel pulls in and parks. Ted gets out and walks into
the bushes to whiz.

ON TED - as he steps into the dark brush UNZIPPING his fly he
TRIPS over something and FALLS TO THE GROUND.

                        TED
           What the--?

Suddenly WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH--several huge SPOTLIGHTS
illuminate the area revealing

TWO DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEN scurrying to pull their pants up all
around him.

                        POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
           THIS IS A RAID!

           Wait a second, it's not what you think.

A GUY with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon.

                        PANTS AT ANKLES GUY
           That's right! I-I-I was just pissing!

Ted glares at him.

                        TED
           No! I was pissing!

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in
           the truck.

As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we

PAN TO the Hitchhiker sitting in the Toyota watching the raid
unfold.

The Hitchhiker is clearly PANICKY at the sight of all the cops.

Quietly he OPENS THE CAR DOOR, ducks down, and then SPRINTS AWAY
INTO THE WOODS UNSEEN, LEAVING HIS BIG RED BAG BEHIND.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - NIGHT

Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date. Healy is
eating a big, wild cone of COTTON CANDY and drinking a beer.

                        HEALY
           That grandmother of yours--she's really
           something.

                        MARY
           Magda? She's not my grandmother--actually
           she rents the apartment right next to mine.
           Her husband passed away a couple years ago
           so she doesn't like to be alone.

                        HEALY
           And it doesn't cramp your style?

                    MARY
               Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

                        HEALY
           Lint?

                        MARY
           Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running
           around on the rug all day--just makes for a
           lot of lint. Look at this...

Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a BIG CLUMP OF COTTON CANDY
STICKING OUT OF HER BELLY-BUTTON.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           See? That's just one day.

Healy CRACKS UP and then gazes at her. What a babe.

                        HEALY
           You know, sometimes I wish I could be like
           Magda and not go home. I'd like to just
           bounce around for awhile, do a little
           traveling...

                        MARY
           Why bounce when you have your own condo in
           Nepal to go to?

It's clear Healy forgot about that one.

                        HEALY
           Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new
           place, quit the architect game, slow things
           down, read more books, see more movies...

                        MARY
           You're a movie buff?

                        HEALY
           Try to be. It's tough going with the crap
           they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the
           best they've got to offer I say thanks but
           no thanks.

                        MARY
           Have you seen it?

                        HEALY
           No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr
           hated it.

                        MARY
           A fucking moron.

                        HEALY
           Huh. I guess I just wish they made them
           like they used to. You know, something like
           The Heartbreak Kid...or Harold and
           Maude.

Mary can't believe her ears.

                        MARY
           Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite
           movie.

                        HEALY
           Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know
           it's corny, but I do love it.

                        MARY
           Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's
           the greatest--

                        HEALY
           --Love story of our time.

Mary smiles. Is this guy for real?

                        MARY
           Yeah.

                        HEALY
           Wow. I thought I was the only one.

They come to her apartment building and stop. It gets a little
awkward.

                        MARY
           So...

                        HEALY
           Yeah...I guess this is it, huh?

                        MARY
           I guess.

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll see ya.

Healy turns to go but stops.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Mary ah, forget it.

                        MARY
           What?

                        HEALY
           No, forget it, it was stupid.

                        MARY
           Come on, what were you going to say?

                        HEALY
           Nah, really, it was moronic.

She grabs him by the shirt playfully.

                        MARY
           Just say it.

Healy takes a deep breath.

                        HEALY
           Could I feel your bosoms before I go?

Mary just stares at him.

                        MARY (beat)
           Knock yourself out.

Healy reaches out and cups her breasts. He doesn't kiss her, she
doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. Then:

                        HEALY
           Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?

She smiles and as Healy walks away we

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

Ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room.

PULLBACK to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way
mirror by two detectives, FRANEK and CAVALLO.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Man, they never look like you'd expect.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           That's probably how he got the victim to
           drop his guard. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Where'd they find the body?

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           In a big red bag on the front passenger
           seat. All hacked up--fucking gruesome--a
           real psycho, this one.

The Detectives ENTER the room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him.

                        TED
                 (agitated)
           I'm telling you, I did not solicit sex! I
           was just stopping to go the bathroom, next
           thing I know I tripped over something--well
           someone--and, POOF, there's cops and
           lights and--

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you.
                 (beat)
           The problem is we found your friend in
           the car.

As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him. Finally
Ted thinks he gets it.

                        TED
           Oh. The hitchhiker.
                 (CHUCKLES)
           That's what this is all about.

Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Isn't that just my luck--I get caught for
           everything.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           So you admit it?

                        TED
           Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games
           with you. I could give you a song and dance
           but what's the point? I did it and we all
           know it.
                 (laughs)
           The hitcher himself told me it's
           illegal The irony.

The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           Well, uh, can you tell us his name?

                        TED
           Jeez, I didn't catch it.

The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           So he was a stranger? It was totally
           random?

                        TED
                 (confused)
           He was the first hitcher I saw, what can I
           tell you? Now cut to the chase, how much
           trouble am I in? 

The Detectives look at one another. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           First tell us why you did it.

                        TED
           Why I did it?
                 (scoffs)
           I don't know. Boredom? I thought I was
           doing the guy a favor.

The Detectives look at each other.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted?
           How many we talking?

                        TED
           Hitchhikers? I don't know--fifty...a
           hundred maybe--Who keeps track?

Finally Detective Cavallo EXPLODES across the table and starts
WAILING on a shocked Ted.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           You sonofabitch! You're gonna fry!!!!

EXT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic. She parks out front and enters
the building.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL - Healy is parked in his car.
His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary walks into the office and sees a MEDICAL ASSISTANT standing
near the coffee maker.

                        MARY
           Mornin', Jane.

                        MEDICAL ASSISTANT #1
           Good morning, Doctor. Your friend Tucker's
           in your office to see you. 

Mary nods and heads toward her office. 

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk.
(SHOT FROM behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head.)

                        TUCKER
           What's up, Doc?

                        MARY
           Tucker, you look different some how. Did
           you do something with your hair?

MARY'S POV - Tucker's got two TONGUE DEPRESSORS under his upper
lip making him look like a walrus.

                        TUCKER
           The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.

ON MARY - smiles.

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, they look great.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office.

                        TUCKER (V.O.)
           You don't think they're too big?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           No no, the bigger the better.
                 (beat)
           But I must say, they could be a little
           brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful
           of pearly whites.

Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror. Not exactly pearly.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. He
stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a
kiss on the cheek.

                        TUCKER
           You ever been laid in this office?

Mary pushes past him.

                        MARY
           Behave yourself, Tucker.
                 (smiles)
           Come on, what are you doing here?

She sits in her chair and leans against her desk.

                        TUCKER
           I wanted to talk to you about your friend
           Patrick.

EXT. HEALY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Healy almost flies out of his seat.

                        MARY (O.S.)
           He's a nice guy, isn't he?

                        TUCKER (O.S.)
           Well that's what I'm trying to figure
           out. How long have you known him?

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker has a look of concern.

                        MARY
           Not long at all, but I really like him.
                 (off Tucker's look)
           Okay, I know he's a little different,
           Tucker, but that's what I like about him.
           He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a
           dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always
           politically correct and he probably farts,
           too. And that's okay with me.

                        TUCKER
           That's what you've been looking for--a
           farter?

                        MARY
           I've been looking for a guy--not one of
           these South Beach pussies.

                        TUCKER
                 (SIGHS)
           Look, it's just that something about him
           struck me as odd last night. He gave me
           this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some
           friends back east. They don't know of any
           architect named Patrick Healy and he's not
           listed as a Harvard alumnus.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

Healy SLAMS his hand on the steering wheel.

                        HEALY
           Fuck!!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Huh...that's strange.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

                        TUCKER
           I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't
           think I'm being meddlesome. I just think
           you should be careful with this guy.

                        MARY
                 (concerned)
           No no no, Tucker, thank you.

                        TUCKER
           I mean let's face it, Mary, you're
           beautiful, you've got money, you trust
           people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of
           psychos out there.

                        MARY
                 (small smile)
           I appreciate you looking out for me.

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

CLOSE ON - Detective Franek as he SPEAKS, sheepishly. His
remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           On behalf of the entire South Carolina law
           enforcement community, I would like to
           offer our heartfelt apologies for any pain
           or temporary inconvenience we may have
           caused you, Mr. Peloquin.

REVERSE ANGLE - reveals that Ted is lying on his prison bed
being spooned by a 300-pound SLEEPING INMATE.

INT. PRISON HALLWAY

The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was
           apprehended not far from where you were
           arrested. He was identified as an escaped
           mental patient and subsequently confessed
           to the murder that you were being held for.
           Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on
           the bag.

                        TED
                 (fragile)
           So...I'm free to go?

Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           No harm, no foul?

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           I guess.

Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward
the door.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           By the way, there's somebody here to see
           you.

           I am?

                        DOM
           Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just
           about to cut your throat when you stopped
           to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe
           up your ass, man.

                        TED
           Yeah feels like it.

Ted grimaces and shifts in his seat.

           Told my wife I was going to a Promise

           Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't
           know where to mail his last paycheck so I
           sent my assistant by his mother's
           apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic
           mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten
           years.

           Don't you see?--Healy lied to us about
           everything! The landlord said when he got
           back from Miami he kept talking about
           falling for some doctor named Mary!

Ted is stunned.

           Huh? What? No...My Mary? Mary wouldn't go
           for him....would she?

Dom hands Ted a SLIP OF PAPER.

           His address in Miami. You know, when you
           think about it, we really don't know the
           first thing about this guy.

Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted.

           Would you hens quit ya cackling and let her
           do what she wants to do. Puffy liked him
           and Puffy's never wrong.

The girlfriends roll their eyes.

                        BRENDA
           Mary, the guy's full of shit.

                        MARY
           What if he's not? What if Tucker just made
           an honest mistake?

                        LISA
           What if he didn't?

It's clear that Mary is torn.

           I don't know how I can bail now, he's going
           to be here any minute.

                        JOANNIE

           So where the hell are you, Healy?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary
           girl I told you about.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           The sawbones?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Yep.

The girls all look at one another.

                        BRENDA
           We hit the motherlode.

                        MARY
           We shouldn't be listening to this.

                        LISA AND JOANNIE
           Shhh.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           She still think you're a fucking architect?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Oh yeah.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Dumbshit.

                        LISA
           Mr. Perfect, huh?

Mary starts to feel like a fool.

                        MARY
                 (edgy)
           Turn it up, Magda.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.
           I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           I don't know. I guess...it just seems that
           women today are more impressed by the
           mighty buck than by some schmo who spent
           the last seventeen years scraping by on
           Peace Corp wages.

The girls all seem moved by this.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy is parked out front, the phone in one hand, a SCRIPT in the
other, as he listens to Sully read the following words:

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you
           say, she's going to want to hear about
           the things you did. 

                        HEALY
                 (dismissing this)
           Ahh.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - SAME

A disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch in
his underwear READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. There's COKE on the
table, DOG SHIT on the floor, and FLIES everywhere.

In the B.G. we see the Great Dane SNIFFING at his empty bowl and
the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.

                        SULLY
                 (reading)
           Come on, you could tell her about the
           irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan, the
           orphan babies who cried in your arms in
           Romania...
                 (does a line of blow)
           ...the hope you gave Freddie the leper in
           Calcutta...

Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and STARTS TO
EAT IT.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANNIE
                 (welling up)
           I love this man.

Magda folds her arms and gloats.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

                        HEALY
           Look, I did all those things for myself.
           I'll be honest with you, I'm a selfish
           prick. I get a high from helping all of
           God's creatures. An honest to goodness
           high.

Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively
squashes it.

ON SULLY - he has the phone wedged between his cheek and
shoulder as he STRUGGLES with the dog to get the script.

Sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line.

                        SULLY
                 (winging it)
           That's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on
           the front line. Remember the, uh,
           malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that
           vicious strain of genital herpes?

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - they flinch at this.

ON HEALY - he stares at the phone, horrified.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Uh, sure. I cured a lot of nasty
           illnesses in third-world countries.

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - as they let out a sigh.

                        HEALY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my
           philanthropy as some form of
           currency...especially after what I did.
                 (SIGHS)
           I lied to this poor girl. Lied. man. She
           deserved better.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Hey, love will make you do fucked-up
           things.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           You said it, mister.
                 (choking up)
           I gotta go.

ON SULLY - as he HANGS UP the phone and does another line, we

PAN TO the Great Dane Hal as he looks around for something,
anything to eat. He SNIFFS at a sock, then a beer bottle, before
finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill. Bill
glances the dog's way nervously, SENSES TROUBLE, and wiggles his
way into another room. As Hal TAKES OFF after the snake, we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

Healy starts to knock on Mary's door, but, before he can, the door
suddenly swings open revealing a beaming Mary.

                        HEALY
                 (startled)
           Oh Mary. Look, there's something I have
           to tell you. I'm not

Before he can finish, Mary steps forward and their mouths meet in
a passionate KISS. 

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

MONTAGE OF MARY AND HEALY COURTING 
--As Mary watches, Healy plays TOUCH FOOTBALL with Warren and a
few of his friends. Healy catches a pass then, trying a little too
hard to impress Mary, he delivers a forearm shiver to his defender
and gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets into the
end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another
defender.

--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED
INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile and
she reacts uncertainly.

--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a
night on the town.

                        MARY
           All set.

                        HEALY
           You look great.
                 (beat)
           Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of
           these pants?

When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a
THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just
LAUGHS.

--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a
romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but
he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are
spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND
WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.

--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't
looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In
the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

A lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front
while Warren stands off to the side LISTENING TO A WALKMAN.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals a devastated Ted and Dom watching this
from Ted's car.

                        TED
           Fuck me.
                 (sighs)
           Let's go home.

                        DOM
           No! You've gone through way too much to
           back down now. Get over there and do
           something--I can't stand watching this.

BACK ON MARY AND HEALY as Healy starts OVER-DOING IT and Mary
has to break it off.

                        MARY
           Whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste?

Healy LAUGHS.

                        HEALY
           How's my stomach taste, she says.
                 (shakes head)
           Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab,
           Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like
           a dog.

                        MARY
           Forget it. It was...fun.

ON TED AND DOM 
Ted recognizes Warren.

                        TED
           Holy shit, there's Warren.

BACK ON MARY. HEALY, AND WARREN 
Suddenly we see Warren PERK UP at something.

                        WARREN
           Franks and beans!

ON TED AND DOM 
                        TED
           Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.

They both duck down in their seats.

BACK ON MARY. HEALY. AND WARREN 
                        WARREN
           Beans and franks.

                        MARY
           Give it a rest, War. You just ate.

                        HEALY
           Aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big
           appetite.
                 (to Warren)
           Am I right?

Healy winks at Mary.

                        WARREN
           Huh?

Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.

                        HEALY
           I said you've got a big app--

Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Urrggghh...

                        MARY
           Warren!

ON TED AND DOM - as they flinch.

                        DOM
           Attaboy!

BACK ON MARY et al - Healy holds his throat, clearly in pain.

                        MARY
           Are you okay?

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (raspy, to Mary)
           Not to worry. So...see you tonight,
           right? Right?

                        MARY
                 (cornered)
           Sure.

Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car and
drives off.

ON TED AND DOM 
Ted stares gazily.

                        DOM
           Well? What are you waiting for?

                        TED
           I don't know what to say.

                        DOM
           Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the
           schmuck out of the water.

                        TED
           Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on
           her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.
                 (stares at Mary)
           She's even more beautiful than I remember.

THEIR POV - Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment.

                        DOM
           Get over there, you pussy! She's leaving!

Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around
and sees Ted.

                        TED
           You asshole, what are you--
                 (CALLING OUT CHEERILY)
           Mary! Is that you?

                        MARY
                 (squinting)
           Who's that?

Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary.

                        TED
           It is you! It's me...Ted. From Rhode
           Island Ted.

Finally she recognizes him.

                        MARY
           Oh my God...Ted.
                 (big smile)
           What are you...? I can't believe this. I
           haven't seen you since-- 

                        TED
           Yup, that's right. Junior prom...kinda.

                        MARY
           And did everything--?

                        TED
           Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

Mary LAUGHS.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How are you doing, Warren?

                        WARREN
           Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?

                        TED
           I'm gonna take a rain check.

Mary is stunned.

                        MARY
           I can't believe he remembered you. He never
           remembers anybody.
                 (beat)
           You know I tried to call you for weeks
           after that.

                        TED
           Really? I never got a message.

                        MARY
           That's weird. I talked to your brother
           Jimmy five or six times.

Ted is devastated to hear this.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           By the way, how's he doing?

                        TED
           He's dead.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

                        TED
                 (bitter)
           No, it was a good thing.
                 (off her look)
           I mean, good in that it was very quick.

Ted pantomimes an explosion.

                        MARY
           Oh. So...what brings you down here?

                        TED
           Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of
           mine decided to...ah...you know...just
           ...drive down.

She stares at him.

                        MARY
           Well you look great. Are you married, do
           you have kids?

                        TED
           Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.
                 (smiles)
           God, I cannot believe I'm standing here
           with Mary Jenson.

                        MARY
           Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.

                        TED
                 (taken aback)
           Oh...are you...?

                        MARY
           Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.
                 (off his look)
           There was this guy back in college who was
           bothering me...got kind of ugly--a
           restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,
           when I got out of Princeton I changed my
           name as a precaution.

                        TED
           Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you
           say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up
           on old times?

BEAT.

                        MARY
           Didn't we just do that?

Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but
           the thing is I already have plans. How
           about tomorrow night?

                        TED
           Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve
           years.
                 (beat)
           Don't make me wait another day.

Mary seems touched by this.

                        MARY
           Tell me where you're staying. I'll pick you
           up at eight.

Ted finally smiles and we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT

A content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently
listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the
newspaper.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           I'm buying bananas tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Why?

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Back when I was your age I always used to
           make myself a big banana split after sex. I
           think you're gonna need one tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll
           probably need it before I will.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the
couch.

                        MAGDA
           Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap
           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an
           oyster shucker.

                        MARY
           So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to
           take you to the movies.

                        MAGDA
           Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're
           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to
           be.

                        MARY
           Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.

                        MAGDA
           Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this
           since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

BACK ON HEALY - he's reveling in it all.

                        MARY (V.O. )
           Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a
           guy today I hadn't seen since high school.

Healy loses the smile and sits up.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           An old flame?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest
           guys in the world.

Healy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.

ON MARY 
                        MARY (cont'd)
           He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major
           crush on him.

BACK ON HEALY as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He
grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.

                        HEALY
           No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that
           reminds me, I've got to call
           what's-his-face and cancel.

ON MARY 
                        MAGDA
           Do I sense a chill in the air?

Mary sits down.

                        MARY
           Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of
           my love life. I always pick guys on what I
           feel in here.
                 (pats heart)
           But with this Pat guy my head kept saying
           "Grow up, Mary. You have a lot in common
           with this one, you'll grow to feel
           something for him." But it never happened.

ON HEALY - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular
phone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS.
Panic-stricken. Then he answers it.

                        HEALY
                 (jovial voice)
           Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but
           I'm out rustling up some champagne and
           roses in preparation for the greatest
           birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are
           having a good day, too.

Healy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.

ON MARY - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.

                        MARY
           Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to
           say I'm...looking forward to tonight.

She hangs up.

                        MAGDA
           You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at
           night?

                        MARY
           I can't do it--I just found out it's his
           birthday.
                 (sighs)
           I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

ON HEALY - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then
he sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then he
hears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and the dog
YAPPING.

ON MARY - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's
Tucker, the architect.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           Tucker...come on in.

BACK ON HEALY pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller
coaster heading downhill.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Well look who's here.

BACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.

                        TUCKER
           There she is--I brought you a little
           thirst-quencher, Mag.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, you are sweet.

                        TUCKER
           No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk
           so you'll pass out and I can have my way
           with Mary.

Everyone LAUGHS.

                        MARY
           Can I pour you one?

                        TUCKER
           Thanks, but I've got to be going.
           Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social
           visit.

Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.

                        MARY
           What's up?

                        TUCKER
           Well...I've got a little more news about
           your friend Healy.

Mary seems relieved.

                        MARY
           I know what you're going to say, but he
           already told me everything. I know he's not
           an architect.

Tucker pulls out a piece of paper.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I think you'd better sit down.

                        MARY
           Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,
           but I'm really strapped for time here and--

                        TUCKER
           Mary, the man's a killer.

ON HEALY - he can't believe his ears.

BACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch.

                        MARY
                 (stunned)
           What...?

                        TUCKER
           I've got a friend in the Boston police
           department. He faxed me this this morning.
           I'll just give you the highlights.
                 (reading from rap sheet)
           After a short stint as a petty thief,
           Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery
           by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he
           committed his first murder--a pretty
           teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He
           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,
           despite a grim psychological profile, the
           state was forced to release him. In his
           mid-twenties and again in his early
           thirties he was suspected of homicides in
           the states of Utah and Washington.
           Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly
           decomposed that there wasn't enough
           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so
           forth and so on.

Mary looks like she's going to throw up.

ON HEALY - he listens intently, his face ashen.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Holy shit...

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Puffy, get over here.

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a
LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.

ON MARY 
                        MARY
           Magda!

                        MAGDA
           The little shit lied to me about that guy!

Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him.

                        MARY
                 (growing emotional)
           I can't believe this is happening. I'm
           supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, just calm down. It's going to be
           okay.

Tucker puts his arms around her.

                        MAGDA
           Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

Mary looks fondly at Tucker.

                        MARY
           Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in
           my life.

                        TUCKER
           Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give
           me a big head.
                 (smiles)
           The important thing, Doctor, is you've got
           to distance yourself as much as possible
           without pissing this psycho off.

                        MARY
           Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to
           do. I'll call him right now.

BACK ON HEALY - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He
stares at it, then picks it up.

                        HEALY
           Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and
           roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a
           message. BEEP.

                        MARY (V.O.)
                 (nervous)
           Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're
           not going to believe this--well, you'll
           believe it, there's no reason not to--but I
           just got beeped for emergency surgery.
           Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to
           bail on you.

As we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off down
the sidewalk.

ANGLE ACROSS THE STREET - on Healy, his steely gaze fixed on
Tucker.

                        HEALY
                 (under breath)
           You're gonna pay, fucker.

Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.

BACK ON TUCKER - He continues down the sidewalk, looking back
once or twice, apprehensive. He rounds a corner, then stops next
to an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker
DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into
traffic and follows.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously.

                        TED
           Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know
           if I'm ready for this, man.

                        DOM
           Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?

                        TED
                 (pats his back pocket)
           Got cash.

                        DOM
           Car clean? Plenty of gas?

                        TED
           Check.

                        DOM
           Mints?

                        TED
           Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

Dom nods, satisfied.

                        DOM
           Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just
           clean the pipes and it's a go.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        DOM
           You know, clean the pipes.

                        TED
           Pipes? What are you talking about?

                        DOM
           You jerk off before all big dates, right?
           Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

Ted just stares at him.

                        DOM (cont'd)
                 (incredulous)
           You don't jerk off before--?! Are you
           crazy?! That's like going out there with a
           loaded gun. No wonder you're nervous!

Ted considers this.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Think about it: After you've had sex with a
           girl and the two of you are laying in bed,
           are you nervous?

                        TED
           No.

Dom shrugs...Duh.

                        DOM
           Why's that?

                        TED
           I'm usually too tired to be.

Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound.

                        DOM
           Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby
           batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck
           with your head, that stuff will.

                        TED
                 (starting to believe)
           Huh.

                        DOM
           The most honest moment in a man's life is
           the five minutes after he's blown a load.
           That's a medical fact. And it's because
           you're no longer trying to get laid. You're
           actually thinking like a girl. They love
           that.

                        TED
           Jesus Christ you're right.

                        DOM
           You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go
           out with a loaded gun, you empty the
           barrels!

                        TED
                 (shakes his head)
           Holy shit, I've been going out with a
           loaded gun!

           People get hurt that way.

EXT. HOTEL - EVENING

Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary
gets out. He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks
past him.

INT. TED'S HOTEL BATHROOM - SAME

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra
ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We
see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes,
he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly
having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to
clean up.

But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his
hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the
ceiling, with no luck.

The Load IS MISSING!!!!

That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.
As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance
of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes to
answer it.

INT. TED'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as
ever.

                        TED
           Hey.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           You look great.

                        MARY
           Thanks.

She notices something.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           What's that?

                        TED
           Hm?

                        MARY
           On your ear, you've got something.

MARY'S POV - a HUGE LOAD is hanging off of Ted's earlobe like a
drop earring.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           It looks like a gob of...

Mary leans forward for a closer look. Ted is terrified.

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (making face)
           Is that....hair gel?

BEAT.

                        TED
           Sure.

                        MARY
           Oh great, I ran out.

Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and WIPES
IT IN HER BANGS.

EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Healy is still following Tucker in his car. Finally Tucker stops
in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza
and wearing a PIZZA DELIVERY HAT.

Healy SCREECHES to a sideways stop, jumps out and POUNCES ON HIM.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You motherfucker, you're a dead man!

Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.

                        TUCKER
                 (cowering)
           Okay, Pat, take it easy--don't do anything
           stupid.

                        HEALY
           Who the fuck do you think you are making up
           that bullshit about me?!

Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN.

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa--I don't know what you're talking
           about.

                        HEALY
           Maybe this'll jog your memory.

Healy SLAPS him across the face.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'll give you a hint--it's got something to
           do with me being a murderer.

Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, okay, I might've gotten some bad
           information.

Healy grabs him by the collar.

                        HEALY
           That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're
           working for him, aren't you, you little
           shit?

                        TUCKER
           Who?

Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.

                        HEALY
           This is your last chance, you fuck. Now
           either you come clean or I'm going to kick
           your ass from here to Tallahassee.

Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.

                        TUCKER
           I LOVE HER, OKAY?!

Tucker suddenly gets emotional. Healy stops and looks at him.

                        HEALY
           You what?

                        TUCKER
           You heard me, goddamnit. I...I love her.

Healy slowly lets go.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I'm a phony--just like you, man.

                        HEALY
           What do you mean?

                        TUCKER
           I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no
           architect. Don't be a putz--who's been to
           Santiago twice in a year?
                 (scoffing)
           Estadio Olimpico--please!

                        HEALY
           But...but you knew people at Harvard.

                        TUCKER
           I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that
           you were a fake and I made up everything
           else.
                 (sighs)
           My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.

                        HEALY
           Bullshit!

Tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his PIZZA DELIVERY BADGE, with
him pictured beside the name Norman Plante. As Healy let's this
sink in, we

Ted's rolling a little wine around in a glass. He takes a sip,
nods his approval.

INT. ANOTHER BAR - NIGHT

Healy and Tucker are bonding over a beer.

                        TUCKER
           ...So then in '94 I went back to Dade
           Community College for a semester and when
           the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I
           hooked up with the Pizza Barn.

                        HEALY
           And you met Mary how?

                        TUCKER
           Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her
           one night and she answered the door in her
           nightgown--that was it for me. I went home
           that night, shaved my beard, and a week
           later I was laid out in her office with a
           broken back.

                        HEALY
           How'd you manage that one?

           Nice.

                        TUCKER
           Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine
           until you showed up.

                        HEALY
           Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started
           telling bald-faced lies about the
           competition--that's crossing the line!

                        TUCKER
           What line? The day you first laid your oily
           rap on my future wife you started a war!

                        HEALY
           Future wife? Get real, man--you're
           nothing more than a glorified brother in
           her eyes.

                        TUCKER
           Why you son of a--

Tucker grabs Healy by the jacket.

                        HEALY
           Okay, calm down, calm down--the bottom line
           is neither of us are going to get her if we
           don't do something about that headcase

Mary smiles coyly.

           Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.

Mary is amused by this.

           Nitrate-sicles--I like that.

                        TED
           I say they should put more meats on a
           stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets

Healy is throwing DOGGIE TREATS through an open THIRD-FLOOR
WINDOW.

We hear the TELEVISION and see Magda DOZING on the couch with a
watery COCKTAIL IN HER HAND and the dog Puffy at her feet.

Suddenly a DOGGIE TREAT flies through the window, landing on the
rug. Puffy SNAPS TO ATTENTION and approaches the treat. He sniffs
it, then GOBBLES IT UP. ANOTHER doggie treat lands beside him and
he eats that, too. Then ANOTHER.

EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - SAME

Tucker keeps throwing the treats up and Healy looks concerned.

           when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm

           dumb before we get started so I think I

Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.

As Ted and Mary ENTER, we see Magda HOLDING UP THE COUCH with one
hand and VACUUMING WITH THE OTHER.

Mary doesn't know what to make of it.

                        MARY
           Magda, what are you doing?

Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled
with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.

           Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the
           bathroom.

As the O.S. YAPPING AND BANGING continues, Magda PICKS UP THE
TELEVISION and starts DUSTING the TV stand.

           you let the dog out of the bathroom.

                        TED
           Yeah, sure.

Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND
until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER
now and he NOTICES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM HESITATE.

TED'S POV - the bottom part of the door is being DENTED OUTWARD
from the force of something BATTERING IT FROM WITHIN.

Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.

jugular!

Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog ON
HIS FACE. He KNOCKS OVER A LAMP, tumbles onto the floor, and
fights for his life.

Mary and Magda SCREAM as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor. Ted
tries to CRAWL TOWARD THE DOOR but Puffy GRABS THE CUFF OF HIS
PANTS.

                 (out of breath)
           Tell him...to calm down.

Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.
Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.

They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS
HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS
AT TED'S NECK.

Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!

           on me and trick me into thinking you were
           someone I could...really go for?

Mary starts to get emotional.

                        TED
           Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

                        MARY
           Then what the fuck did you do it for?

                        TED
           I did it because because I'd never
           stopped thinking about you and if I didn't
           find you I knew my life would never be good
           again.

Mary looks away.

                        MARY
                 (softly)
           Please leave.

                        TED
                 (devastated)
           Mary, come on...

                        MARY
           Go!

                        TED
                 (beat)
           Okay.

And so Ted does.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and
forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow
angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF
PAPER.

TED'S POV - the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court
Street, apt. 43.'

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment
43. He KNOCKS on the door but no one answers. He tries the handle
and THE DOOR OPENS.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 

Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG
SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across
the carpet.

                        TED
           Hello...?

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks
behind the door.

Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when
they see the MESS.

                        HEALY
           Ho-ly shit.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

                        HEALY
           Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!

Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs Healy
by the collar.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (alarmed)
           Hey, hey, hey!

                        TED
           Surprised?

                        TUCKER
           Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.

                        TED
                 (to Tucker)
           Who the fuck are you?

                        HEALY
           He's in love with Mary, too.

Ted releases Healy and glares at him.

                        TED
           You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?

                        HEALY
                 (righteous)
           What do you mean 'why'?

                        TED
           Answer the question, shitball.

                        TUCKER
           I think everybody could use a drink.

Tucker goes into the kitchen.

                        HEALY
           Look, you asked me to follow your girl
           around, and I did and I started to like
           her, and then I realized I just couldn't in
           good conscience do it.

                        TED
                 (amazed)
           Do what?

                        HEALY
           Turn her over to a stalker.

                        TED
           What?! You're calling me a stalker?

                        HEALY
           That's right--if you weren't you would've
           looked for her yourself!

Suddenly they hear a SOUND and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering
into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (sickened)
           Oh Christ...poor dog.

                        TED
           You're a sick man, you know that?

                        HEALY
           Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand
           the fact that it was my turn.

                        TED
           Your turn?

                        HEALY
                 (getting emotional)
           That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's
           the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever
           get the great girl? Give the big pig with
           the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick
           of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was
           time for me...time for me...to be happy.

This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down,
runs his fingers through his hair.

                        TED
           Well you didn't have to blow us both out of
           the water. Jesus Christ, just because she
           found out about you, why'd you have to take
           me down with you?

                        HEALY
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                        TED
           I'm talking about the letter, asshole.

                        HEALY
           What? 

Ted stares at him.

                        TED
           Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a
           letter outlining our deal?

                        HEALY
           Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be
           screwing myself.

The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen
with a drink. They turn their attention to him.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You little fuck.

                        TUCKER
           What?

                        HEALY
           You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said
           you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck
           you until we had this fuck out of the
           fucking picture.
                 (moves in on Tucker)
           You crossed the line, man.

Tucker backs away nervously. 

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why
           would I cross the line--what do you think I
           got no pride?

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You
           probably did it yourself, you piece of
           shit.

                        HEALY
           Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I
           rat myself out?

                        TUCKER
           Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy
           who's idea of courting is blowing farts in
           the chick's face

                        HEALY
           You were following us?

                        TUCKER
           Don't flatter yourself--I was following
           her, I always do. How the hell you think
           I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

This gets Ted's attention.

                        TED
           You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff
           about Warren?

                        TUCKER
           Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?
           He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two
           should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't
           for me, she might've married that schmuck!

Ted thinks about this.

                        TED
           The hell with you both--I'm out of here.

Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each
other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom
with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take,
then looks back at the snake.

                        HEALY
                 (sadly)
           Oh...Sully.

                        TUCKER
           Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter,
           and it wasn't me who sent it?

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE ON an alarmed Mary.

                        MARY
           Woogie? What are what are you doing here?

REVERSE ANGLE reveals Dom sitting on her bed.

                        DOM
           Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about 
           Ted?

                        MARY
           You sent that?

                        DOM
           Uh-huh. I was worried about you.

                        MARY
           Well...thank you. But...you know you're not
           supposed to be within four hundred yards of
           me.

                        DOM
                 (excited)
           That's what I want to tell ya. I've been
           through two years of extensive
           psychotherapy and you know what? You were
           right--I needed help.

                        MARY
                 (cautious)
           That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're
           better--you seem...good--but...you put me
           through quite an ordeal, you know.

Dom nods aggressively.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I had to move, go to court, change my last
           name--you stole all my shoes!

Dom stands up.

                        DOM
           Look at me.

Mary turns her head.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on
           God above, on everything that is holy to
           me, I did not steal your shoes.

                        MARY
           Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

                        DOM
           All right, I did, but I was in a weird
           place then.

He approaches her.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!

Mary backs into the living room.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - DAY

Healy and Tucker are parked right out front LISTENING TO THIS
CONVERSATION. They seem concerned.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.

                        HEALY
           Who the hell's Woogie?

Tucker just shrugs.

BACK ON Mary and Dom. =~

                        MARY
           I'm asking you to leave.

                        DOM
                 (gentle)
           Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all
           wrong.
                 (beat)
           I'm not leaving...

BACK IN HEALY'S CAR 
                        DOM (cont'd) (V.O.)
           ...Not until I get a little something to
           remember you by.

                        MARY (V. O . )
                 (clearly struggling)
           Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!

Healy and Tucker jump out of the car and RUN INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Healy and Tucker STORM INTO THE ROOM and freeze at what they see.

THEIR POV - Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms
and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back.

                        MARY
           Stop it!

                        DOM
           Just one pair! You owe me that much, you
           heartless bitch!

Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.

                        HEALY
           Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your
           friend Ted like that.

                        DOM
           What? You fucked him over, too.

                        HEALY
           He's no friend of mine.

Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten
BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting
a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.

                        MAGDA
           What the hell's going on here?

At first no one knows what to say. Then:

                        HEALY
           We're in love with your roommate.

                        MAGDA
           Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm
           gonna pack my bags and go back to my own
           place.

Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.

                        MARY
           Tucker, where are your crutches?

Tucker is stumped for a second, then:

                        TUCKER
                 (British accent)
           Interesting query, Mary...

Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.

                        HEALY
           Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.

                        TUCKER
           Well isn't this nice--now we've got the
           whole gang together.

Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.

                        TED
           Dom? What are you?

                        DOM
           You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

                        MARY
                 (rolling eyes)
           Woogie and I went out for awhile in high
           school.

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           You're Woogie?

                        DOM
           Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

                        TED
           But but you're married. You have kids a
           great wife.

                        DOM
           If you're so happy with them, please, be my
           guest.

                        HEALY
           If I may I have a proposal.

Everyone turns to Healy.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I say none of us leave this room until our
           young Mary here stops jerking us around and
           decides once and for all who she wants. Now
           Mary, I know this is difficult but you
           really will be doing them all a favor to
           tell them the truth about us.

                        MARY
           Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're
           a murderer.

Healy glares at Tucker.

                        TUCKER
           Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I
           exaggerated a little there.

                        MARY
           You mean he's not a criminal?

                        HEALY
           God no!
                 (pleased)
           I'm just a pathological liar!

Mary looks at Tucker, confused.

                        MARY
           Tucker...not you, too?

Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

                        TUCKER
           Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my
           folks.

                        MARY
           Oh Jesus...

Just then the door opens and BRETT FAVRE, the Packers quarterback
ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is
stunned.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Brett...?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           Hi, Mary.

                        HEALY
           What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           We're in town to play the Dolphins.

                        TED
           I called him. I told him to pick up Warren
           and get over here.

everyone turns their attention to Ted.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Mary, I found out that your buddy Tucker
           there lied to you about Brett.

Tucker lowers his head.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Brett never said anything bad about Warren.
           He loves Warren...and from what he just
           told me on the phone, he loves you, too.
                 (beat)
           He's the guy you should be with.

                        BRETT FAVRE
           That's right, Mare. And you know I'll
           always be true to you.

                        DOM
           Aw shit, this isn't fair.

Mary manages a smile.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I realized something tonight. I'm no better
           than any of these guys. None of them really
           love you...they just fixated on you because
           of how you made them feel. But that's not
           real love...Thank you for letting me see
           that. Now I can get on with the rest of my
           life.

Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.

                        TUCKER
           Oh please...

                        DOM
           Don't listen to him, Mary. It's a ploy.

                        HEALY
           You are so full of shit, Strohman. Are you
           going to stand here and tell us that you
           aren't in love with this girl?

Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.

                        TED
           Yeah...that's what I'm telling you.
                 (winks)
           See you, Mare.

Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (as he passes Warren)
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Huh...?

Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear.

                        TED
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Bye, Ted.

Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence
for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.

                        DOM
           Hey, Brett, any chance I can get you to
           autograph one of these pumps for me?

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted is walking down the street BLUBBERING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL.
Everyone he passes stares at him. Suddenly Mary comes running down
the OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

                        MARY
           Ted!

Ted stops and looks across the street at her. He wipes his eyes,
hopeful.

                        TED
           What what are you doing here?

                        MARY
           You forgot your keys!

She holds up a RABBIT FOOT KEY-CHAIN.

                        TED
                 (deflated)
           Oh. Thanks.

They remain across the street from one another.

                        MARY
           Did you mean what you said back there, Ted?

Ted starts to well up again.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Ted...?

                        TED
                 (looking down)
           I...I just want you to be happy, Mary.

                        MARY
           But I think I'd be happiest...with you.

Ted just stares at her.

                        TED
           You're fucking with me, right?

Mary smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (wiping eyes)
           But but what about Steve?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy
           doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

Now Ted smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Get over here.

                        TED
           Really?

                        MARY
           Really.

The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a BUS
WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under the
bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and
TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.

Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.

                        MARY
           Ted, no, no....!

She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.

Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. The
crowd winces.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Somebody hold up traffic!
                 (beat)
           Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going
           to be okay.

Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

                        TED
           Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

                        MARY
           I love you too, Ted.
                 (beat)
           I think I always have.

As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:

                        LADY
           Over here! I found his foot! It was in the
           storm drain!

ON THE LADY as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.

                        MARY
           All right, everyone, let's fan out and look
           for the penis!

As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and

                                                       FADE OUT.

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT OCTOBER 21, 1997
FADE IN:

EXT. CUMBERLAND, RHODE ISLAND HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING

It's the early 1980's and everyone is arriving at school. We push
through the parking lot crowd to a nervous, lanky kid, TED
PELOQUIN.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           When I was sixteen years old I fell in
           love...

CLOSE ON - RENISE, a tough girl with stringy brown hair and a
shiny forehead, as she turns toward the camera.

                        TED
           Hey, Renise.

She barely looks at him as he approaches, just drags on her smoke.

                        RENISE
           Hey.

                        TED
           So what's up?

                        RENISE
           Eh.

                        TED
           Great. Great.
                 (beat)
           So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you
           wanted to go to the prom you know, with
           me.

Renise looks unenthused.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you
           want.

                        RENISE
           See, the thing is, I heard a rumor that
           this guy I like was gonna ask me.

                        TED
           Uh-huh.

                        RENISE
           Yeah, so...I'm gonna wait and see what
           happens there...But that sounds great,
           yeah.

Ted nods, confused.

                        TED
           Okay.
                 (beat)
           So is that a yes or a no?

                        RENISE
           I think I was very clear, Ted. If
           everything else falls apart, maybe.

Renise throws down her butt and storms off.

                        TED
           I'm gonna hold you to that.

                                                        CUT TO:

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE SCHOOL PARKING LOT

ANGLE ON - a pretty girl, MARY, climbing off a ten-speed in the
school parking lot. She's athletic and tanned and doesn't have a
bad bone in her body.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Her name was Mary. She'd moved to our
           little Rhode Island town from Minnesota two
           years earlier.

She locks up the bike and starts walking toward the school.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           Mary was very smart, and very cool, and she
           had a faceful of eyes that promised you a
           better life if you could only know her.

As she approaches the camera, we PAN to see Ted watching her. He's
sitting on a picnic table with two FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, dirtbud, who you going to the prom
           with?

Finally Ted takes his eyes off Mary.

                        TED
           Ah, I don't know if I'm even gonna. You
           know, not my style.

                        FRIEND #2
           You have a style?

                        FRIEND #1
           Why don't you be a gentleman and ask Rosey?

                        TED
                 (perks up)
           Who?

Friend #1 makes a jerk-off motion.

                        FRIEND #1
           Rosey Palm, your girlfriend. God knows you
           spend enough fucking time with her.

The guys LAUGH.

                        TED
                 (out of ammo but doesn't
                  know it)
           Yeah, and who are you gonna take, your own
           palm?

His friends stare at him.

                        FRIEND #1
           Clever. I like the way you just spun that
           around on me.

Friend #2 notices Mary talking to her FRIENDS.

                        FRIEND #2
           I wonder who she's going with.

                        FRIEND #1
           Some guy named Woogie.

                        TED
           Who?

                        FRIEND #1
           Big guy--goes to Barrington high school.

This irks Ted.

                        TED
           Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like
           a loser.

                        FRIEND #1
           Loser? Woogie was all-state football and
           and basketball and valedictorian of his
           class.

                        FRIEND #2
           I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton
           but he's going to Europe first to model.

This takes the wind out of Ted's sails.

                        FRIEND #3
           Yeah and he's got a huge cock.

Everyone looks at him.

                        FRIEND #3 (cont'd)
           I heard.

Suddenly Friend #1 NOTICES something.

                        FRIEND #1
           Hey, check it out.

THEIR POV - A large, goofy YOUNG MAN with an unfashionable
crewcut comes walking up the street. He's in his early twenties
and though the weather is mild he's WEARING EARMUFFS. He
approaches a GROUP OF KIDS sitting on a car hood.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #2
           No.

The kids watch as the Ear-Muff Guy approaches another group.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

ON CAR HOOD KIDS 
                        CAR HOOD KID #1
                 (to his buddies)
           This guy must be in the 'tard squad.
                 (to Ear-Muff Guy)
           Hey, buddy, come here, I think I know where
           your ball is.

The Ear-Muff Guy heads back to the car.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my baseball?

                        CAR HOOD KID #1
           Yeah, I seen it. That girl over there, she
           has it.

Car Hood Kid #1 points to a BUSTY GIRL leaning against another car
talking to her large BOYFRIEND.

                        CAR HOOD KID #2 (cont'd)
           'Cept she doesn't call it a baseball. She
           has another name for it...

                                                       CUT TO:

ON BUSTY GIRL - The Ear-Muff Guy marches up to her and her
boyfriend.

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

                        GIRL
           What?!

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           You seen my pecker?

The Boyfriend grabs him by the collar.

                        BOYFRIEND
           You son-of-a-bitch, I'll kick your ass!

The Boyfriend throws the Ear-Muff Guy to the ground and is about
to pummel him when Ted intervenes.

                        TED
           Take it easy, Smokey.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           This fucking pervert just came on to Nance!

                        TED
           All right, just be cool.
                 (under breath)
           He looks like he's not all there, you know
           what I mean?

A crowd starts to gather which only incites Smokey more.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           Get the fuck out of my way, man!

Smokey tosses Ted out of the way and moves toward the Ear-Muff
Guy. Just then Mary shows up and steps between them.

                        MARY
           What's going on here?

She bends down and helps the Ear-Muff Guy off the ground.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Are you all right?

                        EAR-MUFF GUY
           Mary, you seen my baseball?

                        MARY
           No, I haven't seen your baseball. Jeez,
           Warren, you know you're not supposed to
           leave the yard by yourself.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
                 (to Mary)
           You know him?

                        MARY
           He's my brother.

                        BOYFRIEND/SMOKEY
           Oh.
                 (beat)
           I didn't realize he was...you know...

At this, Smokey and his girlfriend reluctantly head toward the
school, along with most of the crowd.

Mary turns her attention in the direction Ted was thrown.

                        MARY
           You okay?

HER POV - Ted is sitting in a mud puddle. He stands and brushes
himself off.

                        TED
           Oh yeah. Fine.

                        MARY
           Thanks a lot, Ted.

CLOSE ON - Ted. He can't believe what he's just heard. As Mary
helps him up, she turns her attention to Warren.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           That she knew my name blew my mind. Some of
           my best friends didn't know my name.

EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING

Mary and a muddied Ted are walking Warren home. Warren lags
behind, mumbling to himself. Mary notices that Ted is limping.

                        MARY
           Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt
           yourself?

                        TED
           No, it's an old football injury.

                        MARY
           Oh, are you on the team?

                        TED
           No, a couple of the players and me were
           joking around and, uh, I fell off the
           school.

Warren approaches and motions for Ted to hop on his back.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride?

                        MARY
           Warren, come on, leave Ted alone.

Warren pats his back again.

                        WARREN
           Piggyback ride.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.

                        MARY
           Oh he can hold you. He weighs
           two-hundred-and-thirty pounds.

                        TED
           A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?

Ted hops onto Warren's back.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Giddy-up.

Warren walks about five feet and stops.

                        WARREN
           My turn now.

Off Ted's reaction, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT . MARY'S HOUSE - DAY

Muddy sweat is running down Ted's face as he struggles up a hill
with Warren on his back.

                        TED
                 (straining)
           We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?

                        WARREN
           Giddy-up.

Ted rolls his eyes and continues toward the front door. Mary looks
on, amused.

                        MARY
           So who you taking to the prom?

                        TED
           Huh?

                        MARY
           The prom--you going?

                        TED
           Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty
           dumb.

                        MARY
           'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go
           if you weren't already taking someone.

                        TED
           I mean dumb in the sense that they only
           happen once a year.

She smiles at this.

                        MAN'S VOICE (V.O.)
           From that moment on the guys at school
           looked at me in a whole new light.

           You're a fucking liar!

EXT. CUMBERLAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

PULLBACK TO REVEAL - Ted is leaning against his locker
surrounded by a group of guys.

                        FRIEND #2
           You expect us to believe you're going to
           the prom with Mary? What about Woogie?

                        TED
           They broke up. She said he started getting
           weird on her.

                        FRIEND #1
           I got twenty bucks says you're full of
           shit.

                        TED
           Oh come on, why would I lie?

                        FRIEND #1
           Because you're a loser, and in some warped
           way this gives you a momentary sense of
           worth.

                        FRIEND #2
           Put me down for fifty.

                        FRIEND #3
           I'm in.

As the others join in, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT

A tuxedoed and smiling Ted drives up in his parent's station
wagon.

EXT. MARY' S FRONT DOOR - TWILIGHT

Ted knocks on the door and Mary's gruff DAD answers.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Yeah? What do you want?

                        TED
           Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take
           Mary to the prom.

                        MARY'S DAD
           Prom? You're about twenty minutes late. She
           just left for the prom with her boyfriend
           Woogie.

Ted looks devastated. Suddenly the door swings open revealing
MARY'S MOM.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted.
           Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a
           joke a minute.

                        TED
           Oh.
                 (relieved)
           Oh, that's a good one.

INT. MARY'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT
Ted nervously enters and sees Warren watching T.V. in the den.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren.

Warren doesn't look his way.

Just then Mary comes down the stairs looking as if the directors
had really taken their time casting this role. Ted can't believe
his eyes.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           Hi, Mary.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Poor Teddy--he's been getting it both
           barrels from the Wisenheimer here.

                        MARY
           Dad, have you been busting Ted's chops?

Mary's Dad shrugs.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Warren, did you say hi to Ted?

                        WARREN
                 (not looking up)
           'Bout ten times.

                        TED
           Hey, Warren, I think I know where your
           baseball is.

This finally gets Warren's attention.

                        WARREN
           You seen my baseball?

We see Ted discreetly pull a BRAND NEW BASEBALL out of his pocket
and palm it in his hand.

                        TED
           Well, if it's a big white one with red
           stitching, I think I saw it right behind
           your ear ..

Ted is reaching behind Warren's ear when suddenly Warren TAKES A
SWIPE AT HIM, knocking him to the ground.

                        MARY
           Warren!!!

Ted HITS HIS HEAD on the coffee table.

ON THE BASEBALL - as it rolls under the couch, stopping right
next to the OTHER MISSING BALL.

BACK TO SCENE - In a split second, Warren is up like a cat and
DIVES ONTO TED. As MARY AND HER PARENTS SCREAM, Ted manages to
free himself from the disabled man's clutches and GETS WARREN IN A
HEADLOCK.

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (to Ted)
           What the hell are you doing?!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, let him go!

                        TED
                 (out of breath)
           I'm trying...tell him to...calm down.

The family jumps on Warren and finally break it up.

                        MARY'S DAD (cont'd)
                 (to Ted)
           Jesus Christ, guy, what the hell were you
           doing?!

                        TED
           I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a
           baseball.

                        MARY'S MOM
           What baseball? Where's a baseball?

Ted looks around but there's no ball in sight.

                        TED
           There was a ball I had a honest.

As Mary helps Ted up, we see that his shirttail is out and his tie
is hanging off. Mary's parents lead the frothing Warren back to
the couch.

                        MARY (to Ted)
           I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a
           thing about his ears.

                        TED
           Oh. Okay. I gotcha.

                        MARY
           Are you all right?

                        TED
           Oh yeah.

                        MARY'S MOM
                 (to Mary)
           Honey, now you're all wrinkled.

Mary looks down and frowns.

                        MARY
           Ted, will you just give me one more minute?
           I have to iron this thing.

Ted starts to tuck his pants in as Mary and her mother head back
up the stairs. Mary's Dad and Ted are left alone. And Warren.

Ted rubs his head, sees a spot of blood.

                        TED
                 (to Mary's Dad)
           May I use your bathroom?

INT. BATHROOM - TWILIGHT

Ted dabs his head with a tissue, then moves to the toilet. As he
TAKES A LEAK he glances out the window to his left.

TED'S POV - two LOVEBIRDS are perched on a branch.

Ted smiles...

...at the SOUND of these beautiful tweeties singing their love
song for themselves, for the spring, for Ted and Mary, and
suddenly they fly away and we...

SNAP FOCUS 
...to reveal Mary in the bedroom window DIRECTLY BEHIND WHERE THE
BIRDS WERE, in just a bra and panties, and just then her mother
glances Ted's way and MAKES EYE-CONTACT with what she can only
presume to be a leering Peeping Tom.

ON TED...

...he loses the smile and ducks his head back into the bathroom,
HORRIFIED.

PANICKING NOW, he hastily zips up his fly and

                        TED
           YEEEOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!

TED GETS HIS DICK STUCK IN THE ZIPPER!

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - NIGHT

A concerned Mary, her Mom, Dad, and Warren are huddled outside the
bathroom.

                        MARY
                 (knocking gently)
           Ted, are you okay?

                        TED (O.S.)
                 (pained)
           Just a minute.

                        MARY'S MOM
           He's been in there over half an hour.
                 (whispering)
           Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

                        MARY
           Mom!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Well he was watching you undress with a
           silly grin on his face.

                        TED (O.S.)
                 (pained)
           I was watching the birds!

They all look at one another.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Charlie, do something.

                        MARY'S DAD
           All right, kid, that's it, I'm coming in.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

A whimpering Ted huddles in the corner as Mary's Dad enters.

                        MARY'S DAD (cont'd)
           What seems to be the situation here? You
           shit yourself or something?

                        TED
           I wish.

Ted motions for him to close the door and Mary's Dad obliges.

                        TED (cont'd)
           I, uh...I got it stuck.

                        MARY'S DAD
           You got what stuck?

                        TED
           It.

                        MARY'S DAD
           It?
                 (beat)
           Oh it. All right, these things happen,
           let me have a look. It's not the end of the
           world.

Mary's Dad moves closer and puts his reading glasses on.

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

As Mary, her Mom, and Warren listen in...

                        MARY'S DAD (O.S.)

                        TED
           What?! No please, sir--

                        MARY'S DAD
           She's a dental hygienist. She'll know what
           to do.

Mary's Mom comes in and closes the door behind her.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, hon, are you okay?
                 (moving closer, seeing the situation)
           OH HEAVENS TO PETE!

                        TED
           Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Just relax, dear. Now, um...what exactly
           are we looking at here?

                        TED
                 (dizzy)
           What do you mean?

                        MARY'S MOM
                 (delicate)
           I mean is it...is it...?

                        MARY'S DAD
                 (gruff)
           Is it the frank or the beans?

                        TED
           I think a little of both.

Suddenly we hear Warren from outside the door:

                        WARREN (O.S.)
           Franks and beans!

Ted hangs his head.

EXT. BATHROOM DOOR - CONTINUOUS

Mary and Warren are huddled outside the door.

                        MARY
                 (to Warren)
           Shhhh.

                        MARY'S DAD (O.S.)
           What the hell's that bubble?

Mary REACTS to this.

INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

                        TED
           One guess.

                        MARY'S DAD
           How the hell'd you get the beans all the
           way up top like that?

                        TED
           I don't know. It's not like it was a well
           thought-out plan.

                        MARY'S MOM
           Oh my, there sure is a lot of skin coming
           through there.

                        MARY'S DAD
           I'm guessing that's what the soprano shriek
           was about, pumpkin.

                        MARY'S MOM
           I'm going to get some Bactine.

                        TED
           No, please!

Suddenly a POLICE OFFICER sticks his head in the bathroom window.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Ho there.

                        TED
                 (humiliated)
           Oh God.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Everything okay here? Neighbors said they
           heard a lady scream.

                        MARY'S DAD
           You're looking at him. C'mere and take a
           look at this beauty.

                        TED
           No, that's really unneces--

But the Officer's already climbing in the window. Once inside, he
turns his flashlight on Ted and WHISTLES.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Now I've seen it all. What the hell were
           you thinking?

                        TED
                 (frustrated)
           I wasn't trying--

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Is that bubble what I think it is? 

Mary's parents nod.

                        POLICE OFFICER (cont'd)
           But...how...how'd you get the zipper all
           the way to the top?

                        MARY'S DAD
           Let's just say the kid's limber.

The Officer makes a face, then rolls up his sleeves.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Well, there's only one thing to do.

                        TED
           No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my
           shirttail out and work on it in the
           morning.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Look, son, this'll only hurt for a second.

The Officer reaches down and takes hold of the zipper.

                        TED
           No, no, please!

                        MARY'S MOM
           Teddy, be brave.

                        WARREN (O.S.)
           Beans and franks!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Warren, shhh.

Defeated, Ted holds his breath and braces for the worst.

                        POLICE OFFICER
           It's just like pulling off a Band-aid.
           A-one and a-two and...

EXT. MARY'S HOUSE - NIGHT

TWO PARAMEDICS rush Ted out the front door on a stretcher. Mary
runs alongside him holding a towel on his crotch. while a THIRD
PARAMEDIC dabs at his crotch with a towel. Mary's Mom and Dad are
out front along with two FIRETRUCKS, four POLICE CARS, and a crowd
of about thirty NEIGHBORS.

                 (to Mary)
           Keep pressure on it!

Mary does as she's told.

                 (running along)
           Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be

He gives her two thumbs up as they slide him into the ambulance.

Ted, now in his 30's, lays on his therapist's couch.

                        TED
           ...Anyway, school ended a few days later
           and that July her father got transferred to
           Florida.

The CAMERA PANS up to reveal that the CHAIR BEHIND HIM IS EMPTY.
Ted has been telling all this to no one.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It took me half the summer to pay off all
           those bets.
                 (sighs)
           I never did see Mary again. That was about
           twelve years ago.

Just then the door quietly opens and Ted's PSYCHIATRIST tip-toes
back into the room and takes his seat. (He has a dab of mustard on
his chin and has forgotten about the cloth napkin tucked into his
collar.)

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Uh-huh. Interesting.

The Psychiatrist notices the napkin and quickly wipes his chin,
then tosses it aside.

                        TED
           Anyway, it's not something you exactly
           forget about, but I guess I must've blocked
           it out of my head. Then about a week ago
           I'm driving on the highway and I got to
           thinking about Mary and suddenly I couldn't
           breathe...I couldn't keep up with the flow
           of traffic anymore I felt like I was
           going to die. I pulled into a rest area,
           parked the car, and just started shaking.

The Psychiatrist scratches his chin.

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           You know...rest areas are homosexual
           hang-outs.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        PSYCHIATRIST
           Highway rest areas--they're the bathhouses
           of the nineties for some gay men.

Ted thinks about this, then glances back at the shrink.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Ted and his friend DOM are blasting a couple buckets.

                        DOM
           Gay? He said you were gay?

                        TED
           He implied it.

                        DOM
           Well you're a writer, and a lot of
           writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.

                        TED
           Yeah, but he was successful.

                        DOM
           Let me ask you this: When you smoke a
           cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?

Ted appears to think about this.

                        TED
           Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.

                        DOM
           I'm going to fix you up with my new
           assistant.

                        TED
           What's he like?

Dom LAUGHS, then watches as Ted hits a ball.

                        DOM
           You're leaving it out. Finish your swing.
                 (beat)
           You're going to like this one--she's half
           Asian, half American.

                        TED
           Good-looking?

                        DOM
           I just told you, she's half Asian. half
           American. They're all good looking. You
           could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and
           they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's
           a foolproof combo.

Ted thinks about it.

                        TED
           What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm
           in a slump.
                 (SIGHS)
           Lately I've been feeling like...well...like
           a loser.

                        DOM
           Loser? You?

Ted shrugs.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break. Remember five years ago,
           when your kidneys failed? If you were a
           loser would they have been able to find a
           donor with an exact tissue match? What are
           the odds of that, one in a million?

                        TED
           Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got
           killed in an explosion?

                        DOM
           I never said that. I'm saying your lucky
           those kids found his kidneys.
                 (beat)
           Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a
           shit about you.

Ted gives him a look.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           You know, you're a real glass-is-half-empty
           guy. You got a fucking guardian angel, man.

Ted manages a small smile. Just then, Ted's cell phone RINGS.

                        TED
           I gotta take this, it might be my boss.
                 (flips phone open)

           You're a cocksucking motherfucking piece of
           puke!

Whoever it is HANGS UP. Without reacting, Ted closes the phone and
puts it back in his pocket.

           Yep.

EXT. DOM'S HOUSE - DAY

Dom and Ted are drinking beer while sitting on Dom's front steps.
We see signs of kids everywhere: a tricycle, six-foot basketball
hoop, dolls, etc.

DOM'S WIFE comes out and hands them each a cigar.

                        DOM'S WIFE
           I thought you guys might like these with
           your beers.

                        DOM
           Thanks, baby.

She goes back inside.

                        TED
           See, that's what I want. I don't need these
           bimbettes you got me chasing. I want what
           you have. A family....Someone to...you
           know...love.

These guys don't usually talk about this crap, and Ted gets a
little embarrassed.

                        TED (cont'd)
           It must be great with a wife like that.

                        DOM
           Each day is better than the next.

           Have you ever been, you know...in love with
           someone?

           Nah.

           Never?

                        TED
           Well once. Mary.

Dom SIGHS.

                        DOM
           Mary again.

                        TED
           Look, I admit it was brief, but it was
           definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve
           years.

                        DOM
           Whatever happened to Mary?

                        TED
           I told you, her family moved to Miami.

                        DOM
           I mean since then.

                        TED
           I don't know.

                        DOM
           Well why don't you look her up?

                        TED
                 (sarcastic)
           Yeah, right.

                        DOM
           Why not?

                        TED
           Because I guarantee she's married and has a
           couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay
           single.

                        DOM
           What if you're wrong? You just said she's
           the only girl you ever loved, what have you
           got to lose by calling her?

                        TED
           I did try calling her.
                 (sheepish)
           A few years ago. She wasn't listed.

                        DOM
           So that was it? One bump in the road and
           you gave up?

                        TED
           I also called Unsolved Mysteries.

                        DOM
           You're kidding? What did they say?

                        TED
           They told me they don't help out stalkers.
                 (beat)
           Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long
           time.

                        DOM
           I got it--you hire a private eye, fly him
           out there, he follows her around a couple
           days, she'll never know a thing.

Ted considers this.

                        TED
           No. No fucking way. That's too creepy.

Dom thinks a moment, then SNAPS his fingers.

                        DOM
           Wait a second. There's a guy named Healy in
           my office who might be able to help you
           out. He's a claims investigator and he goes
           to Miami every couple weeks.

As Ted thinks about this, we

           Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple
           years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston
           office; some bullshit about padding his
           resume--like we haven't all done that.
           Anyway, they were going to let him go but
           his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that
           ended up on my desk.

                        TED
           His mother?

                        DOM
           Yeah, I guess he still lives with her.
           Seemed like a sweet lady--got diabetes or
           something--so I went out on a limb and got
           him transferred down to Providence.

                        TED

                        DOM
           He'll do better than that. I'll send him
           down to Miami on business, you throw him a
           couple bucks on the side, and he'll track
           her down.

           She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago.
           I checked directory assistance down there
           and she's not listed. She might've moved
           ten times since then.

           What can I tell you? It's a healthier
           lifestyle down here, and it's easier to
           succeed when your head's clear. Those guys

                        SULLY
           Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta
           quit the booze, too.

                        HEALY
           Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm
           proud of you.

Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here, just have one of these then.

                        SULLY
           Healy, what I just tell you?

                        HEALY
           This is a light beer. You can't have a
           light beer?

                        SULLY
           No I can't.

Healy stares at him, baffled.

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ
           sakes.
                 (holds up beer)
           Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

Sully stares at the beer, weakening.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm worried about you, man. You better
           learn to have a pop once in a while or
           you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're
           being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

                        SULLY
           Am I?

                        HEALY
           Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to
           hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You
           gotta learn how to bend a little or believe
           me...you're gonna break.

Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then
sips.

                        SULLY
           Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't
           even taste good to me anymore.

                        HEALY
           Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are
           you, spotting?

Healy takes the beer from Sully and as he chugs it, we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN

Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours,
food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type
HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE
attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.

Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted
awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the
binoculars toward...

HEALY'S POV - MARY'S APARTMENT ACROSS THE STREET

Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The
music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and
shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over
her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed,
wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she
still looks well cast.

CLOSE UP - ON HEALY - he's become extremely interested in his
work. As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to
do--he speaks into a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER:

                        HEALY
                 (into recorder)
           Okay, Ted, I found your Mary. Her current
           address, two-niner-eight Euclid Avenue,
           Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children
           and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass,
           affirmative.

INT. MARY'S APT. - DAY

Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, MAGDA,
sitting on the couch LISTENING to a stack of RADIO SCANNERS.

                        MARY
           Have you been up all night again?

                        MAGDA
           Bet your ass I have. It's an important job,
           Neighborhood Watch is.

                        MARY
           Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call
           listening in on stranger's phone
           conversations?

                        MAGDA
           These ain't strangers, they're neighbors.
           This only picks up signals in a half-mile
           radius.

                        MARY
           Meaning?

                        MAGDA
           Meaning these are the people you live
           amongst, you got a right to know if they're
           creeps. For instance, did you know there's
           a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?

                        MARY
                 (feigning shock)
           You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta
           move.

                        MAGDA 
           I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew
           something was up because Puffy used to bark
           like hell whenever he saw him and you know
           Puffy only barks at bad people.

Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.

                        MARY
           Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.

                        MAGDA
           That's because there's a lot of bad people
           out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you
           about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was
           a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out
           for yourself, didn't you?

                        MARY
           Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep,
           huh.

Mary gives Magda a kiss and heads to her bedroom.

                                                       CUT TO:

MUSIC MONTAGE - as Healy follows Mary around town.

EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING

Mary exits her apartment and bounces out into the world. There is
a HOMELESS MAN sitting on the sidewalk. Mary flips him an apple,
then jumps in her Honda Civic and drives off.

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - MORNING

Mary is at the range HITTING a couple buckets of balls.

ON HEALY - watching from the parking lot.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Looks like we got an athlete on our hands.

EXT. MACDONALD'S DRIVE-THRU WINDOW - MORNING

Mary waits in the drive-thru lane reading the SPORTS PAGE. Finally
the window opens and she is handed a HUGE BAG OF FOOD.

PAN TO Healy watching from his car.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Well, from her figure and her appetite, I'm
           guessing she's either got a bowel disorder
           or we've got a hurler on our hands.

EXT. SPECIAL ED. CENTER - MORNING

Mary's brother Warren is wearing a walkman as he plays catch out
front with a SPECIAL ED TEACHER while several other
MENTALLY-DISABLED PATIENTS entertain themselves.

Mary pulls up, gets out, and starts handing out Egg McMuffins.

                        MARY
           Get in line. One at a time.

A fat patient, GARY, approaches.

                        GARY
           Can I have two, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, you can have two halves, just like
           everyone else.

                        GARY
           Thanks.

Gary takes his and walks off. A couple more patients and then
bucktoothed FREDDIE steps up to her.

                        FREDDIE
           Will you marry me, Mary?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, pretty boy? And what about
           Dolores?

Mary points to another PATIENT staring bashfully at Freddie.

                        FREDDIE
           Would you marry us both, Mary?

                        MARY
           Yeah, that'd be a good deal for you,
           wouldn't it?

Freddie moves off and fat Gary is back, trying to be
inconspicuous.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Wow, this is weird. There was somebody who
           looked just like you here a minute ago.

Mary smiles and hands Gary another McMuffin.

CLOSE ON Healy.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Ixnay on the big appetite.
                 (beat)
           She's just got a big heart.

EXT. BEACH BAR - DAY

Neighborhood restaurant and bar. After-work crowd. Mary and her
friends, BRENDA, LISA, and JOANIE are sitting at a table under an
umbrella. Lisa reads from the PERSONALS COLUMN in South Beach
Magazine.

                        LISA
           Listen to this one--'Seeking sensitive Wasp
           doctor to share candlelit dinners, long
           walks in Coconut Grove, marriage.'

                        BRENDA
           What does this girl want, a corpse? You
           gotta be more specific: 'Seeking deaf mute
           with three pound cock and trust fund.'

                        JOANIE
           No, it should be 'a hockey player with
           great pecs.'

                        MARY
           Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those
           guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana
           hammock.

PAN TO the bar where we see Healy eavesdropping on their
conversation.

                        BRENDA (O.S.)
                 (to Mary)
           I suppose you wouldn't like someone with a
           washboard stomach like Brad Pitt?

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        MARY
           I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a
           bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy.
           You can have those pretty boys who hang out
           in a gym all day staring at their
           reflections.

ON HEALY 
                        HEALY
                 (quietly into mic)
           A girl after your own heart, Ted.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANIE
           I can live with those reflections.

                        MARY 
           I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies.
           Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer
           and playing thirty-six holes and still has
           enough energy to take me and Warren out to
           a ballgame.

                        JOANIE
                 (sarcastic)
           Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going
           to find a guy like that.

                        MARY
           But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking
           about has got to be self-employed.

                        LISA
           You mean, like an architect or something?

                        MARY
           Architect, yeah.

BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.

                        MARY
           No, it's not the money. Creative, yeah,
           that's good, but it's the freedom I'm
           talking about. See, this guy has to have a
           job he could do anywhere. That way we could
           just up and leave at the drop of a hat.

                        LISA
           And where would you and your beer-bellied
           architect be leaving to?

                        MARY
           I don't know. The Super Bowl, New Orleans
           Jazz Festival...maybe a couple months in
           Nepal.

                        JOANIE
           Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy
           halfway to Katmandu.

                        MARY
           What's that supposed to mean?

                        JOANIE
           It means you're too hard on guys.

                        MARY
           No I'm not.

                        JOANIE
           Oh come off it, Mare. What about
           what's-his-name...Steverino? You could've
           at least passed the baton on that one.

The girls LAUGH.

                        MARY
           Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for
           awhile.

                        JOANIE
           All right for awhile? The guy's
           good-looking, rich, witty. He was a god.

                        LISA
           At one point you were talking about
           marrying him. Come on, why'd you dump him?

Mary thinks about this.

                        MARY
           I don't know, it was complicated. He's in
           San Francisco, I'm in Miami.
                 (dodging question)
           Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.

                        JOANIE
           Is that old crab still with you? Mary, you
           said you were putting her up for a
           month--it's been a year and a half.

                        MARY
           Ah, she's okay.

                        LISA
           Mary, cut the crap, what really happened
           with Steve?

                        MARY
           Nothing. I mean, you know my brother.
                 (sighs)
           Warren.

                        JOANIE
           What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.

                        MARY
           I don't want someone who'll put up with
           him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the
           way I do. Do you know what he told my
           friend Tucker? He said he would've popped
           the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't
           in my life.
                 (beat)
           Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn
           lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.

Everyone is touched by this. Then:

                        BRENDA
           Well, that's the last time I blow him
           behind your back.

As the girls LAUGH, we

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Healy sits out front in his car again waiting for Mary to get
home. He picks up the phone, dials a number, and someone answers
but doesn't speak.

                        HEALY
           Hello...? Sully...?
                 (beat)
           Sully, that you?

                        SULLY (V.O.)
                 (over phone)
           Who the fuck is it to you?

                        HEALY
           Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over
           there?

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Sully is sitting on the kitchen floor in his police uniform, a
ring of white around his nostrils. The room is littered with beer
cans, he has another one in his hand, there's a pile of cocaine
and a rolled-up bill on the breakfast table. The dog and the snake
are in the doorway looking at him with concern.

                        SULLY
                 (into phone, sloshed)
           Fuckin' Patrick Healy, you think your shit
           don't stink. Well I got news for
           you--you're goddamn right it don't! How the
           hell are ya?!

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy looks at the phone, concerned.

                        HEALY
           Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know
           I'll have your car back in a couple hours,
           I'm still staking out this girl's
           apartment.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           You found my car?!

Just then Healy notices Mary pull up and park. He slides down in
his seat.

ON MARY - she gets out carrying a bag and approaches the
Homeless Man, who is still sitting on the sidewalk. She hands him
the bag.

                        HOMELESS MAN
           Thanks, Mary.

                        MARY
           You watch out for yourself, Herb.

As Mary bounds up the steps of her building, we

HOLD ON the Homeless Man as he happily takes a sandwich and soda
out of the bag.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Mary rushes into the apartment, Magda is glued to her radio
scanner, listening intently.

                        MAGDA
           Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this--some
           cop's staking out this broad's apartment.

                        MARY
           No time, Magda, my show's starting.

BACK ON HEALY...

... he can hear the conversation through the SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT
pointed at Mary's place.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his
           partner's all lubed up.

                        HEALY
                 (quietly into phone)
           Call you back.

                        SULLY
                 (over phone)
           God, I miss ya, ya fuck-

Healy hangs up abruptly.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

                        MAGDA
           Ah, Christ, I lost 'em.

Mary runs into her bedroom, shuts the door and flips on the tube
just as ESPN Sportscenter's OPENING THEME SONG is playing.
Relieved, Mary lays back on her bed and starts watching.

                                                       DISSOLVE TO:

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

Mary is now watching Andy Griffith while SMOKING A JOINT and
GIGGLING away in bed.

ON HEALY - he's sitting in his car, GIGGLING, too.

                        HEALY
           Fucking Barney...he never learns...

INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT

As the show's end credits start to WHISTLE AWAY, Mary stands and
starts to UNDRESS for bed.

BACK ON HEALY - he sits up, very interested now.

                        HEALY
                 (into mic)
           Here we go, Teddo. Here comes the money
           shot.

Healy quickly reaches in the back seat and pulls out a bigger,
MORE POWERFUL PAIR OF BINOCULARS.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - we're CLOSE ON the wrinkliest,
saggiest, droopiest set of milkbags on the planet.

ON HEALY - he cringes.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Oooof. First chink in the armor, Teddy
           Boy....

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - He moves his view up from the tits to
reveal...MAGDA UNDRESSING for bed.

ON HEALY - He flinches, sickened by his mistake, then
repositions the binoculars dead left to the next window.

HEALY'S BINOCULAR POV - moving over to the next window we see...
Mary as she just finishes putting on some sexy t-shirt.

ON HEALY - as he starts to drool.

EXT. PROVIDENCE - THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted is sitting alone having a beer when a smiling Healy
approaches.

                        HEALY
           I've got some very, very good news for you,
           my friend.

                        TED
           Really?
                 (perking up)
           Very, very?

Healy sits down and motions for a beer.

                        HEALY
           I think your life's about to change.

                        TED
           So you found Mary?

                        HEALY
           Right there in Liberty City. And you were
           right, she's really something.

                        TED
                 (smiles)
           So she hasn't changed?

                        HEALY
           That I couldn't. say. Let me ask you
           something: Was she a little big-boned
           in high school?

                        TED
           No, not at all.

                        HEALY
           Well she must've packed on a few pounds
           over the years.

This doesn't dampen Ted's enthusiasm.

                        TED
           Mary's a little chubby, huh?

                        HEALY
           I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
           Not bad.

Ted's smile starts to fade.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids,
           you're going to put on a few pounds.

                        TED
           So she's married?

                        HEALY
           Nope. Never been.

                        TED
           Huh?

                        HEALY
           Four kids, three different guys.

                        TED
           Three different guys?

                        HEALY
           Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two
           whites, and a midget.

                        TED
           Oh my.

                        HEALY
           Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to
           keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.

                        TED
           She's in a wheelchair?!

Ted looks completely drained.

                        HEALY
           Don't look so shocked, it's been a long
           time. I bet you've changed a lot over the
           last twelve years, haven't you?

                        TED
                 (shrugs)
           It's just that...Mary. I wouldn't have
           thought...

                        HEALY
           Anyway, the good news is I have all the
           information you need. Got it from her
           bookie--nice guy. You should definitely
           call her, Ted. I mean she's a real
           sparkplug, that one. She seems determined
           to get those rugrats off welfare and with
           your help I'll bet she does it.

Ted stands and starts moping away.

                        TED
           Thanks, Healy. Good work.

                        HEALY
           Ted? Don't you want the name of the
           housing project?

                        TED
           Uh, that's okay.

                        HEALY
           You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to
           hear from you before her mastectomy!

As Ted leaves, Healy puts his feet up on the table and sits back.

INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

We PAN across the room of unopened boxes to Ted laying awake in
bed. We hear HEAD-BANGER MUSIC coming from the apartment next
door. Finally Ted gets up and walks over to his dresser. As he
flips on a small light we see loose change, a balled-up Kleenex, a
few golf tees, and Ted's wallet. Ted picks up the wallet and opens
it.

TED'S POV - Inside is an an old high school photo of a smiling
Mary.

As Ted looks at it, he can't help but smile, too.

INT. PROVIDENCE UNION INSURANCE COMPANY - DAY

ON HEALY'S CUBICLE - Healy's taking his last boxload of crap out
of his cubicle when he spots Ted. He tries to duck back in but
Ted sees him. Healy forces a smile as Ted approaches.

                        TED
           What are you doing?

                        HEALY
           Oh, uh, I resigned.

Ted picks up a plane ticket off the desk.

                        TED
           Miami?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, this insurance business is too slow
           for me. I'm going to go down and try my
           hand at jai alai.

                        TED
           Jai alai?

                        HEALY
           Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at
           home in the fronton.

Healy starts walking out of the office and Ted follows. Healy is
having a hard time looking him in the eye. So he doesn't.

                        TED
           Look, uh, I've been thinking about
           everything you told me. 

                        HEALY
           Good good.

                        TED
           Well I think you're right, I should look 
           her up.

                        HEALY
           Rollerpig? Are you nuts?

                        TED
           But you said she was a sparkplug...?

                        HEALY
           I said buttplug. She's heinous.

Ted SIGHS and follows Healy out the front door.

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

They walk across the lot toward Healy's car.

                        TED
           All the same, I still want to call her. I
           know it sounds crazy--Mary sure has a lot
           of troubles in her life--but, I don't know,
           maybe I can help her out.
                 (sighs)
           The poor thing's had it tough--she's in a
           wheelchair for Godsakes.

                        HEALY
           It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.

                        TED
           Oh. I thought
                 (beat)
           That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't
           make any sense to you, but I just can't
           turn it off that fast. I still feel
           something for her.

Healy comes to his car and puts his stuff in the trunk.

                        HEALY
           Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number
           for you just as soon as she gets back from
           Japan.

                        TED
           Japan? What's she doing in Japan?

                        HEALY
           You've heard of mail-order brides? Well
           they go that way, too.

Ted is devastated. 

                        TED
           Mary's a mail-order bride?

                        HEALY
           Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget,
           it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the
           pound there. Sort of like tuna.

Off Ted's look, we

EXT. THE HOT CLUB - DAY

Ted and Dom are having a beer and a dog.

                        TED
           That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never
           procrastinate about anything again. Life is
           too fucking short. 

                        DOM
           Hey, look on the bright side--

                        TED
                 (interrupting)
           What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?

                        DOM
           Well...at least now you know.

                        TED
           I think it was better when I didn't. It was
           kind of inspiring to know there was someone
           so pure in the world.

As Ted dwells on this, Dom bursts out LAUGHING.

                        TED
           What's so funny?

                        DOM
           I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking
           this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're
           liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here
           you've been in therapy thinking you blew it
           with the greatest girl ever, and it turns
           out that getting your dick stuck in your
           zipper was the best thing that ever
           happened to you! 

Ted flinches at this.

                        TED
           Wait a second, I never told you that.

                        DOM
           Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away. 

Ted thinks it over.

                        TED
           Maybe you're right. I should look on the
           bright side. I mean, I've still got my
           health...
                 (checks watch)
           I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six
           a.m. to move my boss's brother into his
           apartment.

                        DOM
           What? On your day off? Do you even know
           the guy?

                        TED
           Never met him.

                        DOM
           Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn
           novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.

                        TED
           Amen to that.

EXT. MIAMI - DRIVING RANGE - DAY

Healy pays for a bucket of balls, then takes his clubs and strolls
jauntily to...

A GOLF TEE NEXT TO MARY'S 
Healy places a ball on the tee and takes a swing. He tops the ball
and it dribbles about ten yards.

                        HEALY
           Hit a house! Bite bite!
                 (to Mary)
           Haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

Mary nods. Healy takes another swing and duck-hooks one about
fifty yards. Mary addresses her ball, takes a smooth backswing,
and

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Hey, can you give me some tips here?

She cracks her shot long and straight.

                        MARY
           Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.

                        HEALY
           Thanks.

Mary tees up another ball and Healy puts down his club.

                        HEALY (cont'd) 
           I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?

                        MARY
                 (annoyed)
           No thanks.

Healy pulls out a huge wad of change from his pocket.

                        HEALY
           Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar?
           All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.

                        MARY
                 (interested)
           Nepal? Have you been?

                        HEALY
           Not in months. I don't even know why I
           bought the damn place.

                        MARY
           You own a home there?

                        HEALY
           Well...it's just a condo really. Right
           outside Katmandu.

                        MARY
           Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to
           go. Is it true the mountains are so tall
           you can't see the tops?

                        HEALY
           Not 'til you get about three hundred yards
           from the summit. That's been my experience
           anyway.

She looks impressed. Healy looks at his watch. 

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You know, I should just get going. I'll
           work on my game next week.

He flips her a coin.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.

                        MARY
                 (smiles)
           Thanks.

Healy starts to walk off. Mary doesn't know what to do. Will she
ever see this guy again?

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (CALLS after him)
           It was nice meeting you!

Healy doesn't answer or turn around. He just raises his hand and
gives her a little wave.

Mary shrugs her shoulders. Oh well...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE PARKING LOT - DAY

Healy is sitting in Sully's Chrysler LeBaron, right next to Mary's
Honda Civic.

He watches the rear-view mirror, and the moment he sees Mary
coming out from the driving range, he swings his legs out the door
and starts changing out of his golf shoes. As Mary tosses her
golf bag into the trunk, she notices Healy tying his shoes. A
second chance.

                        MARY
           Well, it was nice meeting you, again.

                        HEALY
           Same here again.

                        MARY
           By the way, what's your name?

                        HEALY
           Pat Healy.

There's an uncomfortable pause...Why doesn't this guy ask the
usual questions?

                        MARY
           Don't you want to know my name?

                        HEALY
           I already know it, Mary.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           How'd you know that?

                        HEALY
           It's right there on your golf bag.

Healy opens the back door to put away his golf shoes. Suddenly,
rolls and rolls of paper come tumbling out. Mary bends over to
help Healy pick them up.

                        MARY
           What are you doing with all these
           blueprints?

                        HEALY
           Some buildings I'm working on.

                        MARY
           Are you...an architect?

                        HEALY
           Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.

Mary stares at him, mouth agape.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call
           me an architect--it's just a job really, a
           way to keep me moving. My real passion is
           my hobby.

                        MARY
           What's that?

                        HEALY
           I work with retards.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           I beg your pardon?

                        HEALY
           You know...
                 (flaps lips with fingers)
           ...the guys who ride the short bus.

                        MARY
                 (put off)
           Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

                        HEALY
           The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me
           who I can and can't work with.

                        MARY
           No, I mean

                        HEALY
           --There's this one kid, we call him Mongo
           on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out
           of his cage once and--

                        MARY
           --He's in a cage?! 

                        HEALY
           Well it's more of an enclosure really.

                        MARY
           They keep him confined? That's bullshit!

                        HEALY
           That's what I said, so I went out and got
           him a leash you know, one of those
           clothesline runners for the backyard. He's
           got plenty of room out there to dig. The
           kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him
           to ball games, movies--you know, happy
           stuff.

                        MARY
           That sounds like fun.

                        HEALY
           Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven
           for me.
                 (getting emotional)
           Those goofy bastards are just about the
           best thing I have in this crazy old world.

           Ooh, hey, I gotta run.

EXT. PROVIDENCE APARTMENT - 7:45 A.M.

A profusely sweating Ted has a DRESSER ON HIS BACK and EEKS his
way toward the front door as his BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER catches
up to him IN A WHEELCHAIR. (The man is a quadriplegic who needs to
use a MOUTHPIECE to operate his chair.)

                        BOSS'S DISABLED BROTHER
           Hey, shit-for-brains, be careful not to

           fading.

           The thing's kind of heavy.

           Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know
           what heavy feels like, you insensitive
           prick.

           Yeah yeah. I'm going to the corner to get a
           cup of coffee.

The Boss's Disabled Brother bites into the mouthpiece and ZIPS
AWAY up the sidewalk. Ted takes a step. Rests. A step. Rests.

                        ASSERTIVE WOMAN'S VOICE

Ted glances back toward the street to see a T.V. NEWS REPORTER

           Yeah, that's more or less what the others
           said, too. Out getting coffee...supposed to

Ted turns and GLARES at him.

           I'm just saying...They sure made you look

Ted SIGHS. A couple big CRACKS of the neck.

           What's he like?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           I don't know. He's kind of a mook.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           What's a mook?

                        MARY (V.O.)

           Come on, Magda

           It's like that movie Harold and Maude.

           I don't watch the new ones.

                        MARY
           This one's almost thirty years old. It's
           about a young kid and an old lady who fall
           in love.

                        MAGDA
           That's exactly why I don't watch 'em
           anymore--it's bullshit! Why the hell would
           an old lady go for a young kid?

Mary smiles at this.

                        MARY
           The point is, love isn't about money or
           social standing or age, it's about
           connecting with someone, having things in
           common kindred spirits.

                        MAGDA
           Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy
           here's gonna tell you all you need to know
           about this guy in about two seconds flat.
           If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if
           Puffy's relaxed...well, you got yourself a

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Healy enters the building.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Healy tiptoes up to Mary's apartment door. He peeks through the
mail slot.

HEALY'S POV - Puffy is staring at him and GROWLING.

Healy reaches in his pocket, pulls out a VALIUM and a DOGGY TREAT.
Healy shoves the pill into the treat's soft center, examines it,
then thinks what the hell and SHOVES IN ANOTHER ONE.

Puffy GROWLS LOUDER. Healy pops the treat through the mail slot
and listens as the dog DEVOURS IT. Healy looks at his watch, then
sneaks back outside to wait a few minutes for the drugs to kick
in.

INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Healy is sitting on Mary's couch with Puffy spread-eagled
upside-down on his lap, KNOCKED OUT COLD. Mary and Magda look on
in amazement.

                        HEALY
                 (baby talk)
           Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum-tum
           rubbed, doesn't he now?

                        MARY
           Wow, I've never seen him like this. He
           doesn't usually like guys.

                        MAGDA
           You mean he doesn't like bad guys.

                        HEALY
           'That right?

                        MAGDA
           He can tell you're an animal nut. You are,
           aren't ya?

                        HEALY
           Truth is I usually get along better with
           animals than with people. In Nepal the
           villagers call me 'Kin-tan-tee', which
           means 'man who is loved by many animals...
                 (babbling)
           ...who love him a lot, too...and so on.'

Magda stares dreamily at Healy, smitten.

                        MAGDA
           Would you like a glass of tea or something?

                        HEALY
           You got a brew?

                        MARY
           Sure.
                 (noticing Magda's trance)
           Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more
           cheese and crackers...?

                        MAGDA
           Oh, yeah, of course, dear.

The two women go into the kitchen and Healy is left to pet the
MOTIONLESS DOG. Suddenly Healy notices that the dog is A LITTLE
TOO MOTIONLESS. Healy checks Puffy's pulse. He looks at his watch
to time the rate.

                        MARY (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           Great.

He starts SHAKING THE DOG, but Puffy doesn't move. Healy goes into
action. He starts pressing on his heart, PERFORMING DOGGIE CPR.
One-and-two-and-three, he continues trying to revive him.

                        MAGDA (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?

                        HEALY
                 (CALLING out)
           No, thanks.
                 (panicking)
           Love a little bundt cake if you have some!

INT. MARY'S KITCHEN - SAME

Magda and Mary are on their way out the door when they stop.

                        MAGDA
           Bundt cake?

                        MARY
                 (shrugs)
           Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can
           find some cookies.

As Magda starts to go through the cupboards...

INT. MARY'S FAMILY ROOM - SAME

A panicked Healy is giving the little mutt MOUTH-TO-MOUTH now.
Then back to the heart, the mouth, the heart, the mouth....

                        HEALY
                 (quietly, desperately, to Puffy)
           Come on, man, stay away from the light!

Healy resumes blowing into the dog's snout, pumping his chest,
with no results. Desperate, he picks up the cheese knife and
quickly SLICES THE WIRES ON TWO TABLE LAMPS.

Healy grabs the two wires and TOUCHES THEM TOGETHER LIKE A
DEFIBRILLATOR on the little pooch's chest.

ZZZZZTTTTTT - the dog BOUNCES a couple feet off the couch as
SPARKS FLY.

Healy takes his pulse again. Nothing. He ZAPS him once more with
the LIVE WIRES.

ZZZZZTTTTT - Still nothing. Healy gets to his feet and peeks
into the kitchen. When he turns his back, we see PUFFY IGNITE IN
FLAMES.

When Healy turns back, he's horrified at what he sees. He grabs a
vase of flowers and POURS THE WATER ON THE BURNING DOG.

With this, Puffy flinches and comes to, GASPING FOR AIR!

                        MAGDA
           All I had was some Funny Bones--how does
           that sound, honey?

Healy picks up the stunned pooch and swaddles it in a blanket as
Magda ENTERS the room followed by Mary.

                        HEALY
                 (petting dog)
           Fine. Fine.

                        MARY
           Here you go.
                 (sniffs)
           What's that smell?

Mary hands Healy his vodka and as he downs it, we

courtyard area by the main building.

           dinner?

                        MARY
           We will, but first I have a surprise.

                        HEALY
           A surprise?

                        MARY
           The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker
           is going to be here. He's an architect,
           too. You guys will have tons to talk about.

CLOSE ON HEALY'S FACE as he starts to panic.

INT. ARCHITECTURE EXHIBIT

Mary and Healy walk through the exhibit area. Mary scans the room
for her friend. Healy's face is ashen.

                        MARY
           I know he's around here someplace.

                        HEALY
                 (chipper)
           What say we get outta here and go crush a
           bucket?

                        MARY
           We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't
           this stuff great?

Mary points to an architectural model.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Is this one art deco or art nouveau?

                        HEALY
           Deco.

                        MARY
           Would you call that a portico or a
           vestibule?

                        HEALY
           That...? Vestibule.

                        MARY
           How about--?

                        HEALY
           When you look at architecture, try not to
           concern yourself with the pieces--look at
           the building in its totalitarianism.

Mary gives him a look. Suddenly, Healy draws a couple of invisible
sixshooters at her.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Stone crab time! Come on, let's get outta
           here, goofy.

He turns to go but Mary notices something O.S.

                        MARY
           Tucker!

Mary leads Healy over to her friend TUCKER, a
distinguished-looking man in his fifties. Healy looks like a dog
that's being dragged to the vet. Mary and Tucker embrace.

                        TUCKER
                 (still hugging)
           Come on, like you mean it.

Mary LAUGHS and hugs Tucker tighter. Then:

                        MARY
           Tucker, this is my friend Pat Healy.
           Healy and Tucker shake hands.

                        TUCKER
           Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.

                        HEALY
                 (keeping cool)
           Mainly I work out of Boston. 

                        TUCKER
           Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up
           there?

                        HEALY
           Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.

                        TUCKER
           Harvard?

                        HEALY
           You bet.

                        TUCKER
                 (pleased)
           Did you study under Kim Greene?

                        HEALY 
           Among others.

                        TUCKER
           Kim and I are close friends!

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.

                        TUCKER
           You mean him.

BEAT.

                        HEALY
           Well...that's debatable.

Healy makes a hand-gesture to imply that Kim's sexuality is in
doubt.

                        TUCKER
           Really? But he's been married for twenty
           years--they've got six kids.

                        HEALY
           Nice smokescreen, isn't it?

Tucker can hardly believe his ears.

                        MARY
           Pat does projects all over the world.

                        TUCKER
                 (impressed)
           Where would I have seen your work?

                        HEALY
           Have you been to
                 (thinking hard)
           Let's see--Santiago, Chile?

                        TUCKER
           Absolutely! I was there twice last year.
           Which building is yours?

                        HEALY
           Do you know the...soccer stadium?

                        TUCKER
           Did you build the Estadio Olympico?

                        HEALY
           No...just down the street, the Amigo Tower.

                        TUCKER
           I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What
           style?

                        HEALY
           Uh, sort of nouveau deco...with a big
           vestibule. Check it out next time you're up
           there.

Tucker starts to look a little suspicious.

                        TUCKER
           You know, I really should take your card.

                        HEALY
                 (noticing something)
           Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a
           minute, Tucker?

Healy drags Mary across the room toward a MAN who's looking at an
exhibit.

                        HEALY
                 (to Man)
           Dooby, you old sheep-fucker! How the hell
           are ya?

                        MAN
           My name's Mel.

                        HEALY
           Oh, sorry. Anyone ever tell you you look
           just like Jim Dubois?

                        MAN
           The sheepfucker?

Healy shrugs and the man walks away angrily.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

A two-door Toyota Tercel flies by the camera.

INT. TOYOTA TERCEL

A determined Ted is cruising along the highway in his rent-a-car.
He has a cup of coffee in his hand and a HITCHHIKER in the seat
beside him. The Hitchhiker sits with a LARGE RED DUFFEL BAG
between his legs.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Thanks for picking me up. 

                        TED
           No prob, I could use the company. I've been
           on the road going on fifteen hours
           straight.

                        HITCHHIKER
           I know how you feel--I been standing in the
           same spot for the last five hours. You know
           it's against the law to pick up a
           hitchhiker in this state.

                        TED
           That must make it tough.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Sucks. So what's up? You some kind of
           salesman or something?

                        TED
           Nah. I'm...I'm nothing.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Oh. Well I am.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        HITCHHIKER
           A salesman--that's what I am. I mean, I'm
           gonna be anyway. I'm starting my own
           company--video sales--just as soon as I get
           enough seed money.

                        TED
           'That right? Good for you.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Yeah, you wouldn't believe my idea--it's a
           home run. You ever hear of Eight-Minute
           Abs?

                        TED
           The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on
           T.V.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Two million copies it sold last year. Two
           million, man. But not next year--my idea's
           gonna blow them outta the water. Get this:
                 (dramatic pause)
           Seven-Minute Abs.

BEAT.

                        TED
           I see where you're going.

                        HITCHHIKER
                 (big smile)
           Think about it. You walk into a video
           store and you see Eight-Minute Abs and
           right next to it you see Seven-Minute
           Abs--which one you gonna spring for?

                        TED
           I'd go with the seven.

                        HITCHHIKER
           Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll
           get every bit as good a work-out.

                        TED
           How do you guarantee that?

                        HITCHHIKER
           Well it's the company motto: 'If you ain't
           happy we'll send you the extra minute.'

                        TED
           Huh. That sounds great.
                 (beat)
           Unless someone else comes out with
           Six-Minute Abs.

Ted CHUCKLES, but the Hitchhiker just GLARES at him, unamused.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (unaware)
           I'm gonna pull over. I gotta take a leak.

EXT. REST AREA - NIGHT

The Toyota Tercel pulls in and parks. Ted gets out and walks into
the bushes to whiz.

ON TED - as he steps into the dark brush UNZIPPING his fly he
TRIPS over something and FALLS TO THE GROUND.

                        TED
           What the--?

Suddenly WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH--several huge SPOTLIGHTS
illuminate the area revealing

TWO DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEN scurrying to pull their pants up all
around him.

                        POLICE OFFICER (O.S.)
           THIS IS A RAID!

ANGLE ON a startled Ted ON HIS KNEES directly in front of
ANOTHER MAN, making it appear that he's been BLOWING THE GUY.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals a DOZEN POLICE OFFICERS holding the
spotlights and moving in for the arrests followed by a CAMERA
CREW.

                        TED
                 (deer caught in headlights)
           Wait a second, it's not what you think.

A GUY with his pants at his ankles jumps on the bandwagon.

                        PANTS AT ANKLES GUY
           That's right! I-I-I was just pissing!

Ted glares at him.

                        TED
           No! I was pissing!

                        POLICE OFFICER
           Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in
           the truck.

As they grab Ted and the others and hustle them away, we

PAN TO the Hitchhiker sitting in the Toyota watching the raid
unfold.

The Hitchhiker is clearly PANICKY at the sight of all the cops.

Quietly he OPENS THE CAR DOOR, ducks down, and then SPRINTS AWAY
INTO THE WOODS UNSEEN, LEAVING HIS BIG RED BAG BEHIND.

                                                       CUT TO:

                 (to Cop)
           Okay, take it easy, you don't have to push.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - NIGHT

Healy and Mary are walking home at the end of their date. Healy is
eating a big, wild cone of COTTON CANDY and drinking a beer.

                        HEALY
           That grandmother of yours--she's really
           something.

                        MARY
           Magda? She's not my grandmother--actually
           she rents the apartment right next to mine.
           Her husband passed away a couple years ago
           so she doesn't like to be alone.

                        HEALY
           And it doesn't cramp your style?

                    MARY
               Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.

                        HEALY
           Lint?

                        MARY
           Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running
           around on the rug all day--just makes for a
           lot of lint. Look at this...

Mary lifts her shirt, revealing a BIG CLUMP OF COTTON CANDY
STICKING OUT OF HER BELLY-BUTTON.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           See? That's just one day.

Healy CRACKS UP and then gazes at her. What a babe.

                        HEALY
           You know, sometimes I wish I could be like
           Magda and not go home. I'd like to just
           bounce around for awhile, do a little
           traveling...

                        MARY
           Why bounce when you have your own condo in
           Nepal to go to?

It's clear Healy forgot about that one.

                        HEALY
           Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new
           place, quit the architect game, slow things
           down, read more books, see more movies...

                        MARY
           You're a movie buff?

                        HEALY
           Try to be. It's tough going with the crap
           they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the
           best they've got to offer I say thanks but
           no thanks.

                        MARY
           Have you seen it?

                        HEALY
           No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr
           hated it.

                        MARY
           A fucking moron.

                        HEALY
           Huh. I guess I just wish they made them
           like they used to. You know, something like
           The Heartbreak Kid...or Harold and
           Maude.

Mary can't believe her ears.

                        MARY
           Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite
           movie.

                        HEALY
           Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know
           it's corny, but I do love it.

                        MARY
           Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's
           the greatest--

                        HEALY
           --Love story of our time.

Mary smiles. Is this guy for real?

                        MARY
           Yeah.

                        HEALY
           Wow. I thought I was the only one.

They come to her apartment building and stop. It gets a little
awkward.

                        MARY
           So...

                        HEALY
           Yeah...I guess this is it, huh?

                        MARY
           I guess.

                        HEALY
           Well, I'll see ya.

Healy turns to go but stops.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Mary ah, forget it.

                        MARY
           What?

                        HEALY
           No, forget it, it was stupid.

                        MARY
           Come on, what were you going to say?

                        HEALY
           Nah, really, it was moronic.

She grabs him by the shirt playfully.

                        MARY
           Just say it.

Healy takes a deep breath.

                        HEALY
           Could I feel your bosoms before I go?

Mary just stares at him.

                        MARY (beat)
           Knock yourself out.

Healy reaches out and cups her breasts. He doesn't kiss her, she
doesn't kiss him, he just fondles her breasts. Then:

                        HEALY
           Okey-dokey, so tomorrow night?

She smiles and as Healy walks away we

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

Ted is sitting alone at a table in a small interrogation room.

PULLBACK to reveal that he is being observed through a two-way
mirror by two detectives, FRANEK and CAVALLO.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Man, they never look like you'd expect.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           That's probably how he got the victim to
           drop his guard. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Where'd they find the body?

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           In a big red bag on the front passenger
           seat. All hacked up--fucking gruesome--a
           real psycho, this one.

The Detectives ENTER the room.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

Ted stands as the Detectives take a seat across from him.

                        TED
                 (agitated)
           I'm telling you, I did not solicit sex! I
           was just stopping to go the bathroom, next
           thing I know I tripped over something--well
           someone--and, POOF, there's cops and
           lights and--

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           Okay, calm down, Ted, we believe you.
                 (beat)
           The problem is we found your friend in
           the car.

As Ted sits back down the Detectives just stare at him. Finally
Ted thinks he gets it.

                        TED
           Oh. The hitchhiker.
                 (CHUCKLES)
           That's what this is all about.

Ted puts his head in his hands and smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Isn't that just my luck--I get caught for
           everything.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           So you admit it?

                        TED
           Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games
           with you. I could give you a song and dance
           but what's the point? I did it and we all
           know it.
                 (laughs)
           The hitcher himself told me it's
           illegal The irony.

The Detectives are surprised by his forthrightness.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           Well, uh, can you tell us his name?

                        TED
           Jeez, I didn't catch it.

The Detectives flinch at his glib demeanor.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           So he was a stranger? It was totally
           random?

                        TED
                 (confused)
           He was the first hitcher I saw, what can I
           tell you? Now cut to the chase, how much
           trouble am I in? 

The Detectives look at one another. 

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           First tell us why you did it.

                        TED
           Why I did it?
                 (scoffs)
           I don't know. Boredom? I thought I was
           doing the guy a favor.

The Detectives look at each other.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           This wasn't your first time, was it, Ted?
           How many we talking?

                        TED
           Hitchhikers? I don't know--fifty...a
           hundred maybe--Who keeps track?

Finally Detective Cavallo EXPLODES across the table and starts
WAILING on a shocked Ted.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           You sonofabitch! You're gonna fry!!!!

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary pulls up in her Honda Civic. She parks out front and enters
the building.

PAN ACROSS THE STREET TO REVEAL - Healy is parked in his car.
His surveillance equipment is pointed toward Mary's office.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - MORNING

Mary walks into the office and sees a MEDICAL ASSISTANT standing
near the coffee maker.

                        MARY
           Mornin', Jane.

                        MEDICAL ASSISTANT #1
           Good morning, Doctor. Your friend Tucker's
           in your office to see you. 

Mary nods and heads toward her office. 

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

Mary walks into her office and sees Tucker seated at her desk.
(SHOT FROM behind Tucker so we only see the back of his head.)

                        TUCKER
           What's up, Doc?

                        MARY
           Tucker, you look different some how. Did
           you do something with your hair?

MARY'S POV - Tucker's got two TONGUE DEPRESSORS under his upper
lip making him look like a walrus.

                        TUCKER
           The teeth, the teeth. I got 'em capped.

ON MARY - smiles.

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, they look great.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

He's got his listening gun fixed on Mary's office.

                        TUCKER (V.O.)
           You don't think they're too big?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           No no, the bigger the better.
                 (beat)
           But I must say, they could be a little
           brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful
           of pearly whites.

Healy looks at his teeth in the mirror. Not exactly pearly.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker pulls the tongue depressors out of his teeth and laughs. He
stands up, and when Mary tries to squeeze past him he gives her a
kiss on the cheek.

                        TUCKER
           You ever been laid in this office?

Mary pushes past him.

                        MARY
           Behave yourself, Tucker.
                 (smiles)
           Come on, what are you doing here?

She sits in her chair and leans against her desk.

                        TUCKER
           I wanted to talk to you about your friend
           Patrick.

EXT. HEALY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Healy almost flies out of his seat.

                        MARY (O.S.)
           He's a nice guy, isn't he?

                        TUCKER (O.S.)
           Well that's what I'm trying to figure
           out. How long have you known him?

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tucker has a look of concern.

                        MARY
           Not long at all, but I really like him.
                 (off Tucker's look)
           Okay, I know he's a little different,
           Tucker, but that's what I like about him.
           He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a
           dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always
           politically correct and he probably farts,
           too. And that's okay with me.

                        TUCKER
           That's what you've been looking for--a
           farter?

                        MARY
           I've been looking for a guy--not one of
           these South Beach pussies.

                        TUCKER
                 (SIGHS)
           Look, it's just that something about him
           struck me as odd last night. He gave me
           this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some
           friends back east. They don't know of any
           architect named Patrick Healy and he's not
           listed as a Harvard alumnus.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - SAME

Healy SLAMS his hand on the steering wheel.

                        HEALY
           Fuck!!

                        MARY (O.S.)
           Huh...that's strange.

INT. MARY'S OFFICE - SAME

                        TUCKER
           I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't
           think I'm being meddlesome. I just think
           you should be careful with this guy.

                        MARY
                 (concerned)
           No no no, Tucker, thank you.

                        TUCKER
           I mean let's face it, Mary, you're
           beautiful, you've got money, you trust
           people--I'm just saying, there's a lot of
           psychos out there.

                        MARY
                 (small smile)
           I appreciate you looking out for me.

INT. SOUTH CAROLINA PRISON - DAY

CLOSE ON - Detective Franek as he SPEAKS, sheepishly. His
remorseful- looking partner Cavallo stands behind him.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           On behalf of the entire South Carolina law
           enforcement community, I would like to
           offer our heartfelt apologies for any pain
           or temporary inconvenience we may have
           caused you, Mr. Peloquin.

REVERSE ANGLE - reveals that Ted is lying on his prison bed
being spooned by a 300-pound SLEEPING INMATE.

INT. PRISON HALLWAY

The two Detectives and an apoplectic Ted walk down the hallway.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           At exactly 10:48 this morning a man was
           apprehended not far from where you were
           arrested. He was identified as an escaped
           mental patient and subsequently confessed
           to the murder that you were being held for.
           Lab tests confirmed a fingerprint match on
           the bag.

                        TED
                 (fragile)
           So...I'm free to go?

Detective Cavallo stops and holds out his hand.

                        DETECTIVE CAVALLO
           No harm, no foul?

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           I guess.

Still traumatized, Ted shakes the man's hand, then mopes toward
the door.

                        DETECTIVE FRANEK
           By the way, there's somebody here to see
           you.

INT. TED'S CAR - DAY

Dom is driving; a bruised and somber Ted is in the passenger seat.

                        DOM
           You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know
           that?

                        TED
           I am?

                        DOM
           Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just
           about to cut your throat when you stopped
           to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe
           up your ass, man.

                        TED
           Yeah feels like it.

Ted grimaces and shifts in his seat.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How the hell did you get here anyway?

                        DOM
           Flew.
                 (beat)
           Told my wife I was going to a Promise
           Keepers convention.

Ted gives him a look.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           I hate to ruin your day, Ted, but I have
           some bad news for you.

Ted SIGHS.

                        TED
                 (resigned)
           Shoot.

                        DOM
           Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't
           know where to mail his last paycheck so I
           sent my assistant by his mother's
           apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic
           mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten
           years.

                        TED
           And this adversely affects me how...?

                        DOM
           Don't you see?--Healy lied to us about
           everything! The landlord said when he got
           back from Miami he kept talking about
           falling for some doctor named Mary!

Ted is stunned.

                        TED
           Huh? What? No...My Mary? Mary wouldn't go
           for him....would she?

Dom hands Ted a SLIP OF PAPER.

                        DOM
           His address in Miami. You know, when you
           think about it, we really don't know the
           first thing about this guy.

Finally the implications of this dawn on Ted.

                        TED
           Jesus Christ what have I done?

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - EVENING

A confused Mary and her girlfriends are in the apartment while
Magda listens to the radio scanner in the b.g.

                        LISA
           You're not seriously thinking about going
           out with this guy again?

                        JOANNIE
           Mary, he sounds like a psycho!

                        MAGDA
           Would you hens quit ya cackling and let her
           do what she wants to do. Puffy liked him
           and Puffy's never wrong.

The girlfriends roll their eyes.

                        BRENDA
           Mary, the guy's full of shit.

                        MARY
           What if he's not? What if Tucker just made
           an honest mistake?

                        LISA
           What if he didn't?

It's clear that Mary is torn.

                        MARY
           I don't know how I can bail now, he's going
           to be here any minute.

                        JOANNIE
           Well then blow him off when he gets here.

                        MARY
           But you didn't meet him. He seems so I
           don't know...perfect...kind of.

                        BRENDA
           He has a big cock, doesn't he?

Mary shoots Brenda a look. 

                        MAGDA
           Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name
           was?

                        MARY
           Healy.

Magda's eyes almost come out of her head.

                        MAGDA
           I think you better listen to this.

Magda turns up the volume on her scanner and we can clearly hear
Healy TALKING ON HIS CELLULAR PHONE. Mary and her girlfriends
gather around.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           So where the hell are you, Healy?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary
           girl I told you about.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           The sawbones?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Yep.

The girls all look at one another.

                        BRENDA
           We hit the motherlode.

                        MARY
           We shouldn't be listening to this.

                        LISA AND JOANNIE
           Shhh.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           She still think you're a fucking architect?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Oh yeah.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Dumbshit.

                        LISA
           Mr. Perfect, huh?

Mary starts to feel like a fool.

                        MARY
                 (edgy)
           Turn it up, Magda.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Hey, watch your mouth--she's a great gal.
           I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           I don't know. I guess...it just seems that
           women today are more impressed by the
           mighty buck than by some schmo who spent
           the last seventeen years scraping by on
           Peace Corp wages.

The girls all seem moved by this.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

Healy is parked out front, the phone in one hand, a SCRIPT in the
other, as he listens to Sully read the following words:

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you
           say, she's going to want to hear about
           the things you did. 

                        HEALY
                 (dismissing this)
           Ahh.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - SAME

A disheveled and wired-looking Sully is sitting on the couch in
his underwear READING FROM THE SAME SCRIPT. There's COKE on the
table, DOG SHIT on the floor, and FLIES everywhere.

In the B.G. we see the Great Dane SNIFFING at his empty bowl and
the Boa Constrictor sprawled out on the floor, barely moving.

                        SULLY
                 (reading)
           Come on, you could tell her about the
           irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan, the
           orphan babies who cried in your arms in
           Romania...
                 (does a line of blow)
           ...the hope you gave Freddie the leper in
           Calcutta...

Suddenly the dog snatches the page out of his hand and STARTS TO
EAT IT.

BACK ON Mary and friends.

                        JOANNIE
                 (welling up)
           I love this man.

Magda folds her arms and gloats.

INT. HEALY'S CAR - NIGHT

                        HEALY
           Look, I did all those things for myself.
           I'll be honest with you, I'm a selfish
           prick. I get a high from helping all of
           God's creatures. An honest to goodness
           high.

Just then, Healy sees a bug on the car window and instinctively
squashes it.

ON SULLY - he has the phone wedged between his cheek and
shoulder as he STRUGGLES with the dog to get the script.

Sully still can't retrieve the script, nor his next line.

                        SULLY
                 (winging it)
           That's bullshit, man you, uh, you were on
           the front line. Remember the, uh,
           malaria the, uh, typhoon fever that
           vicious strain of genital herpes?

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - they flinch at this.

ON HEALY - he stares at the phone, horrified.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           Uh, sure. I cured a lot of nasty
           illnesses in third-world countries.

ON MARY AND FRIENDS - as they let out a sigh.

                        HEALY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my
           philanthropy as some form of
           currency...especially after what I did.
                 (SIGHS)
           I lied to this poor girl. Lied. man. She
           deserved better.

                        SULLY (V.O.)
           Hey, love will make you do fucked-up
           things.

                        HEALY (V.O.)
           You said it, mister.
                 (choking up)
           I gotta go.

ON SULLY - as he HANGS UP the phone and does another line, we

PAN TO the Great Dane Hal as he looks around for something,
anything to eat. He SNIFFS at a sock, then a beer bottle, before
finally setting his sights on the Boa Constrictor Bill. Bill
glances the dog's way nervously, SENSES TROUBLE, and wiggles his
way into another room. As Hal TAKES OFF after the snake, we

Healy starts to knock on Mary's door, but, before he can, the door

           Oh Mary. Look, there's something I have
           to tell you. I'm not

Before he can finish, Mary steps forward and their mouths meet in

and gives Warren a vicious STRAIGHT-ARM. When Healy gets into the
end zone he spikes the ball and starts talking trash to another
defender.

--Healy shows up at Mary's door sporting a set of OVERSIZED
INCREDIBLY-WHITE CAPPED TEETH. He gives her a big horse smile and
she reacts uncertainly.

--Healy is in Mary's apartment as Mary finishes dressing for a
night on the town.

                        MARY
           All set.

                        HEALY
           You look great.
                 (beat)
           Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of
           these pants?

When she puts her head close to inspect his pants, he lets fly a
THUNDEROUS FART. She pulls her head away, repulsed, but Healy just
LAUGHS.

--Mary and and the horse-toothed Healy are having dinner in a
romantic restaurant. As he eats he tells an animated story but
he's having trouble with the new choppers and chunks of food are
spraying out of his mouth with every word. Mary has to BOB AND
WEAVE to avoid being covered with debris.

--Healy and Warren are playing monopoly. When Warren isn't
looking, Healy cheats and puts a couple hotels on Boardwalk. In
the b.g. we see one of Warren's buddies fall out of a palm tree.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

A lovesick Healy is mauling Mary out on the sidewalk in front
while Warren stands off to the side LISTENING TO A WALKMAN.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals a devastated Ted and Dom watching this
from Ted's car.

                        TED
           Fuck me.
                 (sighs)
           Let's go home.

                        DOM
           No! You've gone through way too much to
           back down now. Get over there and do
           something--I can't stand watching this.

BACK ON MARY AND HEALY as Healy starts OVER-DOING IT and Mary
has to break it off.

                        MARY
           Whoa, whoa, how's my stomach taste?

Healy LAUGHS.

                        HEALY
           How's my stomach taste, she says.
                 (shakes head)
           Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab,
           Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like
           a dog.

                        MARY
           Forget it. It was...fun.

ON TED AND DOM 
Ted recognizes Warren.

                        TED
           Holy shit, there's Warren.

BACK ON MARY. HEALY, AND WARREN 
Suddenly we see Warren PERK UP at something.

                        WARREN
           Franks and beans!

ON TED AND DOM 
                        TED
           Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.

They both duck down in their seats.

BACK ON MARY. HEALY. AND WARREN 
                        WARREN
           Beans and franks.

                        MARY
           Give it a rest, War. You just ate.

                        HEALY
           Aw, leave him alone, he's just got a big
           appetite.
                 (to Warren)
           Am I right?

Healy winks at Mary.

                        WARREN
           Huh?

Healy reaches over and lifts a headphone off Warren's ear.

                        HEALY
           I said you've got a big app--

Suddenly Warren SUCKER-PUNCHES HEALY IN THE THROAT.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           Urrggghh...

                        MARY
           Warren!

ON TED AND DOM - as they flinch.

                        DOM
           Attaboy!

BACK ON MARY et al - Healy holds his throat, clearly in pain.

                        MARY
           Are you okay?

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (raspy, to Mary)
           Not to worry. So...see you tonight,
           right? Right?

                        MARY
                 (cornered)
           Sure.

Mary watches with a look of concern as Healy gets in his car and
drives off.

ON TED AND DOM 
Ted stares gazily.

                        DOM
           Well? What are you waiting for?

                        TED
           I don't know what to say.

                        DOM
           Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the
           schmuck out of the water.

                        TED
           Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on
           her. She's gonna be fucking pissed.
                 (stares at Mary)
           She's even more beautiful than I remember.

THEIR POV - Mary and Warren start to go in the apartment.

                        DOM
           Get over there, you pussy! She's leaving!

Suddenly Dom HONKS THE HORN, then ducks down. Mary turns around
and sees Ted.

                        TED
           You asshole, what are you--
                 (CALLING OUT CHEERILY)
           Mary! Is that you?

                        MARY
                 (squinting)
           Who's that?

Ted gets out of the car and hustles across the street toward Mary.

                        TED
           It is you! It's me...Ted. From Rhode
           Island Ted.

Finally she recognizes him.

                        MARY
           Oh my God...Ted.
                 (big smile)
           What are you...? I can't believe this. I
           haven't seen you since-- 

                        TED
           Yup, that's right. Junior prom...kinda.

                        MARY
           And did everything--?

                        TED
           Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.

Mary LAUGHS.

                        TED (cont'd)
           How are you doing, Warren?

                        WARREN
           Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?

                        TED
           I'm gonna take a rain check.

Mary is stunned.

                        MARY
           I can't believe he remembered you. He never
           remembers anybody.
                 (beat)
           You know I tried to call you for weeks
           after that.

                        TED
           Really? I never got a message.

                        MARY
           That's weird. I talked to your brother
           Jimmy five or six times.

Ted is devastated to hear this.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           By the way, how's he doing?

                        TED
           He's dead.

                        MARY
                 (taken aback)
           Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.

                        TED
                 (bitter)
           No, it was a good thing.
                 (off her look)
           I mean, good in that it was very quick.

Ted pantomimes an explosion.

                        MARY
           Oh. So...what brings you down here?

                        TED
           Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of
           mine decided to...ah...you know...just
           ...drive down.

She stares at him.

                        MARY
           Well you look great. Are you married, do
           you have kids?

                        TED
           Nope, nope--dodged a few bullets.
                 (smiles)
           God, I cannot believe I'm standing here
           with Mary Jenson.

                        MARY
           Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.

                        TED
                 (taken aback)
           Oh...are you...?

                        MARY
           Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.
                 (off his look)
           There was this guy back in college who was
           bothering me...got kind of ugly--a
           restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway,
           when I got out of Princeton I changed my
           name as a precaution.

                        TED
           Jeez...that sounds awful. Hey, what do you
           say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up
           on old times?

BEAT.

                        MARY
           Didn't we just do that?

Ted doesn't know how to respond to this and then she smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but
           the thing is I already have plans. How
           about tomorrow night?

                        TED
           Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve
           years.
                 (beat)
           Don't make me wait another day.

Mary seems touched by this.

                        MARY
           Tell me where you're staying. I'll pick you
           up at eight.

Ted finally smiles and we

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - TWILIGHT

A content Healy is parked out front of Mary's apartment, absently
listening to her spill her guts to Magda while he reads the
newspaper.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           I'm buying bananas tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Why?

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Back when I was your age I always used to
           make myself a big banana split after sex. I
           think you're gonna need one tonight.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll
           probably need it before I will.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

Mary is skipping around the apartment while Magda sits on the
couch.

                        MAGDA
           Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap
           smear the guy needed leather gloves and an
           oyster shucker.

                        MARY
           So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to
           take you to the movies.

                        MAGDA
           Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're
           in love doesn't mean everyone else has to
           be.

                        MARY
           Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.

                        MAGDA
           Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this
           since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.

BACK ON HEALY - he's reveling in it all.

                        MARY (V.O. )
           Well I am pretty psyched. I ran into a
           guy today I hadn't seen since high school.

Healy loses the smile and sits up.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           An old flame?

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Kind of. Ted Peloquin--one of the sweetest
           guys in the world.

Healy TURNS UP THE VOLUME.

ON MARY 
                        MARY (cont'd)
           He was so shy and clumsy...I had a major
           crush on him.

BACK ON HEALY as he nearly puts his head through the roof. He
grabs hold of the steering wheel and pounds his head on it.

                        HEALY
           No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

                        MARY (V.O.) (cont'd)
           We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that
           reminds me, I've got to call
           what's-his-face and cancel.

ON MARY 
                        MAGDA
           Do I sense a chill in the air?

Mary sits down.

                        MARY
           Oh, Magda, I let my head get in the way of
           my love life. I always pick guys on what I
           feel in here.
                 (pats heart)
           But with this Pat guy my head kept saying
           "Grow up, Mary. You have a lot in common
           with this one, you'll grow to feel
           something for him." But it never happened.

ON HEALY - he couldn't look more crushed. Suddenly his cellular
phone RINGS. He stares at it for TWO, THREE, FOUR RINGS.
Panic-stricken. Then he answers it.

                        HEALY
                 (jovial voice)
           Hey, Patty-boy here. Sorry I missed ya, but
           I'm out rustling up some champagne and
           roses in preparation for the greatest
           birthday of my life. Hope you and yours are
           having a good day, too.

Healy makes a BEEP sound and then holds his breath.

ON MARY - she stares at the phone, feeling cornered.

                        MARY
           Uh, hi Pat, it's me, Mary. Just wanted to
           say I'm...looking forward to tonight.

She hangs up.

                        MAGDA
           You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at
           night?

                        MARY
           I can't do it--I just found out it's his
           birthday.
                 (sighs)
           I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.

ON HEALY - he blows imaginary smoke off an imaginary gun. Then
he sits back and smugly listens to her DIAL THE PHONE. But then he
hears something that concerns him--a KNOCK on the door and the dog
YAPPING.

ON MARY - she puts down the phone and answers the door. It's
Tucker, the architect.

                        MARY
                 (surprised)
           Tucker...come on in.

BACK ON HEALY pulling his hair out. He's on an emotional roller
coaster heading downhill.

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Well look who's here.

BACK TO MARY'S APARTMENT - Tucker is carrying an unopened BOTTLE
OF SCOTCH and absently flicking the YAPPING pooch off his ankles.

                        TUCKER
           There she is--I brought you a little
           thirst-quencher, Mag.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, you are sweet.

                        TUCKER
           No, I'm not. I just want to get you-drunk
           so you'll pass out and I can have my way
           with Mary.

Everyone LAUGHS.

                        MARY
           Can I pour you one?

                        TUCKER
           Thanks, but I've got to be going.
           Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social
           visit.

Tucker's tone shifts and Mary grows concerned.

                        MARY
           What's up?

                        TUCKER
           Well...I've got a little more news about
           your friend Healy.

Mary seems relieved.

                        MARY
           I know what you're going to say, but he
           already told me everything. I know he's not
           an architect.

Tucker pulls out a piece of paper.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I think you'd better sit down.

                        MARY
           Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this,
           but I'm really strapped for time here and--

                        TUCKER
           Mary, the man's a killer.

ON HEALY - he can't believe his ears.

BACK ON MARY - as she lowers herself onto the couch.

                        MARY
                 (stunned)
           What...?

                        TUCKER
           I've got a friend in the Boston police
           department. He faxed me this this morning.
           I'll just give you the highlights.
                 (reading from rap sheet)
           After a short stint as a petty thief,
           Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery
           by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he
           committed his first murder--a pretty
           teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He
           was incarcerated until age twenty-two when,
           despite a grim psychological profile, the
           state was forced to release him. In his
           mid-twenties and again in his early
           thirties he was suspected of homicides in
           the states of Utah and Washington.
           Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly
           decomposed that there wasn't enough
           evidence to hold him, and on and on and so
           forth and so on.

Mary looks like she's going to throw up.

ON HEALY - he listens intently, his face ashen.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Holy shit...

                        MAGDA (V.O.)
           Puffy, get over here.

We hear the PITTER-PATTER of the dog's nails on the floor, then a
LOUD THUMP followed by a YELP.

ON MARY 
                        MARY
           Magda!

                        MAGDA
           The little shit lied to me about that guy!

Mary picks up the startled dog and pets him.

                        MARY
                 (growing emotional)
           I can't believe this is happening. I'm
           supposed to be meeting him in an hour.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, just calm down. It's going to be
           okay.

Tucker puts his arms around her.

                        MAGDA
           Why you two never hooked up is beyond me.

Mary looks fondly at Tucker.

                        MARY
           Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in
           my life.

                        TUCKER
           Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give
           me a big head.
                 (smiles)
           The important thing, Doctor, is you've got
           to distance yourself as much as possible
           without pissing this psycho off.

                        MARY
           Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to
           do. I'll call him right now.

BACK ON HEALY - he looks stunned. His cellular PHONE RINGS. He
stares at it, then picks it up.

                        HEALY
           Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and
           roses...and I'm really happy. Leave a
           message. BEEP.

                        MARY (V.O.)
                 (nervous)
           Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're
           not going to believe this--well, you'll
           believe it, there's no reason not to--but I
           just got beeped for emergency surgery.
           Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to
           bail on you.

As we hear a CLICK, Healy stares at the cell phone, seething.

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER

Tucker comes out the front door, looks around, then walks off down
the sidewalk.

ANGLE ACROSS THE STREET - on Healy, his steely gaze fixed on
Tucker.

                        HEALY
                 (under breath)
           You're gonna pay, fucker.

Healy discreetly pulls out and slowly follows Tucker in his car.

BACK ON TUCKER - He continues down the sidewalk, looking back
once or twice, apprehensive. He rounds a corner, then stops next
to an OLD FORD PINTO. He looks around nervously again. Then Tucker
DUCKS INTO THE DRIVER'S SEAT and DRIVES OFF. Healy pulls into
traffic and follows.

INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 

Dom's mixing a drink while Ted paces nervously.

                        TED
           Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know
           if I'm ready for this, man.

                        DOM
           Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?

                        TED
                 (pats his back pocket)
           Got cash.

                        DOM
           Car clean? Plenty of gas?

                        TED
           Check.

                        DOM
           Mints?

                        TED
           Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.

Dom nods, satisfied.

                        DOM
           Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just
           clean the pipes and it's a go.

                        TED
           Hm?

                        DOM
           You know, clean the pipes.

                        TED
           Pipes? What are you talking about?

                        DOM
           You jerk off before all big dates, right?
           Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.

Ted just stares at him.

                        DOM (cont'd)
                 (incredulous)
           You don't jerk off before--?! Are you
           crazy?! That's like going out there with a
           loaded gun. No wonder you're nervous!

Ted considers this.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Think about it: After you've had sex with a
           girl and the two of you are laying in bed,
           are you nervous?

                        TED
           No.

Dom shrugs...Duh.

                        DOM
           Why's that?

                        TED
           I'm usually too tired to be.

Dom makes a game-show BUZZER sound.

                        DOM
           Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby
           batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck
           with your head, that stuff will.

                        TED
                 (starting to believe)
           Huh.

                        DOM
           The most honest moment in a man's life is
           the five minutes after he's blown a load.
           That's a medical fact. And it's because
           you're no longer trying to get laid. You're
           actually thinking like a girl. They love
           that.

                        TED
           Jesus Christ you're right.

                        DOM
           You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go
           out with a loaded gun, you empty the
           barrels!

                        TED
                 (shakes his head)
           Holy shit, I've been going out with a
           loaded gun!

           People get hurt that way.

EXT. HOTEL - EVENING

Dom walks out of the lobby just as another cab arrives and Mary
gets out. He sees and her and ducks behind a bush as she walks
past him.

INT. TED'S HOTEL BATHROOM - SAME

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra
ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We
see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes,
he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly
having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to
clean up.

But something's missing: The Load. Ted looks down, checks his
hands, pants, shoes, looks in the sink, finally glances at the
ceiling, with no luck.

The Load IS MISSING!!!!

That's when the doorbell RINGS. Ted couldn't look more HORRIFIED.
As he buckles his pants, he makes a last, panicky reconnaissance
of the area. The doorbell RINGS AGAIN and Ted reluctantly goes to
answer it.

INT. TED'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME

Ted opens the door and Mary is standing there looking as lovely as
ever.

                        TED
           Hey.

                        MARY
           Hi, Ted.

                        TED
           You look great.

                        MARY
           Thanks.

She notices something.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           What's that?

                        TED
           Hm?

                        MARY
           On your ear, you've got something.

MARY'S POV - a HUGE LOAD is hanging off of Ted's earlobe like a
drop earring.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           It looks like a gob of...

Mary leans forward for a closer look. Ted is terrified.

                        MARY (cont'd)
                 (making face)
           Is that....hair gel?

BEAT.

                        TED
           Sure.

                        MARY
           Oh great, I ran out.

Before Ted can stop her, Mary grabs The Load off his ear and WIPES
IT IN HER BANGS.

EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

Healy is still following Tucker in his car. Finally Tucker stops
in front of a lavish Victorian home and gets out carrying a pizza
and wearing a PIZZA DELIVERY HAT.

Healy SCREECHES to a sideways stop, jumps out and POUNCES ON HIM.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You motherfucker, you're a dead man!

Tucker drops the pizza as Healy SLAMS HIM into a tree.

                        TUCKER
                 (cowering)
           Okay, Pat, take it easy--don't do anything
           stupid.

                        HEALY
           Who the fuck do you think you are making up
           that bullshit about me?!

Healy SLAMS HIM AGAINST THE TREE AGAIN.

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa--I don't know what you're talking
           about.

                        HEALY
           Maybe this'll jog your memory.

Healy SLAPS him across the face.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I'll give you a hint--it's got something to
           do with me being a murderer.

Healy raises his arm again and Tucker tries to shield himself.

                        TUCKER
           Okay, okay, I might've gotten some bad
           information.

Healy grabs him by the collar.

                        HEALY
           That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're
           working for him, aren't you, you little
           shit?

                        TUCKER
           Who?

Healy throws Tucker to the ground and takes off his sport coat.

                        HEALY
           This is your last chance, you fuck. Now
           either you come clean or I'm going to kick
           your ass from here to Tallahassee.

Healy grabs Tucker by the hair and cocks his arm.

                        TUCKER
           I LOVE HER, OKAY?!

Tucker suddenly gets emotional. Healy stops and looks at him.

                        HEALY
           You what?

                        TUCKER
           You heard me, goddamnit. I...I love her.

Healy slowly lets go.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I'm a phony--just like you, man.

                        HEALY
           What do you mean?

                        TUCKER
           I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no
           architect. Don't be a putz--who's been to
           Santiago twice in a year?
                 (scoffing)
           Estadio Olimpico--please!

                        HEALY
           But...but you knew people at Harvard.

                        TUCKER
           I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that
           you were a fake and I made up everything
           else.
                 (sighs)
           My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.

                        HEALY
           Bullshit!

Tucker rolls his eyes and pulls out his PIZZA DELIVERY BADGE, with
him pictured beside the name Norman Plante. As Healy let's this

           Community College for a semester and when
           the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I
           hooked up with the Pizza Barn.

           And you met Mary how?

                        TUCKER
           Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her
           one night and she answered the door in her
           nightgown--that was it for me. I went home
           that night, shaved my beard, and a week
           later I was laid out in her office with a
           broken back.

                        TED
                 (pleased)
           Yeah?

                        MARY
           We've got a lot in common.

Ted takes a chance.

                        TED
           Well...why don't you move back?

                        MARY
           Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my
           practice, the people I work with, Warren's
           got a nice thing going
                 (joking)
           Why don't you just move down here and marry
           me?

Mary smiles and Ted LAUGHS...perhaps a little too hard.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Ted and Mary are sitting on her front stoop SMOKING A BONE.

                        MARY
           So you're a writer?

                        TED
           Trying to be.

                        MARY
           Well good for you. I bet it works out for
           you.

                        TED
           We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at
           least I gave it a shot.

                        MARY
           That's right. And the good thing is you can
           do it anywhere.

                        TED
           What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you
           manage to stay single?

                        MARY
           I don't know...My friends think I'm too
           picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I
           did come close once--just last year, in
           fact. There was this guy he lived in San
           Francisco.

ANGLE ON the corner of building. We see Healy and Tucker SPYING
ON THEM from the shadows.

                        TUCKER
                 (WHISPERING)
           That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!

                        HEALY
           Fucking sickening.

Healy and Tucker duck back into the alley.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - NIGHT

Healy is throwing DOGGIE TREATS through an open THIRD-FLOOR
WINDOW.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

We hear the TELEVISION and see Magda DOZING on the couch with a
watery COCKTAIL IN HER HAND and the dog Puffy at her feet.

Suddenly a DOGGIE TREAT flies through the window, landing on the
rug. Puffy SNAPS TO ATTENTION and approaches the treat. He sniffs
it, then GOBBLES IT UP. ANOTHER doggie treat lands beside him and
he eats that, too. Then ANOTHER.

EXT. MARY'S ALLEY - SAME

Tucker keeps throwing the treats up and Healy looks concerned.

                        HEALY
           How many is that?

                        TUCKER
           Four.

                        HEALY
           That seems like a lot of speed for a little
           pooch--you sure it won't kill him?

                        TUCKER
           I never said that.

As Tucker throws another...

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - SAME

The doggie treat LANDS IN MAGDA'S COCKTAIL, waking her up. Magda
looks around, gets her bearings, and then DOWNS THE DRINK!

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME

Mary and Ted, still sitting on the stoop. Mary seems a little
reflective.

                        MARY
           ... and then it was all over.
                 (SIGHS)
           We haven't spoken since.

                        TED
                 (sincere)
           Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost
           perfect.

                        MARY
           Yeah...almost.
                 (beat)
           You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?

                        TED
           Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while
           I'm ahead.

Mary looks a little disappointed.

                        MARY
           Ted...you're not that far ahead.

                        TED
           Look, Mary, the truth is...I'll be in town
           for a while now but I don't think we should
           see each other for a few weeks.

                        MARY
                 (alarmed)
           Why not?

                        TED
           Well...to be honest....I'm really crazy
           about you and it's making me nervous and
           when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm
           afraid I'm going to doing something really
           dumb before we get started so I think I
           should just lay back until I regain my
           composure.

Mary sort of smiles.

                        MARY
           That's really sweet, Ted, but you should
           save it for one of your books.

                        TED
           All right, let's go.

Ted jumps up and starts up the stairs two at a time.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As Ted and Mary ENTER, we see Magda HOLDING UP THE COUCH with one
hand and VACUUMING WITH THE OTHER.

Mary doesn't know what to make of it.

                        MARY
           Magda, what are you doing?

Magda turns off the vacuum and we hear a BANGING SOUND coupled
with the O.S. MUFFLED YAPPING of Puffy.

                        MAGDA
           Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.

                        MARY
           Where's Puffy?

                        MAGDA
           Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the
           bathroom.

As the O.S. YAPPING AND BANGING continues, Magda PICKS UP THE
TELEVISION and starts DUSTING the TV stand.

                        MARY
                 (to Ted, concerned)
           Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda--would
           you let the dog out of the bathroom.

                        TED
           Yeah, sure.

Ted walks down the hall, following the YAPPING AND BANGING SOUND
until he comes to the bathroom door. The YAPPING is MUCH LOUDER
now and he NOTICES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM HESITATE.

TED'S POV - the bottom part of the door is being DENTED OUTWARD
from the force of something BATTERING IT FROM WITHIN.

                        TED
                 (CALLING out)
           Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?

                        MARY (O.S.)
                 (CALLING out)
           Toy poodle!

Ted thinks about this, shrugs, and opens the door.

BARING HIS TEETH like a Rottweiler, Puffy SPRINGS at Ted's
jugular!

INT. MARY'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Ted stumbles back into the living room with the hopped-up dog ON
HIS FACE. He KNOCKS OVER A LAMP, tumbles onto the floor, and
fights for his life.

Mary and Magda SCREAM as Ted and Puffy mix it up on the floor. Ted
tries to CRAWL TOWARD THE DOOR but Puffy GRABS THE CUFF OF HIS
PANTS.

DOOR POV of Ted's anguished face as he gets pulled back into the
room.

Ted manages to GET THE DOG IN A HEADLOCK.

                        MAGDA
           Stop it, you're hurting him!

                        TED
                 (out of breath)
           Tell him...to calm down.

Puffy gets a piece of Ted's wrist and Ted SCREAMS and drops him.
Both man and toy poodle SPRING TO THEIR FEET.

They start CIRCLING ONE ANOTHER. Puffy leaps at Ted and Ted SMACKS
HIM into a wall. Unfazed, the dog gets a running start and LEAPS
AT TED'S NECK.

Ted manages to duck and PUFFY FLIES OUT THE OPEN WINDOW!

                                                    DISSOLVE TO:

EXT MIAMI STREET - DAY

MONTAGE OF TED AND MARY FALLING IN LOVE 
--Ted and Warren are at the top of a giant WATER SLIDE
Warren motions that he has decided this is not for him.
Ted shoots him a look that makes Warren feel like a
sissy. Convinced it's not too dangerous, Warren
decides to go for it and Ted follows.

--At the bottom of the slide Ted splashes into the huge
pool of water, laughing, having a blast. Then he looks

around...no sign of Warren. Concerned, Ted dives
underwater and a moment later Resurfaces clutching a
GASPING Warren.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

--Mary pumps Warren's stomach as he coughs water out of
his mouth. Ted looks on sheepishly.

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted and Warren walk down a city sidewalk. As they pass
a shop Warren points to the window excitedly.

THEIR POV

In the window there is a mannequin dressed in a Super-
hero outfit, i.e. a generic superman.

Warren then pulls Ted into the store.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted comes out followed by a beaming Warren dressed in
the Super-Hero outfit. They continue walking again and
a few steps later Warren excitedly points to another
shop window.

THEIR POV

In the window is a mannequin dressed in a cowboy
outfit, i.e. Lone Ranger (hat, badge, holster, chaps,
vest, boots, spurs, etc.)

Again, Warren pulls Ted into the store.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Mary is window shopping with a few bags in hand. She
turns and reacts amused.

HER POV

Warren is now dressed in the cowboy outfit and a
humiliated Ted follows dressed in the loose fitting
Super-hero outfit.

EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted and Mary are walking arm and arm on a SCENIC PIER
where PEOPLE ARE FISHING. Right behind them are Magda
and Herb (the Homeless guy) enjoying one another's
company. Ted is on top of the world, feeling good,
looking good-right up until he gets the HOOK IN HIS
MOUTH. Suddenly he gets YANKED OUT OF FRAME.

EXT. SCENIC PIER - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted is FLOPPING AROUND on the pavement and a FISHERMAN
has his FOOT ON HIS FACE as he STRUGGLES TO REMOVE THE
HOOK. Mary looks on, concerned.

EXT. GROCERY STORE - MIAMI - DAY

--Ted and Mary come out of the grocery store each
HOLDING A COUPLE BAGS. Ted also is CARRYING PUFFY, IN A
BODYCAST. Ted PUTS PUFFY ON THE ROOF, then starts
putting the groceries in the back seat.

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

--Mary pulls her car up in front of her apartment. AS
Ted gets out of the passenger's side, he notices that
PUFFY IS STILL ON THE ROOF. He quickly GRABS PUFFY
before Mary notices.

EXT. BATTING CAGE - MIAMI - DAY

--Warren is futilely taking swings in a BATTING CAGE
while Mary looks on helplessly. Finally Ted goes into
the cage, SIGNALS THE GUY TO STOP THE PITCHING MACHINE,
and MOVES WARREN A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE PLATE.

--A distraught Ted SITS SOMBERLY on a bench. Beside him, Mary
comforts Warren whose LEFT EYE IS BLACK AND BLUE AND COMPLETELY
CLOSED.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Ted shows up at Mary's apartment door carrying a BOUQUET OF
FLOWERS and a BASEBALL. When he KNOCKS, the door opens.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

Ted peeks around the corner and sees a SOMBER Mary sitting on the
couch.

                        TED
                 (chipper)
           Hey.

Mary doesn't look up. Ted ENTERS, revealing his gifts.

                        TED (cont'd)
           The flowers are for you and the ball's for
           Warren. I had a friend of mine Fedex it to
           me--it's signed by Tony Conigliaro.

Mary finally looks up but doesn't smile.

                        MARY
           Did you hire Pat Healy to follow me around?

Ted tries to hide his horror.

                        TED
                 (lamely)
           What do you mean?

Mary picks up a letter off the coffee table and hands it to him.
Ted takes a quick look and then drops it on the table.

                        MARY
           It's not true...right, Ted?

Ted CLEARS HIS THROAT.

                        TED
           Well, funny story there. You see, uh, it
           started out as a uh...yeah...it's true. =

Mary stands up.

                        MARY
           Get out.

                        TED
           Wait, hold on, Mary--it's not as bad as it
           sounds. I certainly didn't know--

                        MARY
           That you put a murderer on my trail?

                        TED
           Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I
           just thought--

                        MARY
           What did you think, Ted? That you could spy
           on me and trick me into thinking you were
           someone I could...really go for?

Mary starts to get emotional.

                        TED
           Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.

                        MARY
           Then what the fuck did you do it for?

                        TED
           I did it because because I'd never
           stopped thinking about you and if I didn't
           find you I knew my life would never be good
           again.

Mary looks away.

                        MARY
                 (softly)
           Please leave.

                        TED
                 (devastated)
           Mary, come on...

                        MARY
           Go!

                        TED
                 (beat)
           Okay.

And so Ted does.

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MARY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted comes out of the building, a broken man. He paces back and
forth on the sidewalk, manic with despair. Then he seems to grow
angry. He rifles through his pockets until he finds a SLIP OF
PAPER.

TED'S POV - the paper reads: 'Healy's Miami address--229 Court
Street, apt. 43.'

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

Ted walks down a rather dark hallway until he comes to apartment
43. He KNOCKS on the door but no one answers. He tries the handle
and THE DOOR OPENS.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 

Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.

REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG
SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across
the carpet.

                        TED
           Hello...?

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks
behind the door.

Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when
they see the MESS.

                        HEALY
           Ho-ly shit.

                        TUCKER
           Hey, this is a pretty nice place.

                        HEALY
           Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!

Again, no answer. Suddenly Ted SLAMS THE DOOR shut and grabs Healy
by the collar.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (alarmed)
           Hey, hey, hey!

                        TED
           Surprised?

                        TUCKER
           Hey, buddy, don't do anything rash now.

                        TED
                 (to Tucker)
           Who the fuck are you?

                        HEALY
           He's in love with Mary, too.

Ted releases Healy and glares at him.

                        TED
           You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?

                        HEALY
                 (righteous)
           What do you mean 'why'?

                        TED
           Answer the question, shitball.

                        TUCKER
           I think everybody could use a drink.

Tucker goes into the kitchen.

                        HEALY
           Look, you asked me to follow your girl
           around, and I did and I started to like
           her, and then I realized I just couldn't in
           good conscience do it.

                        TED
                 (amazed)
           Do what?

                        HEALY
           Turn her over to a stalker.

                        TED
           What?! You're calling me a stalker?

                        HEALY
           That's right--if you weren't you would've
           looked for her yourself!

Suddenly they hear a SOUND and turn to see Bill the Boa slithering
into the room with A HUGE, GREAT-DANE-SIZE LUMP in his midsection.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
                 (sickened)
           Oh Christ...poor dog.

                        TED
           You're a sick man, you know that?

                        HEALY
           Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand
           the fact that it was my turn.

                        TED
           Your turn?

                        HEALY
                 (getting emotional)
           That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's
           the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever
           get the great girl? Give the big pig with
           the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick
           of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was
           time for me...time for me...to be happy.

This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down,
runs his fingers through his hair.

                        TED
           Well you didn't have to blow us both out of
           the water. Jesus Christ, just because she
           found out about you, why'd you have to take
           me down with you?

                        HEALY
           I don't know what you're talking about.

                        TED
           I'm talking about the letter, asshole.

                        HEALY
           What? 

Ted stares at him.

                        TED
           Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a
           letter outlining our deal?

                        HEALY
           Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be
           screwing myself.

The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen
with a drink. They turn their attention to him.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           You little fuck.

                        TUCKER
           What?

                        HEALY
           You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said
           you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck
           you until we had this fuck out of the
           fucking picture.
                 (moves in on Tucker)
           You crossed the line, man.

Tucker backs away nervously. 

                        TUCKER
           Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why
           would I cross the line--what do you think I
           got no pride?

Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.

                        TUCKER (cont'd)
           I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You
           probably did it yourself, you piece of
           shit.

                        HEALY
           Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I
           rat myself out?

                        TUCKER
           Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy
           who's idea of courting is blowing farts in
           the chick's face

                        HEALY
           You were following us?

                        TUCKER
           Don't flatter yourself--I was following
           her, I always do. How the hell you think
           I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?

This gets Ted's attention.

                        TED
           You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff
           about Warren?

                        TUCKER
           Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?
           He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two
           should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't
           for me, she might've married that schmuck!

Ted thinks about this.

                        TED
           The hell with you both--I'm out of here.

Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each
other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom
with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take,
then looks back at the snake.

                        HEALY
                 (sadly)
           Oh...Sully.

                        TUCKER
           Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter,
           and it wasn't me who sent it?

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

CLOSE ON an alarmed Mary.

                        MARY
           Woogie? What are what are you doing here?

REVERSE ANGLE reveals Dom sitting on her bed.

                        DOM
           Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about 
           Ted?

                        MARY
           You sent that?

                        DOM
           Uh-huh. I was worried about you.

                        MARY
           Well...thank you. But...you know you're not
           supposed to be within four hundred yards of
           me.

                        DOM
                 (excited)
           That's what I want to tell ya. I've been
           through two years of extensive
           psychotherapy and you know what? You were
           right--I needed help.

                        MARY
                 (cautious)
           That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're
           better--you seem...good--but...you put me
           through quite an ordeal, you know.

Dom nods aggressively.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           I had to move, go to court, change my last
           name--you stole all my shoes!

Dom stands up.

                        DOM
           Look at me.

Mary turns her head.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on
           God above, on everything that is holy to
           me, I did not steal your shoes.

                        MARY
           Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

                        DOM
           All right, I did, but I was in a weird
           place then.

He approaches her.

                        DOM (cont'd)
           Give me a break, Mare, I was nuts!

Mary backs into the living room.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. HEALY'S CAR - DAY

Healy and Tucker are parked right out front LISTENING TO THIS
CONVERSATION. They seem concerned.

                        MARY (V.O.)
           Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.

                        HEALY
           Who the hell's Woogie?

Tucker just shrugs.

BACK ON Mary and Dom. =~

                        MARY
           I'm asking you to leave.

                        DOM
                 (gentle)
           Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all
           wrong.
                 (beat)
           I'm not leaving...

BACK IN HEALY'S CAR 
                        DOM (cont'd) (V.O.)
           ...Not until I get a little something to
           remember you by.

                        MARY (V. O . )
                 (clearly struggling)
           Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!

Healy and Tucker jump out of the car and RUN INTO THE BUILDING.

                                                       CUT TO:

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY

Healy and Tucker STORM INTO THE ROOM and freeze at what they see.

THEIR POV - Dom is cradling SEVERAL PAIRS OF SHOES in his arms
and trying to crawl to the door while Mary holds him back.

                        MARY
           Stop it!

                        DOM
           Just one pair! You owe me that much, you
           heartless bitch!

Healy and Tucker grab Dom and throw him down on the couch.

                        HEALY
           Dom, you're pathetic, fucking over your
           friend Ted like that.

                        DOM
           What? You fucked him over, too.

                        HEALY
           He's no friend of mine.

Suddenly Magda ENTERS from her bedroom. She's holding a half-eaten
BANANA SPLIT. Herb, the Homeless Man, follows after her, sporting
a Tom Jones and buttoning up his shirt.

                        MAGDA
           What the hell's going on here?

At first no one knows what to say. Then:

                        HEALY
           We're in love with your roommate.

                        MAGDA
           Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm
           gonna pack my bags and go back to my own
           place.

Magda heads back into her bedroom and Herb follows.

                        MARY
           Tucker, where are your crutches?

Tucker is stumped for a second, then:

                        TUCKER
                 (British accent)
           Interesting query, Mary...

Healy slaps Tucker in the back of the head.

                        HEALY
           Shut the fuck up and tell her the truth.

Before he can respond, Ted ENTERS.

                        TUCKER
           Well isn't this nice--now we've got the
           whole gang together.

Ted can hardly believe Dom is there.

                        TED
           Dom? What are you?

                        DOM
           You stole her from me. Now I want her back.

                        MARY
                 (rolling eyes)
           Woogie and I went out for awhile in high
           school.

                        TED
                 (stunned)
           You're Woogie?

                        DOM
           Dom Wooganowski. Duh.

                        TED
           But but you're married. You have kids a
           great wife.

                        DOM
           If you're so happy with them, please, be my
           guest.

                        HEALY
           If I may I have a proposal.

Everyone turns to Healy.

                        HEALY (cont'd)
           I say none of us leave this room until our
           young Mary here stops jerking us around and
           decides once and for all who she wants. Now
           Mary, I know this is difficult but you
           really will be doing them all a favor to
           tell them the truth about us.

                        MARY
           Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're
           a murderer.

Healy glares at Tucker.

                        TUCKER
           Uh, well...not exactly. You see, I
           exaggerated a little there.

                        MARY
           You mean he's not a criminal?

                        HEALY
           God no!
                 (pleased)
           I'm just a pathological liar!

Mary looks at Tucker, confused.

                        MARY
           Tucker...not you, too?

Tucker lowers his head and reluctantly nods.

                        TUCKER
           Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my
           folks.

                        MARY
           Oh Jesus...

Just then the door opens and BRETT FAVRE, the Packers quarterback
ENTERS, with Warren (wearing a walkman) beside him. Everyone is
stunned.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Brett...?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           Hi, Mary.

                        HEALY
           What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

                        BRETT FAVRE
           We're in town to play the Dolphins.

                        TED
           I called him. I told him to pick up Warren
           and get over here.

everyone turns their attention to Ted.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Mary, I found out that your buddy Tucker
           there lied to you about Brett.

Tucker lowers his head.

                        TED (cont'd)
           Brett never said anything bad about Warren.
           He loves Warren...and from what he just
           told me on the phone, he loves you, too.
                 (beat)
           He's the guy you should be with.

                        BRETT FAVRE
           That's right, Mare. And you know I'll
           always be true to you.

                        DOM
           Aw shit, this isn't fair.

Mary manages a smile.

                        TED
                 (to Mary)
           I realized something tonight. I'm no better
           than any of these guys. None of them really
           love you...they just fixated on you because
           of how you made them feel. But that's not
           real love...Thank you for letting me see
           that. Now I can get on with the rest of my
           life.

Tucker, Healy, and Dom scoff.

                        TUCKER
           Oh please...

                        DOM
           Don't listen to him, Mary. It's a ploy.

                        HEALY
           You are so full of shit, Strohman. Are you
           going to stand here and tell us that you
           aren't in love with this girl?

Ted looks into Mary's eyes. She looks vulnerable.

                        TED
           Yeah...that's what I'm telling you.
                 (winks)
           See you, Mare.

Ted looks Mary in the eye, then starts for the door.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (as he passes Warren)
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Huh...?

Ted lifts the earphones off Warren's ear.

                        TED
           See you, Warren.

                        WARREN
           Bye, Ted.

Ted then WALKS OUT OF THE ROOM. They all stand there in silence
for a moment, then Dom turns to Brett Favre.

                        DOM
           Hey, Brett, any chance I can get you to
           autograph one of these pumps for me?

                                                       CUT TO:

EXT. MIAMI STREET - DAY

Ted is walking down the street BLUBBERING LIKE A SCHOOLGIRL.
Everyone he passes stares at him. Suddenly Mary comes running down
the OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

                        MARY
           Ted!

Ted stops and looks across the street at her. He wipes his eyes,
hopeful.

                        TED
           What what are you doing here?

                        MARY
           You forgot your keys!

She holds up a RABBIT FOOT KEY-CHAIN.

                        TED
                 (deflated)
           Oh. Thanks.

They remain across the street from one another.

                        MARY
           Did you mean what you said back there, Ted?

Ted starts to well up again.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Ted...?

                        TED
                 (looking down)
           I...I just want you to be happy, Mary.

                        MARY
           But I think I'd be happiest...with you.

Ted just stares at her.

                        TED
           You're fucking with me, right?

Mary smiles.

                        TED (cont'd)
                 (wiping eyes)
           But but what about Steve?

                        MARY
           Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun--the guy
           doesn't even drink beer or gamble.

Now Ted smiles.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Get over here.

                        TED
           Really?

                        MARY
           Really.

The BEAMING Ted starts walking across the street. Suddenly a BUS
WHIZZES BY AND SMACKS TED BROADSIDE. He bounces around under the
bus like a rag doll, then finally squirts out the back end and
TUMBLES TO A LIMP STOP.

Mary SCREAMS and runs toward the body as a CROWD begins to gather.

                        MARY
           Ted, no, no....!

She starts giving him CPR. Somebody covers him with a blanket.

Just then, another CAR WHIZZES OVER HIS FEET like speedbumps. The
crowd winces.

                        MARY (cont'd)
           Somebody hold up traffic!
                 (beat)
           Come on, Ted. Come on. Tell me you're going
           to be okay.

Then Ted takes a deep breath and his eyes flutter open.

                        TED
           Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.

                        MARY
           I love you too, Ted.
                 (beat)
           I think I always have.

As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:

                        LADY
           Over here! I found his foot! It was in the
           storm drain!

ON THE LADY as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.

                        MARY
           All right, everyone, let's fan out and look
           for the penis!

As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and

                                                       FADE OUT.

          DJANGO REINHARDT'S "TEA FOR TWO".


   FADE IN:


   INT.   LIVING ROOM   -   NIGHT.

   ALBERT, a middle-aged man, feeds MELVIN, a two-year-old.

                    ADULT MELVIN (V.O.)
           I loved my father and he taught me
           many useful things. But he didn't
           teach me anything at all about
           women. There was a time when I
           resented that. And then, one day,
           it occurred to me that perhaps he
           didn't know all that much about
           the fairer sex.

   On the other side of the room, CORINNE, a vulgar,
   morbidly obese woman, sits on the couch and devours a
   large packet of potato chips.

                    ADULT MELVIN (V.O.)
           One look at my mother and I had
           conclusive proof.

   She burps loudly and gives a smile of satisfaction.


   EXT.   EAST PERTH STREETS    -    PRESENT DAY.

   MELVIN, now thirty-two, walks along with MIKE, three.
   Both are bespectacled.

                           MELVIN
           Here's what I'm going to do, son.
           I'll give it to you straight. I'm
           not going to fill your head with
           stories about fictitious characters
           like Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny
           or God. There's only one thing you
           need to worry about in this life and
           that's women. And I'm going to
           teach you everything I know about
           the art of meeting, courting and
           seducing 'em. Don't worry about
           anything else, there's nothing more
           important. Reading, writing, toilet
           training you can learn later in life.
                                                        2.

   INT.   DEPARTMENT STORE   -   DAY.

   Mike, wearing cute denim overalls with a teddy bear
   embroidered on the front, stands on a footstool in front
   of Melvin and a TAILOR.

                           MELVIN
           Clothes maketh or unmaketh the man.
           What were you thinking when you put
           that on this morning? That you were
           going to spend the day in the sandpit?

   Mike responds with a look of innocence and confusion.

                           MELVIN
                        (to tailor)
           We'll take the best you've got.
                         (to Mike)
           The finer the threads, the more
           inclined the ladies will be to tear
           them off. I know, don't try to make
           sense of their logic. They have none.


   EXT.   CAFE   -   DAY.

   Melvin at a table with Mike, who is now dressed in smart
   casual attire and looks more like his father.

                           MELVIN
           Of course, it's not all about clothes.
           It's the way you carry yourself too.
           You've gotta make a conscious effort
           to be relaxed but in control in all
           situations. And a little playful.
           Go for an expression where you're
           suppressing mild amusement. But
           don't overdo it. You want to look
           dignified at all times.

   Melvin glances over to Mike, who is picking his nose.

                           MELVIN
           Damnit, son! Are you not listening
           to a word I say?

   Mike freezes, unsure what to do, his finger still planted
   in his nostril. Melvin yanks it out.
                                                        3.

   EXT.   PRESCHOOL    -       DAY.

   Melvin and Mike approach the entrance.

                          MELVIN
          Now meeting the right person is
          really all about spending enough
          time in the right places. So we're
          going to a new preschool today. One
          in a higher socioeconomic suburb.


   EXT.   PLAYGROUND       -    DAY.

   Melvin and Mike sit on a bench and watch children at play.

                                    MELVIN
          Well?

   Mike looks around then points.

                          MELVIN
          You like the girl over there?

   Mike nods. She's MOLLY, three. A shy, bespectacled
   girl, she sits on her own and reads a book.

                          MELVIN
          Uh ... yeah. I think there's enough
          geek genes in our family. It's time
          to diversify.

   Elsewhere, BRITTANY, four, is taunting another child.

                          MELVIN
          And avoid that bitchy girl. She may
          be pretty but believe me, it's not
          worth the trouble. You definitely
          don't want to get involved with
          someone like your mother.

   Melvin keeps looking. He points out AMELIE, three,
   well-dressed and eating a baguette.

                          MELVIN
          Stay away from the French girl too.
          French women have no morals.
                                                        4.

                          MELVIN
          It might be great for a bit of slap
          and tickle after midnight when the
          only meat your buddies are getting
          is at a kebab shop. But there's no
          word in French for "fidelity" and
          what we're looking for is a serious
          relationship. I mean, what you're
          looking for.
                 (awkwardly unconvincing)
          I'm fine.

   SARAH, three, blonde and dressed in pink, sits at a table
   nearby. She talks excitedly with a group of girls.

                          MELVIN
          She's popular, good-looking. She
          seems friendly enough. I think
          Barbie there might be worth a try.

   Mike doesn't look so sure.

                          MELVIN
          Go and talk to her.

   Intimidated, Mike shakes his head, his eyes pleading.

                          MELVIN
          C'mon! It's better to get shot
          down than wonder "What if?"

   Melvin gives him a push in Sarah's direction.

                          MELVIN
          Just show an interest in the things
          that interest her and you'll have
          plenty to talk about.

   Mike, looking completely out of place in his flashy
   clothes, apprehensively approaches the girls. They stop
   talking and watch him.

   He picks up Sarah's handbag and admires it, putting it
   over his shoulder. Then he tries on her sun hat and
   slips into her discarded pink shoes. The girls laugh at
   him and run away.

   Melvin covers his face in disbelief.
                                                       5.

   A MOMENT LATER.

   Back on the bench, Melvin scolds Mike.

                           MELVIN
           Would you like to go to the toyshop
           later on? You can pick out a nice
           fairy costume. What are you doing
           to me, boy?!

   Mike shrugs defensively.

                           MELVIN
           We need to toughen up your image now.
           Most girls are attracted to bad boys.
           See if you can start some sort of
           altercation with her. Understand?

   Mike thinks, then nods his head.


   A MOMENT LATER.

   Mike grabs a handful of sand from the sandpit, marches up
   to Sarah and throws it forcefully into her face. Sarah
   starts to cry, drawing the attention of everyone in the
   playground. Mike smiles and looks to his father for
   approval. Melvin is horrified.


   INT.   FLORIST    -   DAY.

   Mike struggles with a large arrangement of flowers.
   Melvin pays the FLORIST.

                           MELVIN
           Well that was over the top but at
           least you got her attention. And
           it's better to be known as a jerk
           rather than a fruitcake. The good
           news is you now have the opportunity
           to apologise. If you can feign
           sincerity and a desperation for
           forgiveness, you should be able to
           endear yourself to her.
                        (to florist)
           Leave the price tag on. We want
           her to know how much we paid.
                                                                6.

   EXT.   PLAYGROUND    -   DAY.

   Melvin watches from the other side of the high fence.
   Mike carries the flowers across the playground.

   He sees Sarah being comforted by her friends.         Then he
   sees Molly, who is still reading her book.

   Melvin gestures for Mike to give the flowers to Sarah.
   Mike thinks, then gives them to Molly instead.

   Melvin groans and throws his hands up in frustration.


   EXT.   CARPARK   -   DAY.

   Melvin points his finger in Mike's face.

                           MELVIN
           I'm trying to do the right thing
           by you and you mess everything up!
           You're as incompetent as ... the
           government film funding bodies!

   MARY, early thirties and attractive, approaches with
   Molly, who carries the flowers.

                            MARY
           Molly loves her flowers.      Thank you.

   Melvin's attitude changes immediately.

                            MELVIN
           Oh.   No problem. They were my idea.

                            MARY
           Well it was a very nice gesture.

   She continues walking, then stops.

                            MARY
           We're going to lunch at the cafe on
           the corner. Would you and Mike like
           to join us?

                               MELVIN
           Absolutely.      We'll see you there.

   Mary and Molly leave.       Melvin turns back to Mike.
                                                            7.

                           MELVIN
           Great work my friend! Looks like
           we're in for a double date.

   He claps a high five with his son.

                           MELVIN
           And the perfect chance for you to
           learn from a master at work.


   INT.   CAFE ON THE CORNER      -   DAY.

   Melvin, Mike, Mary and Molly sit around a table. Before
   eating, Mary and Molly bow their heads in prayer. Mike
   watches them and does the same.

   Unseen by the others, Melvin decides to give thanks too.
   And not for the food in front of him.


   EXT.   PARK   -   DAY.

   Melvin and Mary sit and watch their children laugh as
   they chase each other about.

                            MARY
           They seem to like each other.

                           MELVIN
           They certainly do.

                            MARY
           Molly has a birthday party coming
           up. Would you like to come?

                              MELVIN
           Absolutely.

                            MARY
           I'm thinking about a sleepover?
           Or is it too soon?

   She smiles at him.       Melvin raises an eyebrow seductively.

                           MELVIN
           A "sleepover" would be great. No
           such thing as "too soon" when you're
           with the right person.
                                                        8.

   He moves closer to Mary. He puts one hand on her leg and
   uses the other to play with her hair. She pulls away
   violently and stands.

                            MARY
           What are you doing?!

                           MELVIN
           Getting to know you. Before the
           "sleepover".

                            MARY
           I meant Mike coming over to spend
           the night. Not his Dad.

                             MELVIN
           Oh.

   Unimpressed, she walks over to Molly, lifts her into her
   arms and they leave. Mike stares coldly at his father,
   his hands on his hips.


   EXT.   BUS STOP   -   DAY.

   Mike picks flowers from a nearby garden. Melvin sits
   alone, dejected. Mike approaches and whispers in his ear.

                           MELVIN
           It's better to get shot down than
           wonder "What if?"?

   Mike whispers more.

                           MELVIN
           I now have the opportunity to
           apologise and endear myself to her?

   Mike presents his father with a small arrangement of
   hand-picked flowers. Melvin thinks.

                           MELVIN
           Yeah! Yeah, you're right.   I've
           taught you well!

   He takes the flowers, leans over and kisses his boy
   fondly on the head.

                                                 FADE OUT.

                                       January 5, 1993

                       THE THREE MUSKETEERS

    OPEN ON:
1   EXT. GASCONY - DAWN                                        1

    Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from tree-
    tops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox
    darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out
    of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL.

    SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625.
    Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points
    cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The
    first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every
    facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance
    and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this
    moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous
    cry.

    They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew.
    Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is
    nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the
    air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somer-
    saults. This is fun.
    Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden
    fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they
    fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of
    hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots.
    Anything goes as the swords cut through the air.
    D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard
    up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly
    cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof,
    fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles...
    and follows.


2   ANGLE ON ROOFTOP                                           2

    Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard
    and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause
    to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other
    side, attacking, defending, as they go.

3   INCLUDE INTERIOR                                           3

    Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances
    up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof.
    She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open
    window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.

                                                        2.

4   BACK TO SCENE                                              4
    Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an en-
    closure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies
    after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild
    progress frequently resembles that of a young colt --
    stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his
    sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan
    parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over
    the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and
    rises to fight again.
    The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success de-
    volves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly
    endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the
    last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slow-
    moving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs
    toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan
    with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes
    when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap
    to join him.
    And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of
    music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morn-
    ing all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just
    then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard
    backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he
    stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He
    prepares one last blow --
    -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the
    side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical
    antidote to all this glorious swordplay.


5   INCLUDE CREEK                                              5
    Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of
    reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with
    grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation
    will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and
    lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's
    apple.

    A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh,
    long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.

                            D'ARTAGNAN
              Had enough?
                            GIRARD
                     (breathless
                      deadpan)
              I believe now would be a good
              time to end your, uhm, formal
              training. Well done.

                 Thank you, sir.

    D'Artagnan leaps to his feet, races off without another
    word. Girard struggles upward, peers at the shape of his
    clothing -- cut to ribbons, muddy and soaked.

                               GIRARD
                 And god have mercy on whomever
                 you meet next.

    She stands at the open window, watches his coltish high

    D'Artagnan steps through the country manor, calls out:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                 Mother...?

    But he does not see her.    D'Artagnan continues, chatter-
    ing proudly as he goes.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                 Did you see us? You heard us,
                 I'll bet. Girard finally
                 surrendered a compliment...
                 though I almost had to kill him
                 to get it... Mother...?
    D'Artagnan comes upon an open door, a small room beyond.
    He pauses, then steps inside.

    A piece of parchment, on it the words: "All For One, and

    gold tunic. Below it, the Handsome Woman, d'Artagnan's
    mother, kneels at an open chest. She turns back to him.

    D'Artagnan sighs, sits in a large wooden chair. A beat.
    His mother speaks quietly, eyes turned back to the open
    chest.
                               MOTHER
                 Your father was a proud man. And
                 he had a right to be. I never
                 knew one as brave or as kind. He
                 knew that his strength was a gift
                 to be given in the service of
                 honor. That is why he dedicated
                 his life to his country and his
                 King. That is why he gave his
                 life, for both.

    She reaches into the chest, carefully extracts a
    beautiful saber.
                               MOTHER
                 I watched you this morning and
                 saw someone I knew. You have
                 your father's heart, his will to
                 fight, his courage. But these
                 gifts have no value unless they
                 are given.
    She rises, holds the sword out to him.

                               MOTHER
                 It's time for you find your
                 fortune with men as brave and

     D'Artagnan can't help it, his eager reply leavens the
     nobility of the moment with warm humor, youthful inno-
     cence. His mother smiles as she repeats.

                                 MOTHER
                  Yes, son.   And now to you.
     With that, she holds out the beautiful saber.         D'Artagnan
     takes it firmly into his hands.

     Mother and son stand in the vast expanse. D'Artagnan
     holds a restless horse by the reins, his traveling satch-

                  I'm not your mother now. I'm

     D'Artganan's mother smiles, understands.       And speaks
     gently to urge him forward.

                                MOTHER
                  You've heard that every man in
                  the Musketeers is on the run from
                  someone or something?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   But what am I running from?

                  A shrew of a mother, and a drafty
                  old house. Now go.

     And in this fashion, she releases him. D'Artagnan sweeps
     his Mother into an embrace, now turns, heroic, and leaps
     into the saddle. The horse reacts with a start, skitters
     in a half-cicle. D'Artagnan struggles to gain control,
     finally brings the horse to rein. He manages a charmed
     grin. His mother smiles, scolds:
                                MOTHER
                  And for heaven's sake, practice
                  your horsemanship.

                  Horsemanship.    Got it.
     D'Artagnan digs his heels into the horse's flanks, shoots
     off across bright green fields. His Mother shields her
     eyes from the sun, feels a gathering of tears, and
     watches him ride into the distance.

     It FILLS the SCREEN, serves as background for the MAIN
     TITLES. As the FINAL CREDIT APPEARS, and the MUSIC ENDS,
     the blade of a sword ENTERS FRAME. It slides beneath the
     emblem, pries it off the wall. The emblem falls to the
     floor with an undignified thud. A fire blazes in a huge
     hearth behind it.


13   INCLUDE MUSKETEERS' HEADQUARTERS                             13
     A room in the Musketeers Headquarters. The fallen emblem
     is retrieved by JUSSAC, an officer who wears the bright
     red tunic of the Cardinal's Guards.
                             JUSSAC
               What should I do with this?

     Jussac offers   the emblem to a tall, elegant wraith in
     black finery,   a patch covers one eye. This is the COUNT
     DE ROCHEFORT,   Richelieu's right hand, one of the deadli-
     est swordsmen   in all of France.
                             ROCHEFORT
               Throw it on the fire with
               everything else.
                             JUSSAC
               But this is the emblem of the
               Musketeers...
                             ROCHEFORT
               The Musketeers no longer exist.
               Or haven't you heard?
                      (cold command)
               Throw it on the fire.
     Jussac hastily adds the emblem to the fiery blaze, it is
     instantly consumed. Rochefort watches it burn, then
     walks to a balcony overlooking a vast courtyard.

     Grim, funereal silence as a hundred Musketeers remove
     their blue and gold tunics, drop them into a pile that
     already contains their swords and muskets. The
     Musketeers remain stoic throughout, unwilling to reveal
     the depth of their despair. The latter is supervised by
     the Cardinal's Guards, who view their hated enemies'
     plight with satisfaction. This is a sad day for the
     Musketeers, the end of an era.

     MONSIEUR DE TREVILLE forces a salute toward the captain
     of the Cardinal's Guards, hands over his own musket.

     Treville is the respected leader of the Musketeers.       This
     is the saddest moment of all.

     Rochefort watches from above, a cruel smile twists his
     lips. He steps to the railing, addresses the men below.

                                  ROCHEFORT
                  Musketeers...
     A hundred faces turn   upward to regard him. And on each
     the same expression   -- absolute loathing for the man in
     black. Rochefort is    not intimidated by this sea of con-
     tempt. He revels in    it.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  By joint edict of His Majesty
                  King Louis XIII and His Eminence
                  Cardinal Richelieu, the
                  Musketeers are officially
                  disbanded. In preparation for
                  the coming war with England, your
                  ranks and commissions are hereby
                  transferred to the Infantry. You
                  will be contacted and told where
                  to report. Until that time, you
                  are instructed to return to your

                  And who will protect the King?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Cardinal's Guards are more
                  than capable of assuming that...
                  responsibility.

     Muttered curses and dissent throughout.       Rochefort raises
     his voice to be heard:

                                ROCHEFORT
                  You are hereby ordered to
                  disperse. Should even one of you
                  resist... the entire corps will
                  be arrested and imprisoned.
                         (with pleasure
                          and disdain)
                  'All for one, and one for all.'

     As Rochefort intended, the Musketeers explode. But
     before they can attack the Guards, de Treville's com-
     manding voice calls out above the clamor.

     And with that, the Musketeers freeze. Their eyes go to
     de Treville. There is a moment of silence as de Treville
     chooses his words carefully. Even in defeat, de Treville
     is stoic.

                                DE TREVILLE
                  Go to your homes. Wait. Our
                  day will come again.

     De Treville shoots a defiant look at Rochefort who smiles
     in a patronizing manner. Then, de Treville leads his
     Musketeers out of the courtyard.

     He returns to the adjoining room where Jussac stands by.
     Rochefort has enjoyed himself immensely. He goes to a
     mirror and preens, adjusting his eye patch to a more rak-
     ish angle. That's when he catches a glimpse of something
     behind him. Something red. Rochefort turns.
     a tall, powerfully built MAN stands in the shadows of the
     room, a spectre in red.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your Eminence.
     Rochefort and Jussac instantly fall to their knees.
     ARMAND DU PLEISS THE CARDINAL RICHELIEU steps out of the
     darkness and into the light, his long crimson robes
     swirling about him like clouds of blood. His face is
     long, shrewd and intelligent. His eyes are penetrat-
     ing. He smiles his crocodile smile.
     Richelieu observes a duty roster on one of the walls.
     It contains the names of all the Musketeers, past and
     present.

16   EXT. BOULEVARD OF CRIME - DAY                                   16
     Jussac leads   a regiment of the Cardinal's Gruards down
     Paris' most   colorful and notorious street. They react
     to SHOUTING   and VIOLENT NOISES coming from a tavern
     ahead. The    one called... The Dead Rat.
     The tavern door flies open, and two of the Cardinal's
     Guards are flung into the street, bruised and bloody.
     Just then: A window on the second floor bursts open,
     and a big Musketeer dangles a struggling Guard by his
     feet, threatening to drop him into the street. The
     Musketeer, a man of enormous appetites -- wine, women,
     song -- is called PORTHOS. Jussac shouts:
                                JUSSAC
                  Release that man!!
     Happy to comply, Porthos lets go of the Guard who plunges
     to the street with a dull thud. Then, with a wink and a
     piratical grin, Porthos ducks inside. Jussac darkens,
     signals his men, and they rush toward the tavern.


17   INT. TAVERN                                                     17

     Jussac and his company burst in and discover the room in
     a shambles, the aftermath of a violent fight. But for
     now, all is calm.

     A group of the Cardinal's Guards is seated around a big
     table littered with flagons and bottles. On the floor
     around them are their swords and rifles. It appears the
     Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's
     something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection,
     we see that the Guards have been stripped to their under-
     clothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are
     all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious.

     Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers.
     They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their
     boots up.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace hand-
     kerchief. He is ARAMIS, the most handsome and dashing of
     the Musketeers -- a poet and idealist -- a gentleman of
     great personal charm and style.
     His companion is   ATHOS, the Musketeers' deadliest and
     most charismatic   member -- also its most mysterious and
     tortured. Athos    is the unofficial leader of the Three
     Musketeers, their   planner and strategist. At the moment,
     he's sewing up a   nasty gash on his right arm.

                                JUSSAC
                         (approaching)
                  What is this?

     Athos greets him with a dark smile.

                                ATHOS
                  A private party. Go away.
                                ARAMIS
                  Athos -- is that any way to greet
                  our guests?

     Aramis leaps to his feet and bows graciously.    He is the
     epitome of politeness.
                                ARAMIS
                  Don't be shy, gentlemen. Come
                  in. Your friends have been
                  expecting you.
     Jussac is not amused.

                                JUSSAC
                  Your presence is requested at
                  Musketeer Headquarters by Captain
                  Rochefort.
     Athos and Aramis exchange looks.

                                ATHOS
                  The Cyclops is a Captain? He
                  must've made a pact with the
                  Devil.

                                ARAMIS
                  Or the Cardinal.
                                ATHOS
                  What's the difference?

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                            12.

                         (with an edge
                          of contempt)
                  The Devil is more ethical than
                  the Cardinal.

     Jussac takes a step forward, fingering his saber.

                                JUSSAC
                  You're instructed to come with
                  me and surrender your tunics.

     With a sweeping gesture, Athos indicates the bloody
     Guards around him.

                                ATHOS
                  These gentlemen made a similar
                  request.
                                JUSSAC
                  Are you refusing to come
                  peaceably?
                                ATHOS
                  Probably. But I'll leave it up
                  to my companions. Aramis?
                                ARAMIS
                  We can't refuse Rochefort's
                  invitation. It would be
                  impolite.
     Athos tips back in his chair and gazes upward.

                                ATHOS
                  And what do you say, Porthos?

     To the Guards' surprise, Porthos is balancing on the
     balcony rail above, just about even with a large wagon
     wheel chandelier.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'll be right down!
     With the grace of an aerialist, Porthos jumps from the
     balcony and lands atop the chandelier. His weight causes
     the chains suspending it to break. With a whoop of
     pleasure, Porthos rides the chandelier down as it lands
     squarely atop Jussac's Guards, squashing them.

     When the dust clears, only Jussac has been spared. He
     looks on in disbelief as Porthos extricates himself from
     the wreckage and calmly brushes his clothes off.

                  Ready when you are.
     Athos and Aramis sheathe their swords, put on their hats,
     wrap their capes around them and cross the room to join
     Porthos.
                                ARAMIS
                  Congratulations, Porthos.   You
                  brought down the house.
                                PORTHOS
                  My aim was off. I was trying to
                  hit Jussac.

     Athos fixes Jussac with a dark, threatening look.
                                 ATHOS
                  Now.   About those tunics...
     Jussac turns to watch Athos, Porthos, and Aramis step to
     the street. He mutters as if to curse:

18   EXT. HIGH ROAD TO PARIS - DAY                                  18
     D'Artagnan, on horseback, pauses on a bluff overlook-
     ing the magnificent city on the Seine. What he beholds
     is Paris as it looked in the early part of the Seven-
     teenth Century, its steeples and towers rising to meet the
     sky. For a country boy like d'Artagnan, Paris is a
     magical place where the wildest of dreams can come true.
     D'Artagnan's reverie is broken by the sound of THUNDERING
     HOOFBEATS coming from behind. He turns in response and
     what he sees is this:
     Two women on horseback are riding for all they're worth
     pursued by two men on horseback.

19   D'ARTAGNAN                                                     19

     His heroic blood stirs. Women in danger! As the women
     GALLOP past, d'Artagnan leaps from his horse. Quickly
     formulating a plan, he clambers up the trunk of a nearby
     tree and climbs out on a branch that overhangs the road.

                                                           14.

20   ANGLE                                                       20
     As the two riders pass underneath, d'Artagnan leaps into
     space and tackles one of them, knocking him out of the
     saddle. The rider hits the ground and is knocked sense-
     less. One down.
     D'Artagnan scrambles to his feet as the second rider re-
     verses direction and GALLOPS back, charging d'Artagnan.
     The rider draws his saber.
     D'Artagnan dodges the horse and the sword. He catches
     the second rider's arm and yanks him right out of the
     saddle. The man lands with a painful thud at
     d'Artagnan's feet. Before he can recover, d'Artagnan is
     upon him with flying fists. One swift punch -- and the
     second rider is senseless. Two down.

     D'Artagnan stands over his two victims, out of breath,
     but greatly pleased with his performance. He looks up as
     the two women ride back to see what's happened.
     The first woman is of noble breeding, a beautiful dark-
     haired girl in her late teens. Her name is ANNE. Her
     companion is roughly the same age, titan-haired and
     equally beautiful. Her name is CONSTANCE.
     Anne regards the two men on the ground, then d'Artagnan.
     She shakes her head, laughs with delight and rides off.
     Constance remains. She smiles down at d'Artagnan from
     atop her horse.
                             CONSTANCE
               Do you have any idea what you've
               done?

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I've saved you and your friend
               from these bandits.

                             CONSTANCE
               These 'bandits' are the Queen's
               own bodyguards.

     D'Artagnan is stunned.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
               The Queen?

     Constance points a finger in Anne's direction.
                             CONSTANCE
               If I were you, I'd make myself
               scarce. These men are going to be
               very angry when they wake up.

     D'Artagnan looks at the two bodyguards who are beginning
     to recover. Then he looks up at Constance, feeling like
     a prize idiot.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I didn't know. I thought...

     Constance smiles at him, her eyes twinkling.
                                CONSTANCE
                  Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                CONSTANCE
                  You're a very foolish boy,
                  d'Artagnan... but a very handsome
                  one. Good-bye.
     Constance spurs her horse and rides off to catch up with
     Anne.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (calling after her)
                  Wait!   You didn't tell me your
                  name!
     But Constance is gone.
     D'Artagnan stands in the middle of the road, feeling
     foolish and oddly thrilled at the same time. The two
     bodyguards groan and grumble.

     A bright reflection catches d'Artagnan's eye. He looks
     down and sees a gleaming bracelet. He picks it up and...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The man who attacked you...
                         (pointing in the
                          opposite direction)
                  ... went that way.
     With a guilty smile, d'Artagnan spurs his horse and rides
     like Hell.

22   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                             22
     Paris laid out for him like a jewel, cloaked in mystery,
     promising adventure and romance. D'Artagnan watches the
     women as they ride into the fabled city in the distance.
     He follows.

23   INT. MUSKETEER HEADQUARTERS - DAY                            23
     Athos, Aramis, and Porthos sweep into the now deserted
     courtyard. Silence -- the last thing they expected --
     stops them in their tracks. The place is a cemetery,
     haunted by the ghosts of generations of Musketeers.
     Porthos is visibly distraught. Rochefort enters from
     behind an archway.

                             ROCHEFORT
               I'll take those tunics,
               Musketeers.

               He said he'll take those tunics.
                              PORTHOS
               Tunics?   Coming right up.
     Porthos reaches inside his cloak and takes out a crumpled
     red tunic he took from one of the Cardinal's guards. He
     drops it on the ground, digs into a pocket and takes out
     another. He finds another in his boot and another up his
     sleeve. There's one in his hat. Like a magician, he
     keeps pulling red tunics out of the most bizarre places.

     Athos and Aramis have a few guard tunics themselves.
     They pull them out and drop them into the growing pile.

                             ATHOS
               I was trying to remember the last
               time I saw you here. I know. It
               was the day you were kicked out of
               the Musketeers.

               You ought to know. Three witnesses
               stood against me.

                  surrender your commissions and
                  make yourselves available for
                  reassignment in the King's Army.

                                ATHOS
                  And if we refuse?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You will become outlaws.   Hunted
                  men.
                                PORTHOS
                  It doesn't matter where I go or
                  what I do. Sooner or later
                  somebody's calling me 'outlaw.'
     Athos cuts him off with a look. He's familiar with
     Porthos' propensity for tall tales. But not here, not
     now. Athos turns back to the balcony. Rochefort lobs a
     taunt.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Are you refusing to serve your
                  King?
                                ARAMIS
                  We are refusing to serve the
                  Cardinal.
                                PORTHOS
                  Same thing, these days.
                                ARAMIS
                  France has one King too many.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll tell him you said that.

     Athos, who has remained silent, speaks with quiet power:

                                ATHOS
                  Do that, Rochefort. Tell his
                  Emminence the Cardinal that we
                  will continue to perform our sworn
                  duty to protect the King. From
                  enemies across the sea.

                  Musketeers.

     The gauntlet has been thrown.       Rochefort picks it up with
     glee.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll make sure His Emminence the
                  Cardinal gets the message. But I
                  can't promise he'll be pleased.

     Rochefort steps back, disappears into the shadows.       A
     beat. The Musketeers regard each other.
                                PORTHOS
                  Well, if we're going to be
                  outlaws, I suppose we'll have to

24   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - DAY                                  24

     D'Artagnan rides through the streets of Paris. A country
     boy happily stunned by the sights, sounds, and smells of
     the city. Merchants gossip and call to each other from
     shop doors. Colorful vendors and pedestrians move along
     the crowded boulevard. Acrobats, puppeteers, and jug-
     glers perform on street corners. LAUGHTER and MUSIC
     drift from taverns and public houses.

     D'Artagnan views it all with great enthusiasm. He sees
     the exterior of the Musketeer Headquarters... wow! The
     future belongs to him.

25   ATHOS                                                        25
     He crosses the courtyard to a large wooden door. But as
     he reaches for the handle, the door flies open and smacks
     him in his injured arm.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (as he enters)
                  Look out!
                                ATHOS
                         (wincing in pain)
                  Aaarrgghh...

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (in a panic; looking
                          around)
                  Where are they? Where are the
                  Musketeers? I'm in the right
                  place, aren't I?

                                ATHOS
                         (through gritted
                          teeth)
                  Not as far as I'm concerned.

     Athos is wearing his cape in such a way that it hides
     his Musketeer tunic. D'Artagnan has no idea who he's
     dealing with.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But this is Musketeer
                  Headquarters...

                                ATHOS
                  No. This was Musketeer
                  Headquarters.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You mean it's been moved?

                                ATHOS
                  I mean the Musketeers have been
                  disbanded. Feel free to poke
                  around for souvenirs.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean 'disbanded'?

                                ATHOS
                  Some nonsense about being needed in
                  the army. Now if you'll excuse
                  me...
     D'Artagnan blocks Athos' path.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But I just got here. How can I
                  become a Musketeer if they've been
                  disbanded?
                                ATHOS
                  I'd say you've got a problem.
     D'Artagnan grabs Athos by his injured arm. Athos, stif-
     ling pain, fixes d'Artagnan with a deadly look.
                                ATHOS
                  You could use a lesson in manners.
     D'Artagnan touches his sword, eyes flashing at the pos-
     sibility of a duel.
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Any time.

                                ATHOS
                  I'm in a hurry now -- but I'll
                  meet you at the Carmes-Deshaux
                  monastery at noon.

     Athos exits.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (calling after him)
                  I'll be there ten minutes early.

                  An hour in Paris, and I already
                  have my first duel!
     Just then, d'Artangnan spies two familiar figures on
     horseback, distinctive cloaks hiding their faces. Anne
     and Constance, though he does not yet know their names.
     D'Artagnan hurries after.

                  But, Catherine, don't you see? As
                  an outlaw I'll be constantly on
                  the run from the Cardinal's guards,
                  a refugee. Think of all the places
                  you can hide me. I'm thinking of
                  them now.

     reveals Porthos leaning against an open window, speaking
     amiably to a pretty woman on the other side. She dabs a
     tear from her eye, manages a nod.


28   ANGLE ON D'ARTAGNAN                                    28
     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan races around another corner, down a
     narrow lane, and speeds after the ladies on horseback.
     He dashes through a muddy puddle -- spraying foul water
     all over Porthos where he stands. D'Artagnan doesn't
     notice, a huge cart loaded with wine barrels has rolled
     INTO VIEW, blocking the lane. Fellow travelers shout
     complaints, the cart driver shakes his head, makes an
     obscene gesture. It's a Seventeenth Century traffic jam.

     D'Artagnan sees Anne and Constance dismount in the dis-
     tance, tie their horses, and step into an alley. A man
     waits in the shadows to escort them. D'Artagnan leaps
     off his horse, he means to continue his pursuit on foot.
     But he takes two quick steps, and... runs directly into
     Porthos' outstretched hand.

     D'Artagnan looks up -- literally, given Porthos' impres-
     sive stature -- and sees the Musketeer's muddied tunic,
     and worse, a unique and expensive sash, now thoroughly
     soiled.
                                PORTHOS

                  from?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  No.
                                PORTHOS
                  It is a gift from the Queen of
                  America.
     Porthos' righteous indignation is more impressive than
     his knowledge of current affairs. D'Artagnan corrects.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  There is no Queen of America.

                  That seems to be the local custom.

                  Me, you idiot.

     D'Artagnan gives him a blank look.

     Porthos couldn't be more insulted.       He sputters with
     rage.

                  Bring your own!


29   EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - ALLEY - DAY                               29
     D'Artagnan thinks he sees     Anne and Constance, races down
     the alley, turns a corner,     down a short street, makes a
     hasty decision, runs down     yet another alley... and tum-
     bles into a shadowy lane.      He stops, looks left and
     right. And does see them.

     The ladies enter a chapel's back door, close the door
     behind them. D'Artagnan flies after, skids across cob-
     blestones, rips the door open... and finds himself face
     to face with the man who has escorted Anne and Constance
     this far.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Let me pass.

                  I'm afraid that's not possible.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I must speak to those young women.

                                CARDINAL'S GUARD
                  The young women do not wish to be
                  spoken to.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I have something that belongs to
                  the Queen.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  A bracelet.
                                GUARD
                  I'll deliver it for you.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  No, you've been enough help
                  already. Would you be so kind
                  as to point out the Carmes-Deshaux
                  Monastery?
     The Guard points to a large building in the distance with
     a large cross.

     PAN ACROSS the Virgin Mary and many lit candles to a
     BEAUTIFUL DAMSEL sharing a love seat with the third
     Musketeer, the dashing Aramis. Aramis has a book open
     and is reading from it.
     The Damsel suddenly grabs Aramis and kisses him on the
     mouth. Aramis politely extricates himself. He's not the
     least bit embarrassed, only slightly amused.

                                ARAMIS
                  Madam, I'm flattered but I thought
                  you wanted me to tutor you in
                  theology.

                                DAMSEL
                  Excuse me, Monsieur Aramis. But
                  when you started talking about
                  Original Sin, I lost control and
                  became impassioned. It won't
                  happen again.

                                ARAMIS
                  There's nothing unholy about
                  expressing one's emotions. On
                  the contrary. Religion should be
                  experienced in a passionate, all-
                  embracing way. We should feel
                  free to express our spirituality.

                                  DAMSEL
                  Yes, darling!
     The Damsel attacks him again.         Suddenly, a pounding on
     the door.
                                  MAN (O.S.)
                  Open up!

                                DAMSEL
                         (a gasp of fear)
                  My husband!
                                ARAMIS
                  Your husband!?
                                DAMSEL
                  Aramis -- run!

     But Aramis' heart is too noble.         He gets down on his
     knees.

                                ARAMIS
                  First we must pray to God for
                  forgiveness.

     That's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband,
     an irate MARQUIS enters with a pistol. His eyes blaze
     with madness. He aims the pistol at Aramis' head.

                                ARAMIS
                  On second thought, God's often
                  busy.
     Aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window.

     As the Marquis aims and FIRES, Aramis puts one foot on
     the ledge and leaps into space. The shot misses him by
     inches.

                                                            26.

31   STREET BELOW                                                 31
     As d'Artagnan runs past. Aramis lands on top of him and
     they go crashing to the cobblestones. As they untangle
     themselves and get up...
                             ARAMIS
               Thanks. You broke my fall
               perfectly. But I do apologize
               for the inconvenience...
                             D'ARTAGNAN
                      (angry)
               Get off me!
     D'Artagnan pushes Aramis aside. Aramis grabs d'Artagnan
     by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.

                             ARAMIS
               If there's one thing I can't
               abide, it's rudeness.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               You fell on me!
                             ARAMIS
               And I apologized for it.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I suppose you'd like to teach me a
               lesson in manners, too.
                             ARAMIS
               I'd be honored.
     D'Artagnan brightens.   Another duel!
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               How's two o'clock behind the
               Luxembourg?
     Aramis bows politely.

                             ARAMIS
               If that's where you wish to die,
               I won't disappoint you. Until
               then...

     Aramis takes off.   d'Artagnan swells with pride.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               Three duels in one day. I love
               this town.

32   EXT. LOUVRE - DAY                                            32
     The Royal Palace of Louis XIII.

                             ANNE (V.O.)
               Have you seen the King?
                             SENESCHAL (V.O.)
               No, Your Majesty.

33   INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY                                       33

     Anne, or rather, Queen Anne, steps into the throne room,
     a massive cathedral-like chamber. Twin thrones occupy
     a raised dais. An entire wall is covered with a spectac-
     ular map of the world. The map contains every known
     country and continent, including the New World. The
     SENESCHAL exits, closing the doors with a resounding boom.
     Anne pauses, all alone in the big, drafty chamber. And
     for the first time, she looks and acts her age. Barely
     a woman, chilled by the ghosts of all the French kings
     and queens who came before her. And a long way from
     home. Anne steps to the great map of the world. She
     reaches out to touch her own country, Austria, feels a
     pang of separation. We hear:
                             MAN (O.S.)
               Your Majesty...

     Anne reacts with a start. A tall, powerfully built man
     stands in the shadows, a spectre in red.
                             ANNE
               Cardinal Richelieu, you surprised
               me.
     Cardinal Richelieu steps out of the darkness.     He smiles.

                             RICHELIEU
               How was your ride?

     Richelieu's question takes her by surprise. He bows
     before Anne. Considering a reply, she extends her hand.
     The Cardinal kisses it.

                               ANNE
               My ride...?    Well, I... I'm not
               sure...
                             RICHELIEU
                      (rising up)
               Forgive me.

               But your welfare is
               more than a matter of personal
               interest. It is a matter of
               State. But rest assured, your
               secret is safe with me.

     His manner is both charming and paternal. Anne, smart
     enough to exercise caution in all her palace dealings,
     is nonetheless touched by his concern.

                                 ANNE
                  Thank you.
     Richelieu turns to the great map, speaks gently.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You're homesick.
                                ANNE
                         (after a beat)
                  Lonely. Is that the same thing?
                                 RICHELIEU
                  Sometimes.
     Richelieu brings his eyes back to Anne, continues:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Austria's loss is France's gain.
                                ANNE
                  I'm not sure my new husband shares
                  your opinion.
                                  RICHELIEU
                  Nonsense.    He's young, not blind.

                                ANNE
                  Mostly, he is absent. I've barely
                  seen His Majesty since our wedding,
                  and that was three months ago.
                  Whenever he's around me, he has
                  nothing to say.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Arranged marriages can be
                  difficult. Your father and I
                  thought yours would bring Austria
                  and France closer together.

                                ANNE
                  Countries align more swiftly than
                  people, I'm afraid. Louis and I
                  remain... far apart.
                                RICHELIEU
                  May I advise you?

     He says it with seeming humility, not condescension.        Anne
     nods assent.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Louis was only nine years old
                  when his father was assassinated.
                  He lost his childhood forever that
                  day. I have watched him grow
                  toward manhood, seen the toll his
                  life demands. A boy who is not
                  allowed to be a boy sometimes has
                  difficulty becoming a man. He is
                  shy, yet boastful. Giving, yet
                  stubborn. But most of all, he is
                  not yet sure exactly who he is.
                  The boy who lost his father. Or
                  the King of France.
                                ANNE
                  But how can I...?

                                RICHELIEU
                  Flatter him. Make the boy feel
                  like a King. So that the King
                  may be your husband.

     Anne considers his eloquent advice, formulates a reply...
     when the huge doors to the throne room open with a dull
     boom, the Seneschal chants:

                                SENESCHAL
                  His Majesty, the King.

     The Seneschal steps aside as LOUIS XIII enters. He is
     surprisingly young, no older than d'Artagnan. His face
     is handsome and intelligent.

                                  RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty.
                                LOUIS
                  Cardinal Richelieu, I've been
                  looking for you.

     As Louis strides toward them, Richelieu and Anne bow.

     When Louis sees Anne, he reacts with an almost imper-
     ceptible start. Her presence catches him off guard.

                                LOUIS
                  Oh. Anne. Hello. I didn't know
                  you were here.

     Louis hides his nervousness, not to mention his love,
     behind a formal veneer. Anne, emboldened by Richelieu's
     confidences, replies:

                                ANNE
                  Would you like me to go?
     Louis suddenly remembers the reason he's here.       Determin-
     ation breeds a more capable attitude.

                                LOUIS
                  No.  Please, stay.
                         (to Richelieu, aware
                          that she is watching
                          him)
                  Your Eminence, I demand an answer.

                  I've just been told that you went
                  ahead and disbanded my Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  You approved the decision.
                                LOUIS
                  But not the timing of the matter.
                  I intended to address them myself,
                  explain the situation...
                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty, France is on the
                  brink of war. We dare not
                  hesitate.

                                LOUIS
                  But these men are my personal
                  guards...

                  We'll need them in the
                  field if we're to win this war
                  with England. Buckingham plans
                  to invade La Rochelle within the
                  month. I thought it best to act
                  quickly --

                                LOUIS
                  I will be the judge of what is
                  best. For me, and for France.

     He says it with newfound resolve. Richelieu receives the
     rebuke with quiet grace. Anne watches the latter closely,
     suppresses a smile. The boy is nearer to King than
     Richelieu imagined.

                                 RICHELIEU
                  Of course.   Forgive me.
     A tense beat.    Anne, feeling out of place, steps toward
     the door.

     She means it.    Anne smiles, exits.      A beat.   Louis sighs.

     Repetition reveals calculation. Louis nods.       And the
     Cardinal surprises with quiet humor:

                  She scares me too. As do all

                  intelligence. What's a man to

                  The course of love is full of

                  how you feel, no matter how

                  her know that you are anything
                  other than the bravest and most
                  confident man in France. Make
                  that your starting point, and

     D'Artagnan walks proudly toward the Carmes-Deschaux
     monastery, bold and brave, his future at hand. Suddenly.

                                COACH DRIVER (O.S.)
                  Get out of the way, idiot!!

     A speeding carriage bears down on him. D'Artagnan leaps
     from its path, stumbles. He looks up in time to see the
     passenger inside, and for a moment, time seems to stop.

     She is a noblewoman of remarkable beauty, her face framed
     by the carriage window. Long blonde curly hair that
     cascades in ringlets to her shoulders, languid blue eyes,
     and skin as white as alabaster. She is known as MILADY
     DE WINTER. She is to sex, what Constance is to innocence.

     D'Artagnan watches as if in a dream. The carriage, the
     beautiful woman inside it. Paris wraps its arms around
     the young man's heart. Suddenly: a second face enters the
     carriage window, replacing hers, jarring by contrast. It
     is the fierce visage of Milady's Indo-Chinese Bodyguard,
     PARKER. The bodyguard glares, pulls at the carriage
     window curtains, taking Milady, the dream, from view.
     HOLD ON d'Artagnan, bewitched, as the CARRIAGE RUMBLES off
     into the city.

     A beautiful house situated near the Seine. Milady's
     carriage stops before it. She steps to the street,
     Parker follows. After a brief spoken exchange, the body-
     guard departs on some errand. HENRI, the driver, a brutal-
     looking fellow, incongruous in his elegant coachman's
     uniform, snaps the reins, and guides the carriage away.
     Milady steps inside.


37   ANOTHER ANGLE - POV                                         37
     REVEALS this to have been the POV of two men standing in
     the shadows across the street. COUNT DE WINTER, forty-
     five, a kind face etched with sadness, and ARMAND DE
     WINTER, twenty-five, his son. They are well-dressed. But
     their manner and appearance suggests that they have
     traveled a long distance to find her.
                               COUNT DE WINTER
                  Wait here.

                  Wait.
     He will not consider otherwise. Armand sighs, stands in
     the shadows, and watches his father cross toward Milady's
     house.

     Milady stands before a mirror, reaches for one of the many
     ivory combs that adorn her hair. As she places the comb
     we notice a small flower-like tattoo on her arm. She
     pauses to admire her beauty, then to see the image of
     Count de Winter, now standing behind her, his eyes dark
     and cold. Milady does not move from the reflecting glass,
     she smiles.

                             MILADY
               Count de Winter.

                             COUNT DE WINTER
                      (as much happiness as
                       the thought allows)
               We found you.

                             MILADY
                      (eyes on the mirror)
               Yes. Now that you have, what
               will you do?
                             COUNT DE WINTER
               Bring you back. To pay for what
               you did to my son.
                             MILADY
               And if I resist...?

                      (voice breaking with
                       emotion)
               I will kill you with my bare
               hands.

     The Count steps closer, close enough to touch. Milady,
     eyes bright with excitement, the smile still playing about
     her lips, replies:

                             MILADY
               Well if that's the case, I'd
               better start packing. But first,
               my hair...
     Milady, who has been removing combs throughout, reaches
     for the next, and...

     father, or Milady. He calls out:

               Father?

     Worry makes him hurry. Armand takes hasty steps into
     Milady's bedroom. The first thing he sees is his own
     face in the mirror. The second is his father's inert
     body below it. Armand gasps, races to his side. A thin
     trail of bright blood is seen briefly at the older man's
     ear. Armand gathers his father up into his arms, and
     begins to weep.

     The monastery is a windowless building   bordered by a
     barren field, a dueling ground for men   who have little
     time to waste.  Athos sits on a stone   bench, waits for
     his adversary to arrive. His horse is    hobbled nearby.

               I have another appointment at one.

               You'll miss it, I'm afraid.

                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I'll try my best to be on time.

     Athos appreciates the young man's retort, takes a closer
     look. Then he rises to his feet, the pain in his arm
     makes him wince.

                             ATHOS
               I asked two of my friends to act
               as seconds, but they are not as
               punctual.

     D'Artagnan notices Athos' pained expression, the blood on
     his sleeve.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               But you're wounded.

                             ATHOS
               Don't worry. I fight just as well
               with my left hand.

                  Thanks, but I see my seconds
                  coming now.

     Porthos and Aramis arrive on horseback. They dismount,
     view d'Artagnan with amazement. D'Artagnan reacts with
     similar surprise, smiles sheepishly.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Athos)
                  What're you doing? You can't
                  fight this man.

                                ATHOS
                  Why not?
                                PORTHOS
                  Because I'm fighting him.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Excuse me, monsieur. But not
                  until one o'clock.
                                ARAMIS
                         (amused)
                  Wait a minute. I've got a duel
                  with him, too.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, sir.   But not until two.
                                ATHOS
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  How long have you been in Paris?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I arrived this morning.

                                ATHOS
                  You've been... busy.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I've also fallen in love.
                                ATHOS
                         (gruff to a fault)
                  Better to die for love than to
                  live for it. Gentlemen?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              38.

     Athos gestures for Aramis and Porthos to stand aside. He
     draws his saber, ready to fight. A beat. And in that
     moment, d'Artagnan's face reveals an emotion he has never
     felt before in his young life. Fear. Athos sees it,
     allows him a moment to withdraw his saber. D'Artagnan
     does so, they square off, touch sabers, and...

     ... Jussac leads a patrol of the Cardinal's Guards INTO
     VIEW.
                                JUSSAC
                  There they are!!
     Athos and d'Artagnan separate as Jussac and his four
     swordsmen stride towards them.

                                 ARAMIS
                  Jussac.   Again.
     Athos steps forward to meet him.
                                ATHOS
                  I told you the next time we met
                  I'd want an answer. But I didn't
                  expect you so soon.
                                JUSSAC
                  The three of you are under arrest.
                  The boy's of no interest to me
                  and is free to go. Do you intend
                  to resist?
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, don't be stupid. Of course we
                  intend to resist. Just give us
                  a second.

     Porthos huddles with Athos and Aramis.
                                PORTHOS
                  Interesting odds. Five of them
                  and three of us.
                                ARAMIS
                  It hardly seems fair. Let's give
                  them the chance to surrender.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (interrupting)
                  Excuse me, but there are four of
                  us.

     They turn and regard d'Artagnan.
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                               39.

                                ATHOS
                  This is not your fight.    You're
                  not a Musketeer.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I may not wear the uniform, but I
                  believe I have the heart of a
                  Musketeer.
     The three Musketters exchange smiles. D'Artagnan's
     youthful bravado manages a small dent in their cynicism.

                                PORTHOS
                  Bold and brave.

                                ARAMIS
                  A poet.
                                ATHOS
                  Have you got a name, boy?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                PORTHOS
                         (startled)
                  D'Artagnan?
     The name has meaning for all of them. The Musketeers
     look at each other, deadpan, shake their heads.
                                ARAMIS
                  Impossible.

                                PORTHOS
                  It couldn't be.

     Athos knows that it is. He steps forward, extends a
     hand. The others follow, shake as well. Athos intro-
     duces each in turn.

                                ATHOS
                  Athos... Porthos... Aramis.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Pleased to meet you... How do you
                  do?... Good to see you again...
     Meanwhile, Jussac and his Guards look on with increasing
     impatience. He clears his throat, draws his saber. The
     Musketeers turn toward the Guards, d'Artagnan standing
     among them.
                                                      (CONTINUED)

                                PORTHOS
                  Well. Now that we're all
                  acquainted...
                                ATHOS
                  The Cardinal's Guards.

     D'Artagnan and the Musketeers draw their swords... and
     charge.

42   FIGHT                                                      42
     Suddenly: nine men are locked in mortal combat. Athos
     takes a Guard named Cahusac, Porthos battles BISCARAT,
     and Aramis battles with two adversaries at once.
     D'Artagnan looks for an opponent... and finds himself
     face to face with Jussac.
     The fighting style of the Musketeers is an exuberant mix-
     ture of styles and techniques. Athos is a brutal swords-
     man, his strokes overpowering and savage. His repertoire
     also includes swift kicks, solid punches, the occasional
     elbow when necessary. Aramis is a seamless and graceful
     technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic
     ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than
     paint and canvas.
     And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all,
     Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of
     bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo,
     nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill
     of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his
     already impressive size and strength, and you have a one-
     man wrecking crew of epic proportions.
     D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar. He
     bounds about like a newborn tiger, encircles his adver-
     sary, changing stance and shifting his ground with alac-
     rity. Jussac is having a hard time defending himself
     against his opponent who seems to be attacking from all
     directions at once.
                                JUSSAC
                         (losing patience)
                  Stand still! How do you expect
                  me to kill you if you keep jumping
                  around!!

43   MONASTERY                                                  43

     A monk watches from the bell tower, incensed by the battle
     raging on the field below. He grabs the BELL rope, gives
     it a mighty pull... and sounds a clamorous ALARM.

                                                           41.

44   BACK TO SCENE                                               44
     Porthos reacts to the interruption with irritation. He
     produces a pair of nunchucks. Biscarat looks at the odd
     weapon with professional curiosity, slight confusion...
     and Porthos whacks him on the side of the head, knocks
     him to the ground.

                             PORTHOS
                      (eyes on the tower)
               Damn monks. Always spoiling
               everybody's fun.

     Aramis replies while shifting from one foe to the next.
                             ARAMIS
               They are nearer to God...

                             PORTHOS
               They're about to get a little
               nearer to the hilt of my sword.
                               ARAMIS
               Pagan.
                               PORTHOS
               Papist.
     Porthos slides over to handle one of Aramis' opponents.
     He'd rather bicker from close range. But Biscarat
     struggles to his feet, grabs his saber. Porthos sees
     him, sighs.
                             PORTHOS
                      (to Aramis)
               Excuse me?
                             ARAMIS
               I'm fine, thank you.

     And Porthos returns to his original foe. Meanwhile,
     Athos' heavy strokes take their toll. Cahusac staggers,
     wounded in arm, shoulder, grazed at the head -- and falls
     to the ground with a thud. Aramis calls out to him,
     indicates d'Artagnan:
                             ARAMIS
               Take a look at our young friend.

                             ATHOS
               You mean he's still alive?

     Not only is d'Artagnan alive, but he's making a fool out
     of Jussac.  Frustrated, enraged, Jussac makes a full lunge
     at him, but d'Artagnan ducks, then slips under Jussac's
     sword like a snake and runs him through.

                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              42.

44   CONTINUED:                                                     44
     Jussac falls to the ground, lies still.    He is dead.

     Athos and Aramis react, impressed. Then turn their full
     attention on weakening foes. They disarm and disable
     them with swift strokes. Meanwhile, Porthos chases
     Biscarat into a grove of trees. The Guard has discovered
     the better part of valor, now runs for his life. Porthos
     -- who is at play as much as he is war -- takes a Spanish
     bolo from his cloak, and whips the balls over his head.
     Biscarat hears the odd WHIZZING sound, turns to face him.
     The color drains from his face.

                                 BISCARAT
                  Now what...?

     Porthos lets the bolo fly -- it catches Biscarat about
     the neck, the balls slam into his head. The Guard drops
     to the ground without a sound.
                                PORTHOS
                  God, I love my work.


45   AFTERMATH                                                      45
     A sudden silence, save for the occasional dull groan.
     D'Artagnan scans the battlefield, sees Aramis bending
     over Jussac's body, speaking in solemn tones under his
     breath.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (to Athos)
                  What's he doing?

                                ATHOS
                  Last rites. Aramis takes death
                  very seriously.

     Porthos returns in high spirits, stashes the bolo in a
     pouch under his cloak. D'Artagnan sees the other weapons
     there, including a boomerang. Maybe next time.

                                PORTHOS
                         (re: the bolo)
                  Do you know where this bolo comes
                  from?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (a bold jest, given
                          the circumstances)
                  The Queen of America?

                                 PORTHOS
                  Spain.

     Porthos deadpans, then grins acceptance.      All for one,
     and one for all. D'Artagnan beams.

                                ARAMIS
                  Don't encourage him. By killing
                  Jussac, the boy's made himself
                  an outlaw too.

                                ATHOS
                  Not if he leaves Paris. Which is
                  exactly what he's going to do.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I can't leave. I just got here.

                                PORTHOS
                  Go home, find a wench, live long
                  and prosper.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why can't I stay with you?
     Aramis and Porthos look to Athos.      As always, he will
     decide.
                                ATHOS
                  Because I do not want you to.
     It's hard to say whether he's acting out of concern for
     the boy... or he simply doesn't give a damn. Whatever
     the case, d'Artagnan is crestfallen. The Musketeers
     mount their horses, Porthos and Aramis adopt a friendlier
     tone.

                                ARAMIS
                  I know Athos may seem cold and
                  unfriendly, but don't let that
                  fool you.
                                PORTHOS
                  He really is cold and unfriendly.

                                ARAMIS
                  But he's also right. This is our
                  fight, not yours. Go on, get out
                  of here.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Whatever happened to the motto of
                  the Musketeers? 'All for one,
                  and one for all.'

                                  ATHOS
                  Wake up, boy.    The Musketeers are
                  just a dream.

     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     follow. HOLD ON d'Artagnan as he watches the Musketeers
     grow small in the distance. Then, sadly, he steps to his
     horse, climbs into the saddle. It has been both the best
     and the worst day of his young life.

     That's when a group of horsemen come riding around the
     corner of the monastery -- five Cardinal's Guards led by
     Rochefort himself. They see their wounded comrades,
     Jussac dead, and the three Musketeers escaping in the
     distance.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (pointing)
                  There they go! After them!

     But before Rochefort and the Guards can give chase,
     d'Artagnan rides into the middle of the field to
     challenge them, as if to further prove himself worthy
     of the blue and gold.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (defiant)
                  Long live the Musketeers.
     And d'Artagnan draws his saber.


     AT DISTANCE
     The three Muskeeters rein their horses, look back to
     d'Artagnan's bold charge.
                                PORTHOS
                         (with admiration)
                  Do you believe this kid.

     D'Artagnan gallops toward the Guards to engage them.    He
     races through PISTOL SHOTS like a demon possessed.
     Rochefort rides to the lead, draws his sword.

                                ROCHEFORT
                         (shouts to the
                          others)
                  Fall back! I'll take him myself!

     And like two jousting knights, d'Artagnan and   Rochefort
     meet in the middle of the field. Their BLADES    connect
     with a resounding CLASH, d'Artagnan is knocked   clear of
     his saddle. He hits the ground with a painful    thud.
     Rochefort's Guards leap towards him.

                                                            45.

     Porthos and Aramis are greatly moved by d'Artagnan's
     courage.

                              PORTHOS
                Rochefort's got the boy.

                              ATHOS
                       (seemingly unmoved)
                Too bad.
                              ARAMIS
                You can't just leave him.
     Athos spurs his horse, rides away. Aramis and Porthos
     exchange sad looks and hopeful comments.

                              ARAMIS
                He has a plan.
                               PORTHOS
                Definitely.   A plan.
     And with that, they gallop after.

     Meanwhile, d'Artagnan is soon outnumbered, and quickly
     subdued.
                              GUARD
                This boy fights like a wildcat.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (exhausted)
                Thank you.

     The Guard clobbers d'Artagnan with the scabbard of his
     sword. The last thing d'Artagnan sees is the three
     Musketeers riding into the distance. Then the WORLD
     TILTS, GOES SUDDENLY BLACK.

     FADE IN:

48   EXT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        48

     The walls and towers of France's most infamous prison
     rise to meet a starless sky. The portcullis is raised
     by men-at-arms, admitting a spectacular crimson carriage
     pulled by a team of snow-white stallions. The emblem of
     the Cardinal of France is emblazoned on the carriage
     door, and THROUGH its WINDOW we see the profile of
     Richelieu.

     Lovingly, he fingers the upholstery of his extravagant
     carriage.

                                                    CUT TO:

49   INT. DUNGEON - NIGHT                                           49

     A chamber in hell. Spiders the size of rats, rats the
     size of small dogs. A foul stench in the air. D'Artagnan
     is sprawled in a corner, unconscious, on a filthy matted
     floor. The sharp tip of a sword pokes him in the chest.
     D'Artagnan wakes with a start, springs back into action.
     As if he was still battling Jussac at the Carmes-Deschaux.
     He slaps the sword away, leaps to his feet, and reaches
     for his own. But it is gone.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  My sword --
                                ROCHEFORT
                  It's magnificent. Where did you
                  get it?

     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring
     d'Artagnan's sword in his hands.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  It belonged to my father.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Your father...

     Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then...
                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well now it belongs to me. I
                  collect swords. I take them
                  from the men I kill.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm not dead yet.
     D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the
     sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes,
     feels the sharp tip of the blade.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Soon enough.

     Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a
     heavy boot. A beat. D'Artagnan peers at his dismal
     surroundings.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  Where am I?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  I'll give you a hint. It's not
                  the Louvre.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (realizing)
                  The Bastille! I'm in the Bastille!

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Well, you're the first person who
                  was ever happy to be here.
                  Unfortunately, your visit will be
                  a short one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What do you mean?
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You killed one of the Cardinal's
                  Guards. An offense punishable
                  by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He interrupted a duel I was
                  fighting.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Also punishable by death.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  It was a long day.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You know them?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Who?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  The Musketeers.
     D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them.
     Rochefort leans close.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Tell me where they are, and I
                  will be lenient.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  How?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                             48.

                         (after a beat)
                  I will give you your father's
                  sword.
     A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged
     in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to
     come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts
     downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Give me my father's sword, and
                  I'll cut out your heart.
     Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt
     of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps
     from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                  Fool.   Like your father.
     Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled
     jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles
     on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan,
     inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags
     him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open,
     the jailer reacts with surprise, and...
                                                   CUT TO:
50   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              50
     The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy
     door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the
     jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He
     looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the
     OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows.

51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51

     He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con-
     verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell
     doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands
     reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat.
     He shudders, leaps free. And continues.

     D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated,
     no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward
     him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked
     figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of
     sullen jailers.
     D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                           49.

52   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                       52
     D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret-
     inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor
     ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is
     escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and
     toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as
     the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear-
     some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France.

     D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside.
     The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to
     join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal
     and the cloaked figure now behind it.

53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53

     The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu
     smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner,
     ignored for the moment.
                             RICHELIEU
               I have an errand that requires
               your singular talents.

     The figure rises. The hood falls back... revealing the
     unforgettable features of Milady de Winter. She answers
     the Cardinal's smile with a seductive expression.
                             MILADY
               I was beginning to think you'd
               forgotten me.
                              RICHELIEU
               Forget you?   Impossible.
     Richelieu and Milady share a look of intimacy, two vipers
     from the same pit.

54   OUTSIDE DOOR                                                54

     D'Artagnan slips closer, reaches for the handle, finds it
     unlocked. He opens the door a fraction, holds an ear
     close...


55   BACK TO SCENE                                               55
     Richelieu produces a sealed document from his sleeve,
     and hands it to Milady.

                             RICHELIEU
               Carry this to the Duke of
               Buckingham.

                         (impressed)
                  You did it. An alliance with
                  Buckingham.
                                RICHELIEU
                  The King left me no choice. Now
                  that he's come of age, the boy
                  believes he should rule France.
                  Instead of me.

     Rochefort knows what this portends.    He steps from the
     corner.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  You're going to go through with
                  ... everything?
                                RICHELIEU
                         (silences him with
                          a glance)
                  Yes. Everything.
                         (to Milady)
                  You're to leave for Calais at
                  once. A ship called the
                  Persephone will carry you to
                  England. It sails Tuesday,
                  midnight. I want Buckingham's
                  signature next to mine before the
                  King's birthday. Friday.
                                MILADY
                  Consider it done.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And doing so, shall earn you the
                  gratitude of... a King.

     Richelieu's not talking about Louis.    He's talking about
     himself.

                                                     CUT TO:

56   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                                56

     D'Artagnan leaps back from the door as it opens, head
     down, shuffles to join the retinue of jailers as they
     RETURN TO VIEW. Milady, unrecognizable behind her cloak,
     steps into the corridor, the retinue escorts her forward.
     D'Artagnan falls into place, eyes down, eager for escape.
     Just then: a hand slams down upon his shoulder.
     D'Artagnan looks up into the face of Captain Rochefort.

                                                            51.

57   EXT. BASTILLE - MILADY'S COACH                               57
     Exiting.
                                                CUT TO:

58   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                        58

     D'Artagnan lands with a thud at Richelieu's feet.
     Rochefort hisses:
                              ROCHEFORT
                On your knees.

     When d'Artagnan fails to respond, Rochefort gives him a
     mighty kick. D'Artagnan scrambles into the correct
     posture of supplication. Rochefort continues:

                              ROCHEFORT
                This is the boy who killed
                Jussac.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can explain that --
                               ROCHEFORT
                Silence!
     Rochefort punches d'Artagnan in the head, knocking him to
     the floor. The Cardinal frowns.

                             RICHELIEU
                Rochefort. Violence solves
                nothing. Leave him to me.
     D'Artagnan reacts to the Cardinal's reasonable tone.
     Rochefort makes a sullen exit. The Cardinal smiles.
                                RICHELIEU
                Please.    Sit down.
     D'Artagnan reacts with perceptible awe, as if seeing his
     first movie star. He sits in a finely brocaded chair,
     looks at the Cardinal, an apparition in red. The Cardinal
     speaks, his manner casual, friendly.
                              RICHELIEU
                How much did you hear?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (busted)
                Not a word, Your Eminence. I
                stepped from my cell for a breath
                of air, and became lost in the
                corridors, it's dark as you know,
                but then I saw a light up ahead,
                the light over your door, I...

     Richelieu smiles, dismisses d'Artagnan's tale with a
     wave of his hand.

                                RICHELIEU
                  You may have many talents, my
                  young friend. But guile is not
                  one of them. Do you have a name?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  D'Artagnan.

                                RICHELIEU
                  I've heard that name before.   Are
                  you a Gascon?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes, Your Eminence.
                               RICHELIEU
                  Tell me. What brought you to
                  Paris. And don't say 'a horse.'
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I came to join the King's
                  Musketeers.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Bad timing.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  So I've heard.
                                RICHELIEU
                  D'Artagnan, I like you. I could
                  use a capable young man like you
                  in my Guards.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm honored, Your Eminence, but I
                  don't think I would be very
                  popular with the other men. Not
                  after today.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I suppose not. Your heart is set
                  on being a Musketeer.
                         (off his look)
                  When I was your age, I too had
                  dreams of joining the Musketeers.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (surprised)
                  You, Your Eminence?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              53.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Why not? Becoming a Musketeer is
                  the fantasy of every young
                  Frenchman. Or should I say it
                  was...
                         (with seeming
                          kindness, reason)
                  Like the Knights of the Round
                  Table, the Musketeers have
                  outlived their usefulness. They
                  are a thing of the past.
                         (beat)
                  And so have your three friends.
                  Tell me where they are, d'Artagnan,
                  and I will spare your life.

     Richelieu's seeming kindness conceals a heart of ice.
     D'Artagnan sees it now, replies quietly. No longer in
     awe, but in opposition.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm sorry. But I can't tell you
                  what I do not know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  In that case, give my regards to
                  the headsman.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What about my trial?
                                RICHELIEU
                  You've just had it.

     Richelieu turns for the door, means to dismiss him.
     D'Artagnan calls after.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Wait --
                               RICHELIEU
                  Why? Do you object to losing
                  your head?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.   I like it where it is.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Then tell me what I want to know,
                  and perhaps you will keep it there
                  a few years longer.
                         (beat)
                  Where are the three Musketeers?
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                              54.

58   CONTINUED:    (3)                                              58
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  I don't know.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And if you did?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (after a beat)
                  I wouldn't tell you.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I admire your courage, young man.
                  You might have made a fine
                  Musketeer after all.

     Richelieu opens the door.       Rochefort waits on the other
     side.
                                RICHELIEU
                  But we'll never know, will we?
     Rochefort steps into the room, grabs d'Artagnan roughly
     by the arm, hurls him from the chair to the floor. This
     time Richelieu does not utter protest. Instead, he
     turns to the Captain, commands:
                                RICHELIEU
                  Find the three Musketeers and kill
                  them.
                                ROCHEFORT
                  They'll be dead by dawn.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A comforting thought. Good night,
                  d'Artagnan. Enjoy it. Morning
                  comes quickly.

     With that, Cardinal Richelieu sweeps into the dark.       HOLD
     ON d'Artagnan for a beat. History's pawn.

                                                    CUT TO:

59   EXT. BASTILLE - MARKET SQUARE - DAY                            59

     BELLS TOLL. A motley crowd gathers around the execution
     scaffold, held back by men-at-arms. A hooded executioner
     mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a
     PRIEST. The Priest wears a black cassock and a broad
     black sombrero. The executioner, a large man, raises
     his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his
     finger. Razor-sharp. The executioner holds up his
     bloody thumb.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

59   CONTINUED:                                                59
     The crowd roars approval. And turns to regard the day's
     victim as he is rolled INTO VIEW.

     D'Artagnan stands, half-naked, his hands bound behind him,
     in a horse-drawn cart. The driver turns the cart, begins
     a circuit of the square. The blood-thirsty crowd cheers
     and jeers at d'Artagnan. But d'Artagnan keeps his head
     high. If he must die, he will die with dignity.

60   TOWER OF BASTILLE                                         60

     Rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square.
     Richelieu appears beside him.

                                ROCHEFORT
                  Milady left at midnight.   By
                  private coach.
                                RICHELIEU
                  A remarkable woman. The most
                  beautiful I've ever known. And
                  the deadliest. Which would
                  explain my attraction.
                         (peering down at
                          the scene)
                  How is our young daredevil holding
                  up?

                                ROCHEFORT
                  He's wishing he'd never heard of
                  the Musketeers.
     Down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. A man-
     at-arms drops the tailgate, d'Artagnan steps down. He is
     taken into the custody of a CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS, and
     several men-at-arms carrying muskets.

61   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             61

     The Cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance
     from the square. The Guards who attend it have wandered
     off to watch the festivities. The coachman remains,
     seated on top, braiding his whip. Suddenly, a gloved hand
     grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.

62   SCAFFOLD                                                  62

     D'Artagnan is led by the Captain of the Guards up the
     stairs to the execution platform. The executioner and
     the Priest wait patiently above. D'Artagnan sees the
     bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales.
     The Priest mutters comfort:
                                                (CONTINUED)

                                                             56.

62   CONTINUED:                                                        62
                                PRIEST
                  Fear not, my son...

     D'Artagnan regards the Priest whose face is hidden be-
     neath the brim of his broad black hat. He holds a
     large Bible in his hands.

                                PRIEST
                  For we are with you, always.
     The Priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks.         It
     is Aramis. He whispers:
                                ARAMIS
                  All for one, and one for all...

     D'Artagnan's heart soars. He turns to face the execu-
     tioner. Porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Prepare the prisoner.
     Porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'Artagnan in a
     threatening manner. He takes him by the scruff of the
     neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. The
     crowd goes wild.
                                PORTHOS
                         (whispers into his
                          ear)
                  Don't worry, boy. You won't
                  feel a thing.
     The Captain of the Guards gives Aramis a suspicious look.
                                CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Where is Father Rostand today?

                                ARAMIS
                  The good father is... all tied up.

                                 CAPTAIN OF THE GUARDS
                  Very well.   Proceed.
     Porthos nods.


63   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                     63
     Meanwhile, on the perimeter of the square, two figures
     ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. A CLOSER
     look reveals Queen Anne and Constance. They ride through
     the city, towards the countryside beyond. But their
     progress has led them here. Anne frowns at the spectacle.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                  Barbarism.

                  Men call it justice.

                                ANNE
                  Are you surprised?
     She replies   with contempt, reins her horse away from the
     square, the   crowd, the executioner's axe. But Constance
     freezes in   place, eyes wide. As d'Artagnan, upon the
     cart, rolls   INTO VIEW.
                               CONSTANCE
                  It's him.

     For just a moment, their eyes lock. Inestimable space
     between. Constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches
     d'Artagnan. Porthos steps back from d'Artagnan, raises
     his axe. D'Artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a
     silent prayer. That's when screams of panic erupt from
     the crowd. D'Artagnan raises his head to see the source
     of this mayhem.


64   MARKET SQUARE                                                64
     The Cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold,
     scattering the crowd in all directions. Men shout, women
     scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves,
     the coach's THUNDEROUS spinning WHEELS. In the driver's
     seat, clutching the reins in one hand and CRACKING a WHIP
     in the other... is Athos.
     Porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the
     closest men-at-arms. Aramis opens his Bible, pulls out
     a PISTOL, and BLASTS the saber from the hand of the
     Captain of the Guards. A man-at-arms raises his musket
     to shoot the false priest, but d'Artagnan leaps out of
     nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the man-
     at-arms off the scaffold.

     Athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.
                                ATHOS
                         (the usual dour
                          expression, but a
                          hint of levity)
                  Gentlemen, your carriage.
                  Compliments of the Cardinal.

     D'Artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs
     into the air, landing on the seat beside him. Aramis and
     Porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the
     carriage. The roof fabric tears, they drop into the
     plush interior below. Athos CRACKS the WHIP... and the
     stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.

     Constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. As
     the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she thrusts a
     gloved fist into the air, triumphant.
                                 CONSTANCE
                  Yes!

     Athos produces a dagger, cuts the leather ties that bind
     d'Artagnan's wrists.
                                 ATHOS
                  Hold on!

     Athos cracks the whip, driving the horses onward.

     Aramis and Porthos have settled in comfortably.      Porthos
     spies a wicker hamper on the floor.
                                PORTHOS
                  Well, what have we here?

     Porthos lifts the lid. Inside: bottles of wine, champagne,
     and a wide assortment of foods.

                                PORTHOS
                  How considerate of the Cardinal
                  to provide us with a snack.

     Porthos extracts a bottle of wine, grabs a turkey leg.
     Aramis looks about the interior, spies a small ornate
     box.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Hello.

     Aramis opens the box, reacts.        It is filled with gold
     coins, jewelry.
                                ARAMIS
                  How is it that a man of God
                  becomes a man of gold?
                                PORTHOS
                         (looks on, grins)
                  Trinkets for the ladies.
                                 ARAMIS
                  Let's share.

70   STREETS OF PARIS - CARRIAGE                                     70

     Aramis sticks his head through the hole in the fabric
     roof, hands the ornate box to d'Artagnan.
                                ARAMIS
                  Would you be so good as to
                  distribute these? Your generosity
                  will be greatly appreciated.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (open the box, reacts)
                  But...?
                                ARAMIS
                         (to the point)
                  Throw the coins, boy.     The people
                  are hungry.

     D'Artagnan grabs a handful of coins, and tosses them into
     the air. Aramis smiles approval, drops back to the
     carriage interior. Pedestrians see the gold, shout, and
     leap after. Their hurried steps impede the Guards' pro-
     gress, horses rear up, soldiers tumble. But several of
     the Guards manage to avoid the obstacle, pursue the
     carriage with renewed determination. D'Artagnan hears a
     LOUD POPPING sound, ducks.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  They're firing at us!

     Porthos sticks his head INTO VIEW, offers them a bubbling
     bottle of champagne, the source of the popping sound.

                               PORTHOS
                  Champagne?

                                ATHOS
                  You know I prefer wine.
                                PORTHOS
                  Don't go away.

     Porthos ducks down, returns with a new bottle.
                                PORTHOS
                  May I recommend this find
                  Cabernet?
     Porthos hands   the bottle to Athos. Athos hands the reins
     to d'Artagnan.    D'Artagnan struggles with the reins, tries
     to control the   horses. And beams, taking delight from
     every instant   of adventure. Athos SMASHES the top of the
     BOTTLE, drinks   deeply, settles back to enjoy himself.

                                ATHOS
                  Turn right at the next street.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The next right...?
                               ATHOS
                  Turn.
     Athos growls, d'Artagnan jerks at the reins. The carriage
     careens around the corner, tipping on two wheels.

     Porthos looks up from his chest, champagne spilled all
     over his tunic... and a brand new sash.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to Aramis)

     The carriage charges up a steep hill. At the summit, Athos
     tosses aside his bottle, takes the reins from d'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan sighs with relief. Athos yanks the brake
     lever, brings the horses to a halt, and leaps down from
     the driver's seat. D'Artagnan follows. Athos pulls the
     passenger door open, revealing Porthos and Aramis inside.
     Gold coins on the carpet at their feet, food and drink
     between them.

                                ATHOS
                  Gentlemen, this is the end of the
                  line. I hope you had a pleasant
                  ride.
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  Unhitch the horses.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But the Guards.

     D'Artagnan points to the bottom of the hill.       The mounted
     Guards chase after, begin their ascent.
                                 ATHOS
                  Do as I say.
     D'Artagnan hurries to the horses. Porthos and Aramis
     climb from the cab. Porthos emits a contented belch.
                                ATHOS
                         (to Aramis)
                  Your pistol and powder, please.
     Aramis hands Athos a sack of powder, and his pistol.
     Athos tosses the sack into the carriage, takes aim with
     the PISTOL, and SHOOTS it -- igniting the powder inside.

                                 ATHOS
                  Stand back.

     The interior of the Cardinal's carriage bursts into
     flames.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers mount the Cardinal's
     white stallions, race off into the distance. Porthos
     shouts, laughing.

                                PORTHOS
                  I'd give five years of your life

     The Cardinal's face is contorted in fury. He    steps out of
     a horse cart, approaches the charred remains   of his be-
     loved carriage. He stares at the smouldering    ruin for a
     long beat. Rochefort and a company of Guards    stand near-
     by, wait for him to speak. When he does, his    tone is
     measured and calm.

                             RICHELIEU
               One thousand pistoles on each of
               their heads, dead or alive. The
               boy knows our plans.

     Rochefort reacts with surprise.

     D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers rest against tree
     trunks in a hidden glade, polish off the last of the
     Cardinal's food and drink. Their usual cynicism replaced
     by something approaching camaraderie. Aramis smiles as
     d'Artagnan attacks a turkey wing.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               I haven't eaten in three days.
               I guess with all the excitement,
               I forgot.
                             ARAMIS
               Your trip from home has been an
               eventful one.

                             D'ARTAGNAN

               Three days.
                             PORTHOS
               I heard of a d'Artagnan once. He
               was a captain in the Musketeers
               when we were just recruits.
                             D'ARTAGNAN
               He was my father.

                             ARAMIS
               A good man, I'm told.

                             PORTHOS

               familiar about this boy.

                         (sadly)
                  He died when I was nine.
     The mention of the elder d'Artagnan's death casts a pall.
     D'Artagnan continues, tentative, the memory still hurts.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  All my mother would tell me is
                  that he died in the service of
                  the King.

     An uncomfortable silence.     It is Athos who finally speaks:
                                ATHOS
                  D'Artagnan, your father and another
                  Musketeer were ambushed and
                  murdered outside the Louvre.
     D'Artagnan pales, stunned and silent.      He manages a
     broken whisper:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  This other Musketeer -- is he
                  still alive? I'd like to talk
                  to him.
     Athos shakes his head.     Porthos adds:

                                PORTHOS
                  You already have. His name is
                  the Count De Rochefort.
     D'Artagnan isn't listening. He stands suddenly, turns,
     and walks away. He doesn't want the Musketeers to see
     the tears forming in his eyes. Aramis shouts after:

                                ARAMIS
                  D'Artagnan.

     D'Artagnan stands at a flowing stream, wipes the tears
     from his eyes. Aramis appears at his side, offers silent
     comfort, a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.

                                ARAMIS
                  He lives in you.
     That's all the evidence Aramis requires.       D'Artagnan
     pauses to reflect. Then wonders:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And your father?

                                ARAMIS
                  I was orphaned at a young age.
                  The church took me in.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You didn't have one.
                                ARAMIS
                  But I did. He was a great man,
                  a leader of the church. And his
                  example inspired me to dedicate
                  my life to God's service.

     Aramis opens his cloak, reveals a priestly cloth.       A
     secret he carries near to his heart.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  You were a priest...
                                ARAMIS
                  I was a fool.
                         (eyes on the cool
                          water)
                  This great man, this father,
                  betrayed the church, and turned
                  his back on God. To worship power
                  and gold.

                         (quietly)
                  It broke my heart to see it.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  And you became a Musketeer.

                                ARAMIS
                  I joined the Musketeers and a
                  strange thing happened. I got my
                  faith back.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  But who was that man...

                         (turns to face him)
                  All of France knows him. His
                  Eminence, the Cardinal Richelieu.
     D'Artagnan nearly jumps from his boots.

77   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL - DAY                             77
     Richelieu stands on the roof   of the Palais, lost in
     thought.  He looks down and   sees, through the smoke and
     mist, the silent rooftops of   Paris, pointed, innumerable.
     Richelieu turns, and crosses   to an elaborate pigeon coop.
     Servants attach messages to   the legs of carrier pigeons.
     Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, anxious, out of breath.
                                ROCHEFORT
                         (bowing)
                  Your Eminence. The Musketeers
                  have been sighted riding north
                  on the road to Calais.

     Richelieu nods, he already knows.       He picks up one of
     the pigeons, strokes it gently.
                                RICHELIEU
                  Don't worry. Thanks to our winged

                  bounty hunter in France will be

     The three Musketeers gather around d'Artagnan, listen to
     his story. In mid-telling:

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  ... I couldn't hear it clearly,
                  I was standing by the door, the
                  voices were low --

                               PORTHOS
                  Go on.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  The Cardinal sent someone to
                  England. With a secret treaty.
                               ARAMIS
                  What?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He's made an alliance with a man
                  named, Bucking... Buckingham.
     The Musketeers look at each other with alarm.
                                PORTHOS
                  The Duke of Buckingham?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                         (nodding)
                  Do you know him?
                                ARAMIS
                  He rules England the way Richelieu
                  rules France.

                  This messenger and the treaty will
                  prove the Cardinal a traitor. If
                  we can get our hands on them.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  What are we waiting for, let's go.

                               ATHOS
                  Wait.

     Athos stops their exuberant plots and plans with a
     single word. All turn, wonder.
                                ATHOS
                         (as always, the
                          bottom line)
                  Does the Cardinal know you have
                  this information?
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.
                                ATHOS
                  Then he knows we have it too. And
                  he'll do everything in his power
                  to stop us.
                                PORTHOS
                  But with three men trying, one
                  of us might be able to make it.
                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Four.
     Bold words. D'Artagnan matures by leaps and bounds.
     Athos almost smiles.

79   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   79

     Fog drifts across    a lonely stretch of road. Suddenly:
     pounding HOOFBEATS    come over the scene. MUSIC SWELLS.
     And galloping out    of the fog come d'Artagnan and the
     three Musketeers,    riding hell-for-leather. HOLD ON this
     heroic tableau for    a long beat.

80   EXT. BRIDGE ON ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                         80

     Four rough-looking MERCENARIES crouch on a low bridge
     spanning a shallow stream. They are armed with muskets
     and swords. The Mercenaries wait in the darkness, whisper
     eagerly among themselves.

     One of them hisses for silence, all conversation ends.
     And the sound of HOOFBEATS is heard in the distance.
     Faint, but growing closer.
                                MERCENARY
                  Shoot low. We'll need their
                  heads for identification.

     The Mercenaries raise their muskets, take aim. Right on
     cue, four horsemen come THUNDERING out of the mist. But
     just before they reach the bridge, the four horsemen
     break in half -- one pair rides to the left, the other to
     the right. Before the Mercenaries realize what's
     happened, the horsemen ride on either side, splashing
     through the shallow stream. In a flash, they return to
     the road, and race away. Having avoided the bridge
     completely.
     Cursing, the angry Mercenaries whirl about, FIRE at
     d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers as they ride into
     the night. Porthos' merry laugh drifts back to mock them.

81   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                   81
     An overturned wagon lies in the ditch. Beer kegs litter
     the roadway. The wagon's driver, an old FARMER, sits on
     one of the kegs, holding his head. D'Artagnan and the
     Musketeers gallop INTO VIEW, rein their horses to a stop.
                                FARMER
                         (with relief)
                  Thank God for a friendly face.
                  My horse broke loose. Can you
                  help me move these kegs out of
                  the road?
     D'Artagnan starts to dismount.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay on your horse.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  He needs our help.

                                 ATHOS
                  Don't worry.   We'll help him.

     Suddenly: two other men step before the wagon, pointing
     muskets. The ragged Farmer reaches inside his coat, pulls
     out a pistol, makes a smirking request:

                                ARAMIS
                  Gentlemen, I beg you. Please put
                  away your weapons and remove these
                  kegs from the road. We'd prefer
                  to ride on without having to kill
                  you.
     D'Artagnan and the "Farmers" gape at Aramis in surprise.

                                FARMER
                  You're threatening us?

                                PORTHOS
                  It's not a threat, it's a fact.
                  If you don't haul those kegs away,
                  you're dead where you stand.
     The Farmer laughs, contemptuously. He raises his pistol
     and aims it at Porthos' head. But before he can pull the
     trigger, THREE EXPLOSIONS ERUPT from under the cloaks of
     Athos, Porthos and Aramis.
     When the smoke clears, d'Artagnan is startled to see the
     three dead "Farmers" sprawled in the road and the three
     pistols emerging from beneath the cloaks of the
     Musketeers.
                                PORTHOS
                  Mine hit the ground first.
                                ATHOS
                  Mine was taller.
     Aramis swings out of the saddle and begins to perform
     last rites over the bodies. D'Artagnan still can't be-
     lieve what just happened. He turns to Porthos. Porthos
     raises the barrel to his lips and blows away the gunsmoke.

                                PORTHOS
                  There's only one rule, d'Artagnan
                  -- stay alive.

     THUNDER RUMBLES and RAINS begins to fall.

     Present are the INNKEEPER, his wife, a few benighted tra-
     velers and THREE BARMAIDS. They turn as the door flies
     open and the Musketeers and d'Artagnan enter from a RAGING
     STORM. They keep their cloaks drawn about them and wear
     the brims of their hats pulled low to cover their faces.

     The occupants of the inn regard the new arrivals with
     suspicion. Outisde, the STORM BLOWS. D'Artagnan closes
     the heavy door. Fearful, the Innkeeper comes forward to
     meet the four ominous travelers.

                                  INNKEEPER
                  Good evening.

                  I'm sorry but we have little to
                  spare. The Cardinal's Guards were
                  here today. They helped
                  themselves to our food and then
                  refused to pay.

                  In the name of God, I'm sure.
     Porthos is on the lookout for danger. He reaches inside
     his cloak for a weapon and, in doing so, accidentally
     exposes his Musketeer tunic.

                  Musketeers!

     The sound of SLIDING STEEL as Athos, Porthos, Aramis and
     d'Artagnan draw their swords, ready to fight. They stand
     back to back in a circle, ready for attack.

     But there is no attack. Quite the contrary.       The people
     here are thrilled to see them.

                                INNKEEPER

                  Anyone who fights the Cardinal is
                  welcome here.

     The Musketeers lower their swords.

                                ARAMIS
                  I think we've found a home.

     The Musketeers return their swords to their sheathes and
     take off their dripping hats and capes. The pretty
     Barmaids crowd around them to collect their gear and car-
     ry it to the fire.

                                INNKEEPER
                  We don't have much but what we
                  have is yours.

     Porthos rubs his hands together, eager to indulge himself.
     He follows the Barmaids, booming in his loud, friendly
     voice.

                                PORTHOS
                  Ladies, you're in for a treat
                  tonight. Allow me to introduce
                  myself. I'm the Musketeer they
                  call Porthos.
     Porthos beams, waiting for a big response but nothing
     happens. The Barmaids look at each other.
                                PORTHOS
                         (repeating; louder)
                  Porthos.

     Still no response.    Aramis and d'Artagnan hide smiles.
                                ARAMIS
                  It's hard to believe they haven't
                  heard of the great Porthos.
                                PORTHOS
                  Oh, shut up, Aramis.

     The three Barmaids perk up.
                                BARMAIDS
                         (with excitement)
                  Aramis? Did you say Aramis?
     And with that, the three Barmaids desert Porthos and
     scurry across the room to attach themselves to Aramis.
     Porthos shakes his head and flops down in a chair.
                                PORTHOS
                  I don't get it. I just don't
                  get it.

                                                   CUT TO:

                                                             72.

83   INT. TAVERN - NIGHT                                           83
     Moments later.   Porthos regales the Barmaids with a tale.

                             PORTHOS
               I said, 'A Queen is no different
               than a barmaid in the dark. Though
               less... practiced in the arts of
               pleasure...'

     The Barmaids accept his leering compliment with glee.
     But d'Artagnan isn't so sure. Porthos, with two Barmaids,
     bellows a reply.

                             PORTHOS
               If you're going to be a proper
               Musketeer, you'll have to learn
               the manly art of wenching. Right,
               ladies?
     The Barmaids heartily concur. D'Artagnan looks over
     Porthos' shoulder, to the dark-haired Barmaid seen previ-
     ously. Porthos follows his gaze, grins.
                             PORTHOS
               Ahh, very good. Your first
               subject. But you'll need
               instruction. Watch closely.
     Porthos pulls one of the Barmaids to his chest, brings
     her lips toward his.
                             PORTHOS
               The secret to wenching is the
               first kiss. For in that kiss, a
               lasting impression is made. If it
               is weak, she will think you are
               weak. And if it is comical, she
               will think you are a clown. With
               me?
                               D'ARTAGNAN
               Weak... weak.    Comical... clown.

                              PORTHOS
               Very good.   And as a Musketeer is
               never weak,  and only rarely a
               clown, your  first kiss must be all
               the things  that you are. Like
               this...
     Porthos gives the Barmaid a powerful kiss.      He breaks it,
     turns to d'Artagnan with a grin.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                PORTHOS
                  You may speak first if you like,
                  your name, her name, an endearment
                  or two. But words are usually a
                  waste of time.

                                ARAMIS
                  Only if you don't know which words
                  to say.
     All turn to regard Aramis. He'll play along too.
     Porthos reacts with delight. D'Artagnan with interest.
     Aramis continues:
                                ARAMIS
                  Words may make a more lasting
                  impression than a thousand of
                  Porthos' kisses.
                                BARMAID
                         (still reeling)
                  Not likely.
                                ARAMIS
                  I'll demonstrate. Please.   Sit
                  beside me.
     Aramis' courtly behavior is as out of place in these en-
     virons as it is persuasive. The Barmaid slips from
     Porthos' lap, sits down on the bench beside him.
     Aramis does not touch her. He simply looks into her
     eyes... and begins to speak.
                                ARAMIS
                  'Shall I compare thee to a
                     summer's day?
                  Thou art more lovely and more
                     temperate:
                  Rough winds do shake the darling
                     buds of May,
                  And summer's leash hath all too
                     short a date;
                  Sometime too hot the eye of heaven
                     shines,
                  And often is his gold complexion
                     dimmed;
                  And every fair from fair sometimes
                     declines,
                  By chance, or nature's changing
                     course untrimmed;
                  But thy eternal summer shall not
                     fade.

                  Nor lose possession of that fair
                     thou owest,
                  Nor shall death brag thou

                  So long lives this, and this gives
                     life to thee.'

     The Barmaid, once skeptical, sits silently. Her face
     covered with tears. Aramis pauses, almost embarrassed by
     the outcome. He turns to d'Artagnan, cites:

                                 ARAMIS
                  Shakespeare.
                                PORTHOS
                  That's cheating.
     The Barmaid on his lap disagrees.

                                BARMAID
                  It's beautiful.
     D'Artagnan looks at the dark-haired Barmaid across the
     room. Porthos urges him on.
                                PORTHOS
                  Come on, d'Artagnan. We haven't
                  got all night.

     D'Artagnan steps forward. The dark-haired Barmaid sees
     him coming and smiles. D'Artagnan stands before her,
     hesitates, not sure where to start. Then, remembering as
     best he can:
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  'Shall I compare thee to a summer's
                    day?
                  Thou are move lovely and more
                     tempest, er, more tempered...'
                         (beat)
                  Ahh, to hell with it --

     D'Artagnan takes the Barmaid into his arms, delivers a
     powerful kiss. As previously demonstrated. Porthos and
     Aramis smile proudly. The Barmaids cheer.

                                PORTHOS
                  The boy's a natural.

                  So little time, so much to learn.

     D'Artagnan drains his flagon, indicates Athos sitting at
     a table by himself, scowling, working on his third bottle
     of Burgundy.

                                ARAMIS
                  In all the years I've know him...
                  I have never seen Athos smile.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Why is he sitting by himself?
                                PORTHOS
                  Athos takes his drinking seriously.
                  Ignore him. He'll be his usual
                  warm, charming self by morning.
                         (calls out)
                  Service! My lap is cold!
     A Barmaid scurries INTO   VIEW. Porthos grabs her by the
     waist, adds the Barmaid   to the one already sitting on his
     lap. The chair breaks    beneath them, and all three go
     sprawling on the floor,   laughing heartily.

84   ATHOS                                                         84

     He remains lost in drink. D'Artagnan appears beside him.
     He hides his concern behind a cheerful attitude.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  Come join us.
     Athos pulls d'Artagnan down with a dark smile.     He fills
     his flagon for him.

                                ATHOS
                  You fight like a Musketeer. Let's
                  see if you can drink like one.

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'll drink anything you put in
                  front of me.

                         (raising his flagon)
                  What shall we drink to?

     D'Artagnan notices the dark-haired Barmaid eyeing him
     across the room.

                  Love?

     The word nearly makes Athos grimace. He stares at
     d'Artagnan for a long beat, then beyond. As if to look
     into another time and place. Finally:

                               ATHOS
                  Love.

                  Would you like to hear a story,
                  d'Artagnan? A love story?
     Athos' voice reveals unexpected vulnerability, the pain
     he keeps inside. D'Artagnan is fascinated, moved. He
     nearly whispers:

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                  Yes.
     Athos takes a long pull from the bottle of burgundy,
     wipes the blood red wine from his lips.
                                ATHOS
                  I once knew a man... one of the
                  Counts of Berry. My native
                  province. When the good Count was
                  about your age, he fell in love
                  with a visitor from Paris. A
                  breathtaking girl of seventeen.
                  She was more than beautiful,
                  d'Artagnan. She was...
                  intoxicating. And this man, the
                  poor idiot, he married her.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Isn't that what people do when
                  they fall in love?
                                ATHOS
                         (sharply)
                  Be quiet and listen.
                         (beat)
                  The Count took her to his castle
                  and made her the first lady of the
                  province. They were happy for a
                  time, as happy as a man and a
                  woman can be. Then one day, while
                  riding in the woods, the girl was
                  thrown from her horse, and knocked
                  unconscious. The Count hurried to
                  help her. Her dress was torn.

                  gold band in the shape of a
                  serpent. It was the only article
                  of clothing she refused to remove.
                  The Count's curiosity got the best
                  of him. He reached over and slid
                  down the gold band. He saw
                  something on her arm... something
                  she'd kept hidden 'til then...

     D'Artagnan reacts with shock.
                                ATHOS
                  The Count's angel turned out to be
                  a murderess who escaped the
                  Executioner's blade. She swore
                  that she loved him. Swore that
                  she had changed. And if he would
                  just keep her secret, they would
                  live a long life together.
     Athos pauses, imagines that life.      The Count and his
     angel.
                                ATHOS
                  But the Count was young and he was
                  stupid. He was tormented by the
                  ridicule of his social class. And
                  so he rejected her. For her lies
                  and for her past.
                         (beat)
                  And turned her over to the
                  authorities to be executed for the
                  crime.

     Athos now turns his unflinching gaze on d'Artagnan.
                                ATHOS
                  But you see... his heart did not
                  agree.  The Count soon realized
                  what she had meant to him. And
                  what he had done.

                  That his... betrayal was far
                  greater than her own.
                         (beat)
                  Soon after he foreswore the
                  society that shaped him. Gave up
                  his title. And was never seen
                  again.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                  He loved her.

                                ATHOS
                  He killed her. It seemed like the
                  same thing after a while.

     HOLD ON Athos for a long time.       As he gathers up his pain,
     and puts it back again.
     Athos SMASHES open another BOTTLE. But the story has
     made d'Artagnan quite sober and a little sick to his
     stomach. He refuses another drink.
                                 ATHOS
                  Good.   More for me.
                                PORTHOS
                  Aramis -- play something with some
                  blood in it! I feel like dancing!
     Aramis launches into something appropriate. Porthos and
     a Barmaid get up and begin a festive folk dance.
     Porthos is damned good. His joie de vivre is infectious
     and soon everyone in the inn is clapping and encouraging
     him. Every once in awhile, another WEAPON -- a dagger or
     something -- drops out of Porthos' clothing and hits the
     floor with a CLATTER.

     That's when Porthos, dancing with abandon, spins out of
     control, trips and falls on Athos' table, crushing it to
     the floor.

     Porthos lies in the wreckage, staring up. Athos, totally
     unperturbed, looks down and offers him the bottle.

                                PORTHOS
                  Care to dance, Athos?
                                ATHOS
                  Only if I can lead.

     Porthos blinks in amazement at Athos' grim face, then
     breaks out laughing.
                                 PORTHOS
                  Aramis!   Athos made a joke!

     The Innkeeper comes down the stairs wearing a nightshirt
     and a sleepy expression.

                            INNKEEPER
              Excuse me, gentlemen.

                            D'ARTAGNAN

              You told me to wake you at dawn.

                             ATHOS
              Well?

                             INNKEEPER
              It's dawn.
     They turn in disbelief to the shuttered windows. Sure
     enough. Sunlight is peeking in through the cracks.

87   EXT. RURAL LANDSCAPE - DAY                                   87
     The sun rises, casts long shadows across a sparkling dew-
     wet field. D'Artagnan and the Musketeers ride INTO
     FRAME, continuing their journey to Calais. D'Artagnan
     squints ahead, wincing with every bump. Porthos grins.
                            PORTHOS
              Beautiful morning, eh, d'Artagnan?

     D'Artagnan is terribly hung-over from the night's
     carousing. He looks like he could puke at any moment.
     So that's exactly why Porthos shouts to him and says...

                              PORTHOS
              You know,   d'Artagnan, it's not a
              good idea   to travel on an empty
              stomach.    You really should have
              had a big   portion of those sheep's
              brains...

     D'Artagnan covers his mouth.    Porthos laughs good-
     naturedly.
                            D'ARTAGNAN
              My head feels like it's filled
              with the King's marching band.
              Would you please stop whistling?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  Well someone is.

                                PORTHOS
                         (to others)
                  The Barmaid's kiss left him dizzy.
                                ARAMIS
                  I hear it too. It sounds like...
                                ATHOS
                         (knows immediatley)
                  A connon ball.

     Athos is cut off by an EAR-PIERCING WHISTLE as a CANNON
     BALL drops out of the sky and STRIKES the ground nearby,
     sending up a tremendous EXPLOSION.
                                PORTHOS
                  I hate cannon balls.

     Another BALL EXPLODES into the ground in front of them.
     Their horses rear up in fear, threatening to dump them
     out of their saddles. As the Musketeers and d'Artagnan
     struggle to control their horses, they look back and see
     an old castle atop a distant hill.
     A group of men operate two rusted cannons, left over from
     some long-forgotten war.
     The Musketeers barely calm their horses, when another
     BALL comes SCREAMING their way, IMPACTING a few feet
     away. As dirt rains upon them:

                                ARAMIS
                         (to d'Artagnan)
                  How's your head now?

                                D'ARTAGNAN
                  I'm beginning to wish the Cardinal
                  had chopped if off.

                                ATHOS
                  Stay with us, and you just might
                  get your wish.
     Athos spurs his horse across the field, d'Artagnan and
     the Musketeers follow. But they discover crude battle-
     ments in their path. Athos changes direction, sees six
     horsemen waiting for them in the near distance. He
     changes direction again, as the horsemen charge after.

                                                     (CONTINUED)

     They ride as fast their mounts will carry them. A cross-
     roads up ahead. Athos sizes up the situation, shouts
     command.
                                ATHOS
                  Split in half! D'Artagnan rides
                  with me!

     D'Artagnan nods, thrilled to go with Athos.
                                ARAMIS
                  We'll see you in Calais!
                               ATHOS
                  Or hell!

     Athos and d'Artagnan take off in one direction, Porthos
     and Aramis in the other. The pursuing horsemen soon
     race INTO VIEW, break in half to give chase.

     screens, we discover Anne reclining in a large tiled bath,
     Constance attending. Constance replenishes the bath with
     pitchers of hot water drawn from a boiling cauldron.
     In mid-conversation, as confidantes and friends:

                  But how, your Majesty? How can

                  I am.

     Anne turns to Constance, soap and water swirl about her
     naked body. She wonders:

                  Your Majesty, forgive me.

                                RICHELIEU
                  I need your help. And could not
                  in good conscience wait another
                  minute.

                                ANNE
                  You want my help?
                               RICHELIEU
                  Yes.

                                ANNE
                  On what matter?
                                RICHELIEU
                  Your... husband.
                                ANNE
                         (remembering
                          Richelieu's last
                          encounter with Louis)
                  Your King.

     Richelieu allows the jest, remains silent, watchful.
     Anne resumes, chooses her words with care.
                                ANNE
                  Of course. As Your Eminence has
                  been kind enough to advise me...
                         (nods assent)
                  It's the least I can do.

     Richelieu reacts with quiet pleasure.    He steps closer.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I am worried about the King's...
                  happiness.
                                ANNE
                  What do you mean?

                                RICHELIEU
                  The Huguenot rebellion, occupation
                  in the Antilles and Cayenne. The
                  coming war with France. These are
                  not the usual hobbies of youth.
                               ANNE
                  No.

                                RICHELIEU
                  And now he wishes to postpone his
                  birthday celebration.
                               ANNE
                  Why?

                                RICHELIEU
                  He feels it is not... appropriate.
                                ANNE
                  It sounds as though he is
                  concerned with more important
                  matters.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Which is exactly why we must
                  celebrate.
                         (off her look)
                  To show the world that the King of
                  France is strong enough to face
                  any enemy on any field. To show
                  France... that he is King.
                         (beat)
                  He will listen to you. If you
                  will speak.
     Richelieu makes his case with forceful eloquence, seeming
     loyalty. Anne considers, replies, noncommittal:
                                ANNE
                  I will speak to him.
     Anne senses hidden agenda, intrigues below the surface.
     The conversation's conspiratorial tone begins to disturb
     her.

                                ANNE
                  Now, if you'll excuse me, I...
                               RICHELIEU
                  Of course.
     Anne nods, turns back toward the chambers.       Richelieu
     calls after.

                                RICHELIEU
                  Your Majesty?
                         (off her look)
                  Please understand that I do not
                  underestimate the value of your
                  assistance.

                  And that I wish for you to
                  consider -- in fact, to know --
                  all that you and I might
                  accomplish. Together.
                         (quietly, as if
                          to justify)
                  For France.
     Richelieu steps away, his red cape swirling behind him.
     Anne feels a chill, pulls her robe more tightly about
     her body.

     from his encounter with the Queen. Louis looks up,
     greets him with displeasure.


92   INT. THRONE ROOM AND GREAT HALL                                 92
     Louis watches from a balcony. Richelieu appears, fresh
     from his encounter with the Queen.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I'm sorry to be late, Your
                  Majesty, but I was wrestling with
                  an important matter of state.

     Richelieu never allows the mask to slip. Even for an
     instant. Louis glances at the throne room, the increasing
     number of Cardinal's Guards on duty. They make him feel
     uncomfortable. Louis speaks with renewed determination.

                                LOUIS
                  Why is it I don't see any of my
                  Musketeers?

                                RICHELIEU
                  I'm afraid... that's impossible.

                  They have become outlaws. They
                  are terrorizing the countryside,
                  robbing and killing innocent
                  people.

     Louis can't believe it.

                                LOUIS
                  There must be some mistake.

                                RICHELIEU
                  No mistake. I have reports from
                  the local constables involved.

     Richelieu, ever prepared, produces a sheaf of papers. No
     doubt counterfeit. But Louis has no way of knowing. He
     takes the papers into his hands, reacts with sadness.
                                  LOUIS
                  Musketeers...
                                RICHELIEU
                  They are better off disbanded.
     Louis turns back to the balcony, the soldiers marching
     below. His mood glum and lonely. He sighs, moves on to
     another matter of business.

                                LOUIS
                  Your Eminence, I've been hearing
                  some very troubling rumors about
                  you.

     Richelieu nods, not the least bit concerned.
                                RICHELIEU
                  There are so many to choose from.
                  Is it the one about my alleged
                  alliance with Buckingham? Let's
                  see if I remember it correctly.
                  While the English attack from
                  without, I'll undermine the throne
                  from within -- depose you -- and
                  become sovereign of France myself.
                  That rumor, Your Majesty?

     Richelieu smiles, his face a mask of innocence.
                                LOUIS
                  It does seem rather farfetched.

                  when we appear together at your

                                LOUIS
                  I've been thinking about that. A

                  celebrate the birth of their King
                  at a time like this.
                                LOUIS
                  I'm not so eager.
                                RICHELIEU
                  I have an idea. Why don't you
                  discuss the matter with your
                  Queen?
     Louis looks up, wonders. As Richelieu draws him deeper
     into his spider's strategems.

     Porthos and Aramis ride hard, look back over their
     shoulders. They crest the top of a bluff, rein their
     horses to a stop. They can afford to rest for a moment.
     Their pursuit is at least a mile behind them.
                                ARAMIS
                  My horse will not survive another

                  Here's just the thing.     A nice,
                  relaxing boat ride.
     At the bottom of the hill: a crude ferry lands at the
     bank of a swift, choppy river.

                                                       CUT TO:

94   EXT. RIVER AND FERRY LANDING - DAY                                94

     The ferry is an open flatboat -- a wooden platform, about
     fifteen-by-twenty feet. It travels from one shore to the
     other by means of a ferry rope. Transport is slow, the
     trip to the other shore takes nearly five minutes.

     As Porthos and Aramis arrive, the flatboat is just re-
     turning, piloted by its FERRYMAN, a hunched and weather-
     beaten gnome. Four passengers wait to be carried across
     -- TWO GENTLEMAN CAVALIERS on horseback, and a country
     WOMAN and her child. As the flatboat enters its slip,
     the two Cavaliers urge their horses on board, rudely
     jostling the Woman and her child to the rear.
     The Ferryman, an experienced boot-licker, bows and
     scrapes to the Cavaliers, collects the coins they toss
     to his way.

                                FERRYMAN
                  A privilege to carry you on my
                  humble boat...
     The Ferryman turns a greedy eye on the Woman and child.
                                  FERRYMAN
                  Two pistoles.

                                WOMAN
                  But I only have one. Couldn't
                  my child ride free? She's so
                  small...
                                FERRYMAN

                          demanding)
                  Two pistoles.
     A courtly voice intervenes.

                                ARAMIS
                  Put away your money, madame. You
                  and your child will cross the
                  river under our protection. For
                  free.

     All turn to regard Aramis on horseback, Porthos at his
     side. The Woman reacts with grateful surprise. The
     Ferryman is outraged, spittle flies as he curses and
     protests.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Nobody rides for free! Under
                  your protection bloody well
                  indeed! I'll teach you a thing
                  or two about protection! Apple-
                  cheeked young fools!! -- Just who
                  do you think you are!!

                          simply)
                  Musketeers.
     Two two Cavaliers react to the word. The Ferryman does,
     too -- into cringing, obedient servant.
                                FERRYMAN
                  Musketeers? Well, why didn't you
                  say so? Of course you'll ride for
                  free. I insist on it. This way,
                  pretty madame. My what a lovely

                               PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis takes Porthos by the shoulder and turns him so
     he can see their pursuers pouring over the top of the
     hill on their horses.
                               PORTHOS
                  We sail!

     And with that, Porthos takes the sharp edge of his boom-
     erang and brings it down on the dock rope. The rope
     splits and the ferryboat lurches away from the dock.


95   HILL AND SHORE                                             95
     The pursuers charge down the hill and ride to the end of
     the dock but they're too late. Porthos and Aramis have
     gotten away.

                                                          91.
96   FLATBOAT                                                   96
     Porthos laughs and taunts the angry pursuers. Aramis
     ties scarves around the horses' eyes to blindfold them
     for the crossing. Then he turns around and sees what
     Aramis is already seeing -- the two Cavaliers watch them
     with keen interest.
                             FIRST CAVALIER
               You're those Musketeers everyone's
               been looking for.

                              PORTHOS
                Popularity has its price.

     The First Cavalier smiles, produces a flask.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                I have some excellent brandy here.
                Would you gentlemen care to drink
                a toast with us to the Cardinal?
                              PORTHOS
                We'd be happy to.
     Porthos produces a bottle from under his cloak.
                              PORTHOS
                If you'll drink one with us to
                the King.
                              SECOND CAVALIER
                But the only King we recognize...
                is the Cardinal.
                              ARAMIS
                There are those who would call
                that treason.
                              FIRST CAVALIER
                Happily, no such objections have
                been raised... here.
                               PORTHOS
                All right.   I'll object.

                              SECOND CAVALIER
                I'm listening.

                              PORTHOS
                Let's see. You are, by your dress
                and by your manner, members of a
                bone-lazy class of servile ninnyhammers
                whose slavish allegiance to His
                Eminence the Cardinal is as that
                of a dog who likes nothing better
                than to sniff today where he has
                peed the day before.

                  Ninnyhammers.
                                PORTHOS
                  I was momentarily inspired.

     The Cavaliers are not amused. The first replies in
     measured tones, his lips white with fury.

                                 FIRST CAVALIER
                  May I reply?
                                ARAMIS
                         (courtly)
                  By all means.
                                FIRST CAVALIER
                  Better to be a dog in the service
                  of a great master, than a beef-
                  witted moron so dazzled by the
                  throne that he does not see the
                  true nature of the foolish boy
                  who wobbles atop it. Which is to
                  say, that most muddy-brained of
                  all men... a Musketeer.
     The Cavaliers have already pulled out their swords.
     Porthos and Aramis now reach for their own. Porthos
     deadpans:
                                PORTHOS
                  Maybe there's something  about us
                  that just pisses people  off. At
                  least I'd like to think  so. It's
                  too bad we can only kill  them
                  once.

97   FIGHT                                                       97

     The middle of a river on a rocking flatboat is not the
     best place for a duel. But the combatants make the most
     of it. Slipping, sliding, and falling. They attack with
     everything they've got. The Cavaliers are excellent
     swordsmen. And, as if that were not enough, the
     Musketeers have an additional disadvantage -- they must
     keep the Woman and child clear of the flashing blades.
                                                  (CONTINUED)

                                                              93.

97   CONTINUED:                                                     97
     Porthos drives his opponent about the flatboat with a
     devilish grin, chases him between -- and at one point,
     over -- blindfolded horses.
     Aramis duels with the expected artistry, gradually re-
     ducing his opponent to tatters. At one juncture, the
     child loses her footing, slides toward the low end of
     the flatboat, the deep river beyond. Aramis executes a
     neat sidestep, stops the child's desperate progress with
     one arm while continuing to do battle with the other.
     He returns child to Mother with a grin, continues.

     The two Cavaliers are soon vanquished, groaning on the
     flatboat deck. Porthos and Aramis meet at the middle,
     breathless. Porthos complains:

                                PORTHOS
                  I've been called a lot of things
                  in my time...
                                ARAMIS
                         (eyes on the
                          opposite shore)
                  Porthos...
                                PORTHOS
                  But beef-witted is a little more
                  than I can stand, not to mention
                  unfair...
                                  ARAMIS
                  Porthos...
                                  PORTHOS
                  What?
     Aramis indicates the opposite shore as the flatboat
     approaches it. There, waiting patiently, swords and
     muskets already drawn... is a patrol of Cardinal's
     Guards.

                                  ARAMIS
                  Can you swim?
                                 PORTHOS
                          (doesn't like the
                           sound of this)
                  No.   My horse can.
                                  ARAMIS
                  That'll do.

                                  PORTHOS
                  But...?

97   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              97
     Aramis hurries to    his horse, takes off the blindfold.
     Porthos grumbles    after, follows suit. They leap atop
     their mounts, the    horses slip upon the wet deck as they
     guide them to the    edge.
                                ARAMIS
                  You go first and I'll watch your
                  progress.
                                 PORTHOS
                  No, no.   Please. After you.

     Stalemate. Then, they can't help it, Aramis and Porthos
     grin. Life is an adventure, lived to the fullest. They
     count...

                                ARAMIS AND PORTHOS
                  One, two -- three!
     And with that, as the Woman and child, the Ferryman look
     on, Aramis and Porthos guide their horses into the raging
     river. The Woman whispers after:
                                 WOMAN
                  Thank you.   God speed.
     Porthos manages a wink as he floats into the distance.


98   ON SHORE                                                       98
     The Cardinal's Guards react with anger and disbelief.


99   RIVER                                                          99
     A wild ride down the ROARING RIVER. Porthos clinging to
     his horse for dear life. Aramis keeping an eye on his
     fellow Musketeer... and the deep rapids up ahead.
     Through twists and turns, walls of white water, huge
     boulders, and gyrating whirlpools... Aramis and Porthos
     finally reach a quiet pool, a leafy shore beyond. They
     lead their horses from the water, step toward dry land...
     and see yet another (or perhaps the same) patrol of
     Cardinal's Guards. Waiting, swords drawn, for their
     arrival.
     Porthos looks down at his latest sash -- destroyed like
     the others. Aramis draws his saber, mutters.

                                ARAMIS
                  A nice relaxing boat ride...
                                                     (CONTINUED)

                                                                95.

99    CONTINUED:                                                      99
      And with that, Aramis and Porthos charge towards the
      Guards.

                                                      CUT TO:
100   EXT. DENSE FOREST - DAY                                         100

      Cool, clear water. WIDEN to reveal d'Artagnan and Athos
      at a shallow pond, watering their horses. The forest
      around them is dark and primeval.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Do you think we've lost them?
                                 ATHOS
                   They'll catch up eventually.

      To the point, as always. D'Artagnan pauses to look at
      their beautiful surroundings, remembers:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   My father used to hunt in a forest
                   like this. He promised to take me
                   on my tenth birthday. I don't know
                   why he picked that year. Something
                   about a boy becoming a man. I'd
                   lay in bed at night and imagine it,
                   just the two of us. But he died
                   before I could go with him.
      Athos is unmoved, or so it would seem.       He replies with
      quiet cynicism:
                                 ATHOS
                   Well. You have your boyhood wish
                   at last. The dark forest. The
                   thrill of the hunt. The nearness
                   of death.
      Only d'Artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd be proud to die for my King.
                                 ATHOS
                   I just wanted to save you from the
                   life of a Musketeer. You don't
                   have to go looking for experience,
                   d'Artagnan. It'll find you soon
                   enough. And when it does -- it
                   will mark you forever.

      Athos rides into the forest.    D'Artagnan hurries to
      follow.

                                                      CUT TO:

                                                          96.

101   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                         101
      Athos leads d'Artagnan through the forest. Sunbeams
      shoot down through thick branches like golden bars. A
      pastoral setting, almost peaceful. And then: THUNDERING
      HOOFBEATS. Athos and d'Artagnan turn in surprise, see
      SIX HORSEMEN CRASHING through the glade.


102   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             102
      Athos and d'Artagnan GALLOP through the dense forest.
      The horesmen FIRE PISTOLS as they ride. A SHOT grazes
      d'Artagnan's shoulder, he staggers, retains his mount.
      Athos leads them up a hillside, a series of boulders at
      the top. The climb is fast and treacherous, GUNFIRE all
      around them. Athos' horse is struck by a bullet, stag-
      gers forward... and collapses just as they reach the
      crest. D'Artagnan leaps off his horse, takes cover with
      Athos behind the boulders. Athos takes aim, FIRES a
      SHOT, and kills one of the horsemen below. The others
      curse, leap from their mounts, seek cover. SHOTS WHIZ
      back and forth like angry hornets.
      Stalemate, but not for long. They are badly outnumbered.
      The horsemen creep slowly up the hillside, from tree to
      tree. Athos turns to d'Artagnan as he reloads:
                              ATHOS
                I'll hold them off for as long as
                I can. Go on without me.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I can't leave you here. Not like
                this.

                              ATHOS
                Ride to Calais and stop the
                Cardinal's agent.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Athos... I can't.

      Athos points his pistol at d'Artagnan.
                              ATHOS
                Go, or I'll kill you myself.

      A few days ago, d'Artagnan would have obeyed without
      question. Fearful, if nothing else. But not here, not
      now.

                               D'ARTAGNAN
                A duel then.

102   CONTINUED:                                                     102
                                 ATHOS
                   You're insane.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   We never finished the first.

                                 ATHOS
                   All right. I'll toss a coin.
                   Tails I stay, heads you remain.
                   Agreed?

      D'Artagnan nods. Athos FIRES off another SHOT. He

      hand. And looks between.

      Heads. D'Artagnan is to remain.       Athos looks up without
      missing a beat.
                                   ATHOS
                   Tails.    I stay.

      Athos returns the coin to his doublet without giving
      d'Artagnan a chance to see.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   But...?
      Athos reloads, FIRES below. D'Artagnan recognizes the
      kindness he has received. That Athos cannot fully express
      it. And that there is no use arguing with him.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   At least take my pistol.

      He gives it to Athos.      They clasp hands.
                                 ATHOS
                          (gruff; yet proud)
                   Don't let us down... Musketeer.
      There are tears in d'Artagnan's eyes.       He knows Athos
      hasn't got a chance.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (a choke of emotion)
                   I'll never forget you.

                                  ATHOS
                   Go!
      Athos turns away, SHOOTS at another horseman.       D'Artagnan
      runs to his MOUNT, GALLOPS away.

                                                               98.

      He rides, straining to hear the sounds of GUNFIRE. As
      long as the SHOTS continue, he knows Athos is alive.
      Abruptly... the SHOTS CEASE.
      D'Artagnan swallows his heart, and rides.

105   EXT. ROAD TO CALAIS - NIGHT                                    105

      A lonely stretch of road, illuminated by moonlight. A
      signpost announces: CALAI 15 LEAGUES. An exhausted
      HORSE CLOPS INTO VIEW, its rider half-conscious in the
      saddle. It is d'Artagnan. He can barely keep his eyes
      open. Suddenly, d'Artagnan passes out, tumbles from
      his saddle, and lands in the middle of the road. He
      opens his eyes once -- a sky filled with stars -- then
      closes them.
      We hear HORSES, and the CREAK of a CARRIAGE APPROACHING.
      The DRIVER brakes, and the horses are brought to a halt
      just short of trampling d'Artagnan. In the darkness, we
      can make out other shapes, rugged men on horseback,
      bodyguards to the carriage's passenger. Milady de
      Winter.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   What is it, Henri?
                                 HENRI (DRIVER)
                   There's a body in the road, Milady.
                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   Be careful.
      Pistols are cocked.    Henri's shadow falls across
      d'Artagnan's body.
                                 HENRI
                   It's a young man. He appears to
                   be injured.
      We hear the CARRIAGE DOOR OPEN.     FOOTSTEPS to d'Artagnan's
      side.

                                 MILADY (O.S.)
                   My, what a handsome boy. Put him
                   inside with me.

      Strong hands grasp d'Artagnan and lift him from the cold
      ground.
                                                     CUT TO:

106   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV - BLACK SCREEN                             106
      Out of the darkness, a face appears,   BLURRY and OBSCURED.
      It FILLS the SCREEN, slowly swimming   INTO FOCUS. It is
      Milady de Winter, even more beautiful   in CLOSEUP.
      Familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory   combs gleam in her
      hair. She smiles warmly.

                                MILADY
                Welcome back.    Did you dream?

107   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               107

      reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn.
      D'Artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped
      up in a large bed. He blinks into the face of Milady
      who sits at the edge. His eyes widen with recognition,
      faint awe.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                You.
                                MILADY
                Have we met?

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I... saw you in Paris.
      D'Artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged.
      He looks around the large room. A FIRE ROARS in the
      grate. Food and drink have been set upon a table.
      D'Artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Where am I...?
                              MILADY
                This is Calais.

                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (with a jolt)
                Calais!
                       (muttered; to self)
                The ship... Tuesday at midnight...
      D'Artagnan leaps out of bed. Then realizes he is stark
      naked. Milady smiles. D'Artagnan gathers a bedsheet
      around him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                       (frantic)
                Where are my clothes?

                   Filthy. I'm having them cleaned.
                   Is something wrong?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What day is it? What time?!

      D'Artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters.
      Beyond: the harbor lights of the Port of Calais.
                                 MILADY
                   It's Tuesday, near nine.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Nine?   Are you sure?

      Somewhere in the night, a BELL TOLLS the HOUR.        Milady
      smiles.
                                 MILADY
                   Quite sure.
      D'Artagnan relaxes slightly.        Milady rises from the bed.
      She wears a sky blue dressing       gown, something soft and
      silken beneath it. D'Artagnan        reacts perceptibly. En-
      joying his discomfort, Milady       crosses the room, joins
      him at the window.
                                 MILADY
                   Are you in a hurry?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (after a beat)
                   How did I... get here?
                                 MILADY
                   I found you in the road.
                   Discarded. Like an unwanted
                   kitten. Do you have a name or
                   shall I make one up for you?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (nervous)
                   My name is d'Artagnan.

                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. I like that. I am
                   the Countess de Winter. Milady.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess?

                                 MILADY
                   My husband's dead.

                   I'm sorry.

                                 MILADY
                   I have learned to live with death.

      She manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a
      hint of danger. All in a single reply. D'Artagnan
      hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Countess, I'm very grateful for
                   what you've done, but I can't stay
                   here. I've got...

                                 MILADY
                   What...?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Important business.
                                 MILADY
                   How mysterious. A handsome young
                   man with 'important business' in
                   the still of night. Does it
                   involve a young lady?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   No.
                                 MILADY
                   Does it require clothes?
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.   I need my clothes.
                                 MILADY
                   They won't be ready for at least
                   an hour.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   An hour?
                                  MILADY
                   I told the  innkeeper to bring them
                   when they  are dry. Until then,
                   I'm afraid  you are my prisoner.
                   Would the  prisoner care for a
                   drink?

      Milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. As
      she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disap-
      pear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'Artagnan's
      heart stop.

      Milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him.      And
      offers a smile that dazzles and burns.

                                 MILADY
                   Good. Then we will sit by the
                   fire, and eat and drink, and you
                   may impress, perhaps even move me,
                   with the story of how you came to
                   lie unconscious, in the middle of
                   the night, on the road to Calais.
                          (soft seductively)

      D'Artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.

108   EXT. ROOF OF PALAIS CARDINAL (PARIS) - NIGHT                  108
      A CARRIER PIGEON FLUTTERS out of the dark sky, and enters
      its box. The little door on the other side opens. A
      hand reaches in and removes the bird. Richelieu unpeels
      the message on its leg.

109   INT. CARDINAL'S PRIVATE CHAMBER - NIGHT                       109
      A room as cold as the man who owns it. Behind
      Richelieu's desk, there is a life-sized portrait of the
      King. Rochefort occupies a window seat, cleaning
      d'Artagnan's sword. He lifts it to the light, and
      slashes the air. He stands, duels with an imaginary
      opponent. Richelieu enters with the message.

                                 RICHELIEU
                          (dry; re: Rochefort's

                   The wonderful thing about an
                   imaginary opponent is that he is
                   always greatly skilled, and always
                   easily defeated. The pride of
                   victory, without the risk of loss.
                   If only life were like that.

      Richelieu sits at his desk, peers at the message.      He
      looks up, pleased.

                   I told you not to worry about the
                   Musketeers. They are dead by now.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Buckingham's signature will be on
                   the treaty by morning.

                   to the kind intercession of Queen
                   Anne.
      Rochefort steps closer, speaks quietly.

      Richelieu pours two glasses of port, offers one to
      Rochefort. They turn, raise their glasses to the
      King's portrait. And drink.

      D'Artagnan and Milady face each other on a rug in front
      of the roaring fire. The plate of food between them is
      empty. They drink wine from goblets. D'Artagnan drains
      his cup, and stares into the burning embers. Milady
      speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:

                   You are sad.

                   I was thinking about my friends.
      Milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. She
      looks at d'Artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to
      continue. The warm room, the wine, her kindness. All
      conspire to loosen his tongue. D'Artagnan speaks
      quietly, from the heart:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   The three best friends a man could
                   have. We were separated on our
                   way to Calais. I'm afraid I'll
                   never see them again.

                                 MILADY
                   What brings you here?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'd like to tell you. But I can't.

                                 MILADY
                   'Important business.'

      D'Artagnan nods. He wants to impress her. He wants her
      to know how brave he is. And Milady is well aware of it.
      She looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.
                                 MILADY
                   I understand. Men make bold plans
                   in secret. And women wait... to
                   mourn, or to celebrate the outcome.
                   I know from experience, it's a
                   lonely vigil.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (after a beat)
                   All I can tell you is... I'm on a
                   mission for the King.
                                 MILADY
                          (looks up; laughs
                           lightly)
                   I've heard that one before.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm serious.
                                 MILADY
                   You are a young man. And young
                   men are given to exaggeration.
                   However, if you would like to
                   entertain me with a story, I'm
                   eager to hear it. And please,
                   make it very brave, filled with
                   handsome knights and beautiful
                   ladies. I know, a dragon --
      There is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than
      a woman who does not take him seriously. D'Artagnan acts
      accordingly, and reveals:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.
                                 MILADY
                          (alert; though
                           d'Artagnan doesn't
                           see it)
                   A spy...?
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.
                                 MILADY
                   I believe you...
                          (beat)
                   Aren't you afraid?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Musketeers are not afraid of
                   anything.
                                 MILADY
                   I knew it. I knew you were a
                   Musketeer the moment I saw you.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   You did?

                                 MILADY
                   Of course.
                          (with sudden concern)
                   But, d'Artagnan, if this spy was
                   to find out you are here, your
                   life could be in grave danger.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A Musketeer is not afriad of
                   danger.
                                 MILADY
                   I'm dangerous. You're not afraid
                   of me?
      Her tone heralds a sudden shift. D'Artagnan sees the
      look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him.
      But he resists. There is Constance's memory to consider.
      And midnight as it approaches.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You're not dangerous.

                                 MILADY
                   Then what am I?

                   You're... beautiful.

      Milady covers him with caresses. D'Artagnan resists
      slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied.

      Milady leans close, runs a fingertip along     the line of
      his jaw. Her dressing gown falls open at      the top, enough
      for d'Artagnan to see her breasts as they     press against
      the silk beneath it. Milady speaks as her      finger traces.

                                 MILADY
                   Beauty, danger. They are the same.
      And with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory
      comb...


111   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                  111
      He cannot continue.      Constance, the hour, a confusion he
      cannot deny.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   I'm sorry --
      D'Artagnan pulls back -- just as Milady's arm arcs down
      toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a
      dagger, attached to an ivory comb. D'Artagnan sees it in
      the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking
      the dagger to the rug. Milady leaps after it, hands out-
      stretched. D'Artagnan follows, battles for the dagger,
      stunned with fear and surprise:

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What're you doing?! Have you lost
                   your mind?!

                                 MILADY
                   You came to Calais to stop a spy
                   from sailing to England.

      D'Artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. Milady is the
      messenger he is seeking. He grabs the dagger, rolls to
      the side. Milady staggers after, the shoulder of her
      negligee rips open. D'Artagnan sees the soft white flesh,
      reacts with shock, recognition -- she bears the brand of
      the fleur de lis. The infamous mark of the murderess.
      Just as Athos told it to him.      Not so long ago.

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   My God...

                          (crying out)
                   Parker!!
      The chamber door flies open. Henri and Parker, the Indo-
      Chinese bodyguard, appear. Parker faces d'Artagnan with
      a half-smile. He holds out his hands, both empty. And
      steps toward him. D'Artagnan looks at the dagger in his
      right hand. Then, unwilling to fight the man with an un-
      fair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps
      forward to meet him.

      Parker disposes of d'Artagnan with lightning speed. A
      series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows.
      The young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the
      martial arts. Parker hoists d'Artagnan to his feet,
      dazed. Henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions.
      Milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair,
      and commands:
                                MILADY
                   Kill him.
      Parker holds him fast. Henri steps forward.        And
      d'Artagnan thinks fast.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   You can kill me. But a surprise
                   waits for you in England. That
                   even Buckingham can't prevent.
                                 MILADY
                          (stops Henri with
                           a gesture)
                   What... surprise?
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   That's one thing I'll never tell
                   you.
                                 MILADY
                   D'Artagnan. You are young, vain,
                   and foolish. But I do not know
                   if you are clever.

      D'Artagnan's expression reveals nothing. Except to
      suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping.
      Duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, Milady changes
      her mind.

                                 MILADY
                   We'll take him with us.

                   Parker will devise ways to
                   convince you to share your final
                   secret with me. It is a long
                   voyage.
      Milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty.

112   INT. INN - UPPER HALL AND LANDING - NEAR DAWN                112

      Milady emerges from her room, dressed for travel. She is
      followed by d'Artagnan, now clothed. He is flanked by
      Henri and Parker. Henri presses the blade of a knife
      against d'Artagnan's side.
                                 HENRI
                   The bodyguards are waiting outside.

      Milady leads them down the hall. But when she reaches
      the landing, and looks at the tavern below... she draws
      back with surprise.


113   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MILADY AND HER POV                          113
      The innkeeper, roused   from sleep, and wearing a night-
      shirt, is engaged in   urgent conversation with Armand de
      Winter -- the son of   the man Milady killed in Paris. The
      innkeeper shakes his   head. Armand grabs him by the
      collar.

      D'Artagnan sees Milady's reaction -- surprise, impatience,
      and just a hint of fear. Milady commands:
                                 MILADY
                   The back stairs. Hurry!
      They change directions. As he is pulled away, d'Artagnan
      catches a glimpse of Armand de Winter below.

      Milady's coach emerges from the carriage house, speeds
      away in the direction of the harbor. In the driver's
      seat, Henri whips the horses, driving them onward.
      Milady's seven bodyguards follow on horseback.

115   INT. CARRIAGE - NIGHT                                     115
      D'Artagnan and Parker  sit across from Milady. Her face
      betrays faint doubt,  apprehension. Emotions she is not
      used to feeling, let  alone displaying to the world around
      her. D'Artagnan sees   his opening... and speaks:
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                The man at the inn... what did
                he want?
                              MILADY
                       (hollow laugh)
                Justice. Honor. Revenge.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Why?

                              MILADY
                He is the brother of my late
                husband, Lord de Winter. He
                blames me for de Winter's death.
                He thinks I murdered him.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                Did you murder your husband,
                Milady?
                              MILADY
                What do you think?

      A beat. D'Artagnan studies her pale, beautiful face.
      Remembers Athos' tale of love and loss.
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                I think he's not the first husband
                you killed.
                       (off her look)
                I once knew a man, one of the
                Counts of Berry. He told me a
                story... of beauty and danger.
                He was the bravest man I've ever
                known. And the saddest.

                              MILADY
                I know...

      The truth strikes home. Milady cannot conceal it. But
      she does not react with anger or scorn. D'Artagnan has
      reminded her of the one thing in the world that still
      touches her heart. D'Artagnan looks at her with a steady
      gaze. Milady cannot hold it, she turns to the carriage
      window.

116   EXT. CALAIS - NIGHT                                        116
      Milady's carriage turns down a steep lane that leads to
      the harbor. The fog is so thick that only the masts of
      the schooners can be seen, poking out of the gloom.
      Their lanterns glow gloomily. The carriage comes to a

117   EXT. HARBOR OF CALAIS - NIGHT                              117

      The lights of the harbor are muted by low-hanging fog.
      We see the outline of a ship waiting at the pier. Henri
      helps Milady out of the carriage. D'Artagnan follows.
      Milady's bodyguards dismount, six of them. A motley
      bunch of sinister killers. They look around the pier,
      ready for any encounter.
      D'Artagnan takes in his surroundings.    There is a mel-
      ancholy air about him.
                              MILADY
                What's the matter, d'Artagnan?
                Still hoping for your friends to
                ride to the rescue?
                              D'ARTAGNAN
                My friends are dead.

                              MILADY
                Well. If it's any consolation,
                you'll soon be joining them.
      Milady's return to form does not surprise. Parker shoves
      d'Artagnan toward the fog-enshrouded ship. A name can be
      made out on her barnacled hull. Persephone.

                                                   CUT TO:

118   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                          118

      Henri calls out to the ship, which is little more than an
      outline in the fog, her boarding gangplank leading to
      the soupy darkness of her deck.

                              HENRI
                We are the Countess de Winter's
                party, arrived from Paris.
                Permission to come aboard.

      There is no reply.    Closely guarded by Parker, d'Artagnan
      strains to see.
                                                   (CONTINUED)

                                                                111.

118   CONTINUED:                                                       118
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                   Permission granted.

      Milady nods to Henri. He steps up the narrow gangplank,
      followed by Milady, d'Artagnan, Parker, and the six
      bodyguards.

                                                     CUT TO:

119   EXT. DECK OF THE PERSEPHONE - NIGHT                              119

      The deck is filled with swirling fog. Henri peers into
      the gloom as he climbs aboard, followed by the others.
      He addresses one of the crew, a tall figure standing
      nearby.

                                 HENRI
                   Take us to your captain.
      The tall figure does not reply, nor does he move.        Henri
      demands:
                                 HENRI
                   What are you, deaf?
      Henri goes to shake the man. He grabs his arm, and the
      man pitches forward, falling face first on the deck.
      Henri jumps back in alarm. Milady and the others react.
                                   BODYGUARD
                   What is this?
      Milady's Bodyguards rush around the deck, confront the
      other silent silhouettes. They, like the tall figure...
      are dead. The limp bodies topple at their touch. The
      Bodyguards shout alarm and panic:

                                  BODYGUARDS
                   Dead!   They're all dead!

                                 PORTHOS (O.S.)
                   Well I certainly hope so. After
                   all that hard work.

      That's when Porthos, and Aramis -- come swooping down
      from above like avenging angels. They swing on the ends
      of ropes, slicing through the air, then dropping feet
      first on top of Milady's Bodyguards. D'Artagnan stands
      open-mouthed, as his three friends draw their swords.

                                 ARAMIS
                          (calling to him)
                   You look like you've seen a ghost.

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Two of them.

                                 PORTHOS
                   Remind me to tell you the story
                   of horses that could fly above
                   raging waters. A heroic tale of
                   love, death, and Musketeers.
                   Suitable for the general public.
      Porthos wades into the Bodyguards, at play, shouting as
      he goes.
                                 PORTHOS
                   All right then. All those who
                   wish to die, raise your hands!
                   Don't by shy, there's plenty to
                   go around!
      D'Artagnan grabs a sword from the deck, turns to join
      the fray. And finds himself face to face with Parker, the
      Indo-Chinese bodyguard. Parker has two Oriental swords
      spinning in his hands. One knocks d'Artagnan's sword out
      of his hand. D'Artagnan does a back flip but falls on
      the slippery deck. As Parker is about to chop
      d'Artagnan's head off, his face grimaces as he is lifted
      on a sword OUT OF FRAME. In the mist Athos is revealed!
                                 ATHOS
                   Sorry I'm late. Did I miss
                   anything?
      D'Artagnan almost cries with happiness.       He leaps to his
      feet and embraces Athos.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I thought you were dead.

                                 ATHOS
                   Keep your mind on the mission,
                   d'Artagnan.

      He winks at d'Artagnan, returns to the fray. D'Artagnan
      follows. The Musketeers confront Milady's evil Bodyguards
      in the night and fog. Athos with brutal perfection.
      Porthos with strange weapons and a healthy sense of the
      absurd. And Aramis with familiar grace and artistry --
      and a marked determination to disable, not kill, his
      opponents.

      Milady views the latter with alarm. As the battle rages
      around her, she retreats into the shadows.

      Athos and d'Artagnan find themselves fighting side by
      side. Athos observes d'Artagnan's technique -- the usual
      frenetic windmill of feint and thrust -- with a frown.
                                 ATHOS
                   Boy, it's a miracle you're still
                   alive fighting like that.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   What do you mean?

                                 ATHOS
                   First, always find your enemy's
                   weakness. Second, take advantage
                   of it. Watch me.

      One of the Bodyguards, who wears a wooden leg, attacks
      Athos. Athos kicks the false leg out from under him,
      knocks him to the deck. D'Artagnan repeats, even as he
      disables his own foe.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Find the weakness. Take advantage.
                   Got it.
      Aramis kneels at a dying man, delivers muttered last
      rites. A Bodyguard races INTO VIEW, means to kill him
      where he kneels. Aramis doesn't miss a beat -- he shifts,
      rises, delivers a punch and kick, knocking the man off the
      ship to the water below. A SPLASH is heard. And Aramis
      resumes a priestly pose, continues the litany.
                                                      CUT TO:


120   EXT. PIER - NIGHT                                             120

      Two SAILORS, crew members of the Persephone, return to
      the ship after a night's drunk. They see and hear the
      mayhem ahead.

                                 SAILOR
                   That's our ship...
      The two Sailors pull out daggers, and bound up the
      gangplank.

      The two Sailors find themselves in the middle of a wild
      battle. They look around for someone to assault, see a
      large Musketeer with his back turned. They charge.

      Porthos hears them coming, spins. The two Sailors stop
      in their tracks, eyes popping with horrified recognition.

                                 BOTH SAILORS
                   Porthos the Pirate!!

      With a collective "yah!" the two Sailors drop their
      daggers, and flee into the foggy night. Porthos looks
      about to see if anyone noticed their exit. D'Artagnan
      grins nearby.

                                 PORTHOS
                   I told you I was famous.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN

                   Privateer.   There's a difference.
      Every Musketeer is running from something or someone.
      D'Artagnan deadpans:
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I love a good sea story.     Do tell
                   me sometime.
      Porthos reacts to d'Artagnan's jest. But before he can
      reply, the youth has bolted back to the fray.

      Athos drives several Bodyguards back with his sword,
      notices d'Artagnan working his way towards him.

                                 ATHOS
                   Did you find the Cardinal's spy?

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Yes.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill him?

                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                   Athos.   The spy... is a woman.

                   What?

      Athos turns to d'Artagnan, wonders. And at that moment,
      sees a figure at the gangplank, swathed in fog and diffuse
      light. Milady. Time stops as they regard each other
      across the deck, the battle between.

                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns and runs into the night.    Athos races after.

      With the speed and grace of a panther, Milady runs down
      the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her
      Bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. Athos appears
      moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse.
      And gives chase.

125   EXT. HARBOR ROAD - NIGHT                                      125

      Milady whips her horse, drives it onward. But Athos
      overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms.
      They fall to the ground with a crash. Milady grabs the
      deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle.
      Athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his
      side. Milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the half-
      light. And lowers the dagger. She will not kill him.

      Milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest.
      But Athos stands and shouts:
                                ATHOS
                   Stop!!
      Milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him.
      Athos holds his musket in a steady hand. A very long
      beat. Milady takes a step closer. Finally, she whispers,
      with love, with hate:
                                MILADY
                   Athos.

                                 ATHOS
                   How did you do it, Sabine? How
                   did you come back from the dead?

                   A kind gentleman took pity on me.

                                 ATHOS
                   I did not.

                                 MILADY
                   No, Count. You were too proud to
                   listen to the truth. I learned
                   the value of lies soon after.

      Athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the
      past and what it brings.
                                 ATHOS
                   Give me the Cardinal's treaty.

                                 MILADY
                   No.
                                 ATHOS
                   Then I will shoot.
      Athos cocks the trigger.     Milady whispers:
                                  MILADY
                   Be kind.   And aim for my heart.
      Athos' face is a mask of contradiction. He tries to pull
      the trigger, but it is not in him. Milady recognizes
      his pain with a nod. She feels it, too. Then, briefly,
      before she leaves him, Milady speaks softly. The past,
      their love, and where it led them.

                                 MILADY
                   I remember... everything.

      She turns and runs away... directly into the arms of
      Armand de Winter. He has ridden, and he has followed,
      and he has finally found her here.

                                 ARMAND
                   Countess de Winter...

      The public room is empty, save for d'Artagnan and the
      three Musketeers. They gather around a table. Aramis
      holds the treaty in his gloved hand. The mood is somber
      and tense.

                   The treaty outlines Richelieu's
                   plan to forge an alliance with
                   Buckingham.
                                 PORTHOS
                   What about the King?

                                 ARAMIS
                   He is not mentioned directly. But
                   the agreement is contingent on a
                   'demonstration' of the Cardinal's
                   power.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   A demonstration? What does that
                   mean?
                                   ARAMIS
                   I don't know.
      Athos' face grows dark. He has been silent throughout.
      Now he rises to his feet.

                                 ATHOS
                   I know someone who does.
      D'Artagnan, Aramis, and Porthos watch in grim silence as
      Athos crosses the room to an imposing door.

127   INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT                                    127
      A fire burns in the grate. Milady sits beside it in a
      chair, staring into the glowing embers. Their hot re-
      flection dances in her pale blue eyes. There is a KNOCK
      at the door. Armand de Winter emerges from a dark corner
      of the room where he has been standing guard with an
      impassive executioner. He crosses to the door, opens it.
      And Athos steps inside.
                                 ATHOS
                   I'd like a word with your
                   prisoner.

                   She dies at dawn.

      Athos nods, and steps to Milady, stands before her.
      Milady stares at the fire, speaks softly, her eyes on the
      flames.

                          (quietly sardonic)
                   Did you come to offer me
                   consolation?
                                ATHOS
                   No.

      Milady turns, looks up to face him.
                                 MILADY
                   There was a time when I would've
                   given my life for a kind word.
                                 ATHOS
                   I could not give it, Sabine.
                   I was... a fool.
      Milady hears the regret in his voice, holds his gaze.
      Athos indicates Armand in the corner.
                                 ATHOS
                   Did you kill his brother and his
                   father as he says?
                                 MILADY

                           honest at the
                           last)
                   I have become... the nightmare
                   you once thought me to be.
                                 ATHOS
                   But not before. Not us.
                                MILADY
                   No. The memory will keep me
                   company.
      Athos kneels at her side, near to pleading:

                                 ATHOS
                   Do you know the Cardinal's plans?
                                MILADY
                   Yes.

                                ATHOS
                   Tell me.

                                 MILADY
                   Will you spare my life?
                                ATHOS
                   I can't.

                   Society demands swift justice.
                          (off his look)
                   I'll take the secret to my grave.

                                 ATHOS
                   Sabine. You'll die for your
                   crimes. Nothing can stop that.
                   But how you leave this world is
                   up to you.
      Milady offers a half-smile, takes his hand in hers.

                                 MILADY
                   What did the world ever do for me?
      HOLD ON Athos.       Milady's hand in his.   All that he is
      feeling.

128   EXT. SEASIDE CLIFFS - NIGHT                                   128
      A hundred feet below, waves crash on a rocky shore. On
      the jagged cliff above, a black mass of trees is outlined
      against a stormy sky filled with copper-colored clouds,
      surreal in effect. A sinister procession approaches the
      cliff.
      Porthos leads Milady. She wears a simple white shift,
      her hair pulled back into a long braid. She looks years
      younger, the girl she used to be. The Executioner walks
      behind them. Followed by Armand de Winter, Aramis,
      d'Artagnan. And Athos. He watches every step.

      The procession stops at the cliff's edge.
      THUNDER RUMBLES. Lightning slashes the sky. The
      Executioner ties Milady's hands behind her. The
      Executioner removes a bright scimitar from beneath his
      cloak. Milady catches Athos' eye. He holds her gaze.

      He stares at Milady unflinchingly, as if to burn her
      image into his eyes, so that he might keep it there until
      the day he dies.
      Aramis reaches inside his cloak, removes the sacred
      priestly cloth he carries.

      The Executioner delivers the formal litany:

                                 EXECUTIONER
                   I forgive you for your crimes.
                   Die in peace.

      Athos repeats, whispers:

                                   ATHOS
                   Die in peace.

      Aramis comes forward, intones:
                                 ARAMIS
                   I am the resurrection and the
                   life, sayeth the Lord. He that
                   believeth in me, though he were
                   dead, yet shall he live; and
                   whosoever liveth and believeth
                   in me shall never die...
      The Executioner's sharp blade shines in the light of
      dawn.

                                 EXECUTIONER
                   On your knees.
      Milady kneels, the Executioner steps closer. The tableau
      silhouetted against a reddish glow on the horizon. The
      Executioner brushes Milady's braid from her neck,
      exposing the soft white skin beneath. He raises the
      scimitar overhead, and just as he is about to bring it
      down... a cry is heard, torn from the heart:

                                   ATHOS
                   No.

      Athos grabs the Executioner's wrist, and twists the
      scimitar loose. It falls to the ground.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   What's this...?
      Porthos leaps forward, locks his great arms around Athos.

                                   PORTHOS
                   Athos --
      But Athos breaks free.       Milady rises to her feet.   Athos
      rushes to her.

                                 ATHOS
                   Forgive me, Sabine.       Please
                   forgive.

                   I do.

      The words he could never say, finally spoken. Milady
      locks eyes with him. Athos' desperate act, the pure
      feeling it signifies, has given her a kind of release.
      And the strength to face her fate.

                                 MILADY
                   The Cardinal intends to assassinate
                   the King at his birthday celebration
                   on Friday.
      And with that, Milady reaches forward, offers a gentle
      kiss. Then, as Athos and the others look on, stunned,
      uncertain... she takes a backward step, finds the
      cliff's edge... and steps over it. The Executioner
      rushes to look after. The others follow. Except for
      Athos, who remains rooted in place, eyes on the
      distant horizon. A long silence. THUNDER RUMBLES.
                                 EXECUTIONER
                   God's justice be done.

      D'Artagnan sadly lowers his head. Porthos puts a
      consoling hand on his shoulder. Aramis stands to the
      other side, mutters:
                                 ARAMIS
                   Amen.
                                 ATHOS
                   Musketeers.

      D'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis turn. Athos has regained
      his former self. Stoic, in command. And hiding a broken
      heart.

                                 ATHOS
                   The King's life in danger.   We
                   have work to do.

      Louis XIII, usually found hanging behind Richelieu's

      heart should be.

                 He can do it every time.
      Rochefort signals approval to a solitary marksman
      positioned far away on one of the roof parapets. The
      marksman rises from a shooter's crouch, bows curtly,
      and begins to reload his musket.

                               RICHELIEU
                 And he has no qualms about...
                               ROCHEFORT
                 None. He believes that man should

                 Whatever you're paying him, double

      hum and imbeds itself on the public wall. Attached to

      HOOFBEATS interrupt. The Captain turns in irritation.
      And Porthos and Aramis ride to either side, snatch the
      man up by the arms, drag him briefly through the air,
      and deposit him with a thud against a hitching post.
      The Captain, stunned, looks down at the piece of

137   INT. LOUVRE - GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY             137
      A gathering of nobles and ladies, all in full ceremonial
      dress. Rochefort is there as well, the familiar eye
      patch, in command of the Cardinal's Guards. A Seneschal
      waits at the door with two flanking lines of trumpeteers.
      The trumpeteers raise their instruments and blow a royal
      blast.

                                                          124.

138   ENTRANCE DOORS                                             138
      Louis, Queen Anne, and their retinue enter from a
      corridor, proceed slowly across the room toward the
      balcony that overlooks the waiting crowd outside.
      Noblemen bow, and their ladies curtsy as the King and
      Queen pass. Constance, dressed for the occasion, looks
      on from the sidelines, smiles. The King and Queen
      proceed, two teenagers with the world at the feet.

                              LOUIS
                They look... happy.

                              ANNE
                Hungry, more likely.
                              LOUIS
                Still, you were right about the
                celebration. And when the Cardinal
                told me how much it meant to you...
                              ANNE
                I said nothing.
                             LOUIS
                But... ?
                              ANNE
                The Cardinal expressed in
                confidence how much the celebration
                would mean to you...
      Both pause to consider the manipulation.


139   INT. ANTEROOM - DAY                                        139
      Richelieu stands in an anteroom just off the procession,
      he watches the King and Queen as they walk, speaks
      quietly, to himself:
                              RICHELIEU
                I'm not sure which is sadder... to
                die so young. Or to die a King.
      Richelieu turns from the procession. Speaks to Rochefort
      who pauses in the shadowy alcove behind him.

                              RICHELIEU
                France will not go wanting. A new
                King will sit on the throne. The
                true King after all...

      He says it quiet fervor, the dream at long last within
      reach. Then, as if to reassure:
                                                 (CONTINUED)

                   Is everything ready?

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   Yes, Your Eminence.

                                   RICHELIEU
                   Are you sure?
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I'd stake my life on it, Your
                   Eminence.
                                 RICHELIEU
                          (a dark beat)
                   Rest assured, Captain. You have.

140   EXT. GROUNDS OUTSIDE LOUVRE - DAY                          140
      The balcony has been colorfully decorated. The crowd
      focuses its attention on the empty space where the King
      will soon appear. Below, the entrance to the Palace is
      protected by a double line of the Cardinal's Guards,
      resplendent in their crimson tunics. It would take an
      army to get past them.

      The streets leading to the Palace are clogged with
      people, all pushing and straining to get closer.
      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers arrive on horseback,
      are forced to dismount. They push through the crowd,
      trying to reach the Palace, afraid that they will be too
      late. Athos barks orders as they struggle forward:

                                 ATHOS
                          (to d'Artagnan)
                   Look through the surrounding area.
                   We'll try to reach the King...

                                   D'ARTAGNAN
                   But...?
                                   ATHOS
                   Go!

      Athos and the others press on. D'Artagnan, a little
      disappointed to be left behind, pauses, checks the
      buildings that loom overhead. Then he starts, reacts
      with shock and surprise.

                                                               126.

142   D'ARTAGNAN'S POV                                            142
      The bell tower of the Carmes-Deschaux monastery. A
      figure moving about, dimly-viewed, but this much is
      clear. The man is not a monk. And he is carrying a
      musket in his hands.

143   BACK TO SCENE                                               143

      D'Artagnan turns to alert the Musketeers. Too late, they
      have already vanished into the throng. D'Artagnan takes
      off running for the monastery.

144   BELL TOWER                                                      144

      HIGH ABOVE the swelling scene. The marksman assumes a
      crouching position, raises his musket, and trains it on
      the empty balcony where the King is soon to appear.

      Louis and Anne continue toward the balcony. Richelieu
      trails the royal couple. He nods to Rochefort in
      passing. They exchange significant smiles. Anne spots
      the smirk on Rochefort's face. He resumes a supplicant
      pose. Anne glances back, Richelieu behind them.
                                 ANNE
                   I do not trust him.
                                 LOUIS
                   I'm not sure who to trust.
                                 ANNE
                   Then we will discover the truth
                   together.
      Louis likes the sound of that.     They step side by side
      toward the balcony.

      Bell ropes, hundreds of feet long, dangle down the
      vertiginous shaft. D'Artagnan races up the narrow,
      circular stairs. Above him is the open trap to the bell
      tower. He catches a glimpse of the marksman, back
      turned, taking aim.

      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis push their way through the
      crowd, trying desperately to reach the Palace entrance.
      But the throng is impenetrable. Athos turns, wonders.
      And shoots a worried look at the bell tower of the
      Carmes-Deschaux, looming against the sky, as if to intuit
      the danger lurking there.

      Louis and Anne lead the procession to the doors of the
      balcony. The crowd roars and the TRUMPETS BLARE. The
      King steps into the sunlight. The Queen follows, then
      Richelieu. The three most important people in France
      stand together, acknowledging the clamoring multitudes.

      The marksman takes careful aim. The cheering down below
      is like a faint whisper at this altitude. The marksman
      cocks the hammer of his flinklock.

      handful of rope, using his weight to RING the BELL

      Pandemonium, inside and outside the Palace. Athos,
      Porthos, and Aramis emerge from the crowd at the entrance,
      draw their swords, and prepare to rush the long line of
      Guards protecting the doors. The Guards cannot believe
      what they are seeing. Three men against a hundred. It's
      ridiculous. But then... the looks on Guards' faces begin
      to change, subtly at first, from amusement to horror.

154   THEIR POV                                                   154

      Behind Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, something incredible
      happens. Musketeers appear from every direction. Some
      from the surrounding crowd. Some from buildings, roof-
      tops. Others appear on horseback, a few disguised as
      monks. And all defiantly wearing their blue and gold
      tunics.
      The murmur of the crowd becomes an excited roar. The
      corps of Musketeers line up behind Athos, Porthos, and
      Aramis. Porthos and Aramis exchange a smile. Athos
      keeps his usually dour expression. But his eyes are
      charged with excitement. They raise their arms, and
      face the long line of Guards. A hundred sabers flash in
      the sunlight.
                                ATHOS
                  Save the King!!

      The Musketeers charge.   It is a glorious sight.

      D'Artagnan scrambles up through the trapdoor, and tackles
      the marksman. As the BELL CONTINUES TO CLANG, they fight
      hand-to-hand. The marksman forces d'Artagnan toward the
      edge of the tower. Two hundred feet to the ground below.
      They remain deadlocked for a beat, the marksman inching
      d'Artagnan backward, certain death behind him. And at
      the last moment, d'Artagnan summons up the strength of
      three -- and shoves the marksman backward with a resound-
      ing kick.

      The marksman stumbles, falls through the open trapdoor,
      and plunges to his death.
      D'Artagnan peers down the shaft. There's a faint CRASH
      as the marksman hits bottom. Utilizing the bell ropes
      like a fireman's pole, d'Artagnan grabs hold and slides
      down into the abyss.

156   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                     156
      Pandemonium reigns. Rochefort instructs his Guards to
      close the huge door to the great hall. The members of
      the King's royal court run in panicked circles, convinced
      the palace is under seige. Constance pauses amid the
      riot, seeks the Queen.

      But Richelieu has found her first. He steps to Anne,
      assumes an air of priestly innocence.
                              RICHELIEU
                Your Majesty...

      But Louis steps INTO VIEW, puts a protecting arm around
      his wife, speaks stern command:

                              LOUIS
                Leave us... alone.
      That's when a loud BOOM rocks the room.


157   ANOTHER ANGLE                                             157
      The great door shudders under the impact of a terrific
      blow. Another BOOM and the great hall is plunged into
      further chaos. The regiment of Guards rush forward,
      press their bodies against the door to secure it.
      BOOM -- the great door threatens to split in half.
      Richelieu huddles with Rochefort amid the rising panic.
      His eyes narrow to mean slits, he gestures toward Louis
      and Anne across the room.

                              RICHELIEU
                       (a cold whisper)
                Kill him. Kill her, too.

      Rochefort draws d'Artagnan's sword from its sheath. He
      advances on Louis and Anne. Louis has witnessed the
      latter, treason confirmed. He raises his own sword,
      prepared to protect his Queen. To die for her if
      necessary.
                              LOUIS
                       (to Anne)
                Get behind me.
      Rochefort takes confident steps toward the King. But
      one last BOOM and the great DOOR comes CRASHING down on
      the Guards, revealing a tide of Musketeers on the other
      side. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis at the lead.

      Louis breaks into a wide grin. The Musketeers wade into
      the Guards, and the great hall is transformed into a bat-
      tlefield. Rochefort turns, sees Athos charging at him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Greetings, Monsieur Cyclops.   Are

                                   ROCHEFORT
                   Not for long.

      Athos and Rochefort lock swords and duel.

158   BATTLE                                                     158

      Musketeers surround Louis and Anne to ward off attack.
      But the young King has no intention of being protected.
      He wades to the fore, fights side by side with his
      Musketeers. Anne watches him with a host of emotions.
      Respect, admiration... love. Louis pauses to return her
      gaze, then returns to battle.
      Constance dashes through the fray. She sees a Guard
      slip behind a curtain, approach the Queen. She grabs a
      heavy goblet, shouts:
                                   CONSTANCE
                   Look out!
      Anne looks up. Constance tosses the goblet to her. Anne
      catches it neatly, brings it down on the head of the
      hapless Guard. Constance smiles, leaps forward.

      Aramis cuts down a Guard. As another man comes at him
      from behind, Porthos intervenes, runs the man through.
      The two Musketeers pause to exchange deadpan thanks,
      and continue.
      Athos and Rochefort slash at each other. It is a mighty
      confrontation. But Athos soon gains the upper hand.
      Rochefort shouts to a nearby Guard for help. Now it's
      two on one. Athos receives a wound in the shoulder, he
      staggers... and the treaty falls from his tunic to the
      floor. Rochefort reacts with a start, he grabs the
      treaty, stuffs it into his doublet. Athos shakes off
      the sudden pain, disposes of the Guard. Rochefort and
      Athos face each other a second time. Athos wounded,
      Rochefort confident he can finish the injured Musketeer.

      But Athos merely changes sword hands. Rochefort reacts.
      Their SABERS CLASH as they draw together. Rochefort
      grabs a dagger from his belt with his free hand. But
      Athos sees it coming, and smashes Rochefort across the
      face with his fist.

      Rochefort goes sprawling. He loses his sword, it slides
      across the floor until someone's foot stops it.
      Rochefort looks up... and sees d'Artagnan standing on
      the blade.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This sword belongs to me.

      D'Artagnan stoops to pick up his long-lost sword. He
      tosses his other saber to Rochefort, who catches it
      neatly. Athos watches from a short distance, knows
      this moment belongs to d'Artagnan. He will not intervene.
      But he shouts:
                                  ARAMIS
                   D'Artagnan.   Kill him where he
                   stands.
      These are d'Artagnan's words. A son vowing to avenge the
      death of his father. D'Artagnan wonders. Rochefort
      confirms.
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   By all means. Let's discover if
                   you are as brave a man as your
                   father was. And as foolish.
                                  D'ARTAGNAN
                          (stunned by the
                            revelation as it
                            unfolds)
                   What...?
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   He died for his King and for
                   France. But most of all... he
                   died on the end of my sword.
                          (the final curse)
                   As will you.
      Rochefort smiles a taunt.     D'Artagnan raises his sword,
      whispers to heaven.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   This is for you, Father.

      Then, eyes blazing, d'Artagnan attacks Rochefort with
      everything he's got, driving him into an adjoining
      chamber.


159   ANGLE TO INCLUDE CHAMBER                                     159
      A FIRE ROARS in a great stone hearth. Its light pro-
      jects giant shadows on the wall as d'Artagnan and
      Rochefort duel, slashing at each other.

                                                             132.

160   GREAT HALL                                                    160
      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis take the fight to the
      Cardinal's Guards. Each with his by-now familiar
      tradmarks. King Louis fighting beside them.

161   D'ARTAGNAN AND ROCHEFORT                                     161

      They battle before the blazing fire, sweat covers their
      faces. Rochefort wears a wolfish grin. But d'Artagnan
      has learned his lessons well. He attacks with gusto.
      Rochefort's grin soon turns toward desperation. He
      cannot match the boy's vengeful steel. So he drives a
      knee into d'Artagnan's groin. D'Artagnan falls to the
      floor. Rochefort means to finish him there. But
      d'Artagnan rolls away from the blade, leaps back to his
      feet. Undaunted, he hurls himself at his hated opponent.

      Rochefort sidesteps, throws d'Artagnan against a wall.
      He pins him there, stunning the youth. And hisses with
      superior disdain:
                                 ROCHEFORT
                   One thing's certain. You're no
                   Musketeer.
      But d'Artagnan remembers Athos' advice. "Always find
      your enemy's weakness." He shoves a thumb into
      Rochefort's good eye. Rochefort stumbles backward.
      D'Artagnan plunges his sword into Monsieur Cyclops's
      heart.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   Take it back...?

                                 ROCHEFORT
                   I might... have been... mistaken.

      Rochefort crumples to the floor, dead. D'Artagnan looks
      at Rochefort's blood on his sword. His father's death
      finally avenged. That's when he hears the RUSTLE of a
      SILKEN ROBE. D'Artagnan pivots, sees Richelieu kneeling
      at Rochefort's body... extracting the treaty from his
      doublet.
                                D'ARTAGNAN
                   No!!

      Richelieu smiles,   hurls the treaty into the blazing
      fireplace. As the    flames begin to lick at the parchment
      paper, d'Artagnan   flies past the Cardinal, and dives
      after to retrieve   it.

                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                               133.

161   CONTINUED:                                                      161
      Athos, Porthos, and Aramis enter the room. D'Artagnan
      stumbles out of the fireplace, covered with soot,
      clutching the treaty. He grins. ON d'Artagnan's look
      of triumph...
                                                    CUT TO:


162   INT. GREAT HALL AND THRONE ROOM - DAY                       162
      A short time later. The battle is over. The Musketeers
      have won. On the dais, Louis and Anne confront Richelieu
      who is a prisoner now, guarded by several Musketeers.
      Louis holds the recovered treaty in his hands.

      D'Artagnan and the three Musketeers stand nearby.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   Your Majesty, that document is an
                   obvious forgery. I am clearly the
                   victim of a conspiracy designed
                   and perpetuated by these three
                   Musketeers.

      Richelieu assumes a trustworthy pose, one familiar to
      both King and Queen.
                                 LOUIS
                   This is a complicated matter,
                   Your Eminence, affecting both
                   France and the crown...
      A beat. As all wonder if Richelieu will manage to elude
      blame after all. But Louis continues with quiet author-
      ity, just a trace of humor. As King, and as a man.
                                 LOUIS
                   And so, until such time as I and
                   my advisors --
                          (gestures toward
                           Anne; the
                           Musketeers)
                   -- can determine the whole truth
                   of the matter. I invite you to
                   await our decision in the comfort
                   of... the Bastille.

      Musketeers close in around the Cardinal.     He fumes,
      protests.

                                 RICHELIEU
                   You can't do this to me.   I'm the
                   Cardinal of France.
                                                    (CONTINUED)

                                                                  134.

162   CONTINUED:                                                         162
                                 LOUIS
                          (never more certain)
                   And I am its King.
      Shouts of "Long live the King!       Long live the King!"

                                 LOUIS
                   And as King... I hereby reinstate
                   the Musketeers.
      A tremendous cheer is heard from all. Richelieu is led
      from the room. He pauses in front of d'Artagnan.
                                 RICHELIEU
                   Congratulations, Monsieur
                   d'Artagnan. I'll be keeping an
                   eye on you.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                          (unphased)
                   Thank you, Your Eminence.    I'll
                   be watching you, too.
      Richelieu smiles his crocodile smile. Followed by
      guards, he turns and strides away, hands clasped behind
      his back, scarlet robes billowing behind him.
      Louis turns to the Musketeers.       He indicates d'Artagnan.

                                 LOUIS
                   Is this the young man who saved
                   my life?
      Porthos puts a hand on d'Artagnan's shoulder.
                                 PORTHOS
                   His name's d'Artagnan, Sire.

                                 LOUIS
                   Approach, d'Artagnan.

      D'Artagnan's heart pounds as he draws closer to King and
      Queen. Then he remembers, reaches into his doublet. And
      turns to the Queen.

                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I have something that belongs to
                   ... Your Majesty...
      D'Artagnan produces the bracelet he found on the country
      road. He holds it out to her. The King wonders, the
      Queen smiles.
                                                       (CONTINUED)

162   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            162
                                 ANNE
                   Thank you, d'Artagnan. But the
                   bracelet does not belong to me.
                          (off his look)
                   It belongs to her.

      Anne indicates Constance, who steps forward, INTO VIEW.
      D'Artagnan and Constance lock eyes for the third time.
      The thrill of recognition, the promise of romance,
      charges between. D'Artagnan slips the bracelet around
      her wrist. Constance kisses him on the cheek. Louis
      continues:
                                 LOUIS
                   D'Artagnan, I am in your debt.
                   What can I do to repay the courage
                   you've shown me? Anything,
                   D'Artagnan.  Whatever your heart
                   desires...
      D'Artagnan knows what he wants. But he is tongue-tied,
      unable to ask for it. Athos asks for him.
                                 ATHOS
                   Majesty, his heart has only one
                   desire. To become a Musketeer.
      D'Artagnan looks at Athos, thankful for the intercession.
      Louis answers with pleasure.
                                 LOUIS
                   Then kneel, d'Artagnan.
      D'Artagnan drops to his knees. Louis lays the blade of
      his sword on each of his shoulders.
                                 LOUIS
                   The world is an uncertain realm,
                   filled with danger. Truth
                   despoiled by broken promises.
                   Honor undermined by the pursuit
                   of gold. Freedom sacrificed when
                   the weak are oppressed by the
                   strong. But there are those who
                   oppose these powerful forces.
                   Those who dedicate their lives to
                   truth, honor, and freedom. They
                   are a constant reminder to all of
                   us. That such a life is not just
                   possible, but necessary to our
                   continued survival. As a country,
                   as a King. These men are known as
                   the Musketeers...

      As Louis speaks, D'Artagnan closes his eyes; countless
      images rush through his mind. His home in Gascony,
      Constance and Queen Anne on the country road, his first
      encounters with Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, their
      adventures together, the face of Milady. It's been a
      busy week.

                                 LOUIS
                   Rise, d'Artagnan. And join them.
                   Musketeer.

      D'Artagnan stands, transformed from boy to man. BELLS
      RING in the distance. Constance smiles brightly, tears
      gleam in her eyes. Athos, Porthos, and Aramis surround
      their young friend, and happily present him with the
      bright blue tunic of the Musketeers. They slip the tunic
      over d'Artagnan's head, react with a cheer. D'Artagnan
      hugs each of the three. For each has given him gifts
      more valuable than gold.
      Porthos, Aramis, and last... Athos.       Who, to the surprise
      of all who know him... smiles.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Do my eyes deceive me?
                                 ARAMIS
                   I find it hard to believe myself.

                                 PORTHOS
                   His lips, unused as they are to
                   such a contortion, twisted and
                   stretched... into a smile.

                                 ARAMIS
                   It was spectacular. And what
                   teeth.

      D'Artagnan basks in their company, wonders aloud.
                                 D'ARTAGNAN
                   I know this is a stupid question.
                   But what exactly does a Musketeer
                   do?

      Porthos and Aramis exchange a glance.       They're not so
      sure themselves.
                                 PORTHOS
                   Truth... honor...

                                 ARAMIS

                           a third)
                   And freedom.

               called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere 
               in the world, they are always first on the
               scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, 
               the Thunderbirds.

               (Counts down numbers and shows corresponding
               Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go!
 
               
               Cuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window.
 
               
               
               But in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind.
 
               
               
               
                             TEACHER
               So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus 
               B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what 
               happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E,
               F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window
               and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy!

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan. Alan!

               
               Alan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who 
               is now standing in front of him.
 
               
                             TEACHER
               How kind of you to come back from outer 
               space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't 
               too rough?
 
               (Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) 
               Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean
               theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in?
 
               
                             ALAN TRACY
               I was just...

               
                             TEACHER
               Apparently not (she picks up his notebook 
               which he has been doodling in) "Thunderbirds 
               are go."

               Well, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring 
               break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk
               the day you get back. That should keep you busy.
 
               
               Bells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk 
               out to their lockers.
 
               
                             ALAN
               (mocking the teacher) "That should keep 
               you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 
               10,000 words 
               and stick them right up your..."

               
                             FERMAT
               Alan!

               
               Both boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them 
               while walking by with the teacher from before

               
                             ALAN
               Headmaster.

               
                             HEADMASTER
               Mr. Tracy!

               
                             ALAN
               Miss Garrett.

                             FERMAT
               You gotta be more careful Alan.

                             ALAN
               Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird 
               Fermat?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds 
               yet. And if your identity was discovered, 
               it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad.

               
                             ALAN
               I know, I know.

               
                             EXCITED KID
               It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna 
               be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be 
               on TV.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they?

               
                             EXCITED KID
               In Russia, at an oil rig fire.

               
                             ALAN
               Great! I'm stuck at school and my brothers 
               are on another cool mission.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Wanna watch?

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah!

               
               Boys go into a crowded room with a TV on the news channel

               
                             LISA LOWE
               We are told this super-rig is now in 
               danger of total collapse.

               And there is real concern for the lives of six 
               men who remain trapped on board.

               An emergency call went out to the Thunderbirds just a few minutes 
               ago. They should be here any moment now.

               (pauses and points at the sky while exclaiming excitedly) 
               And here they are!
 
               
               The boys watching the TV begin to cheer

                             SCOTT TRACY
               Thunderbird 2 this is Thunderbird 1. 
               I have visual, south
 
               column, they're trapped on an inspection platform.

               
                             JEFF TRACY
               FAB. We'll take it from here.

                             JEFF
               Scott, get out. That tower's coming 
               down.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               Got it.

               
               A blast of fire hits Thunderbird 1 and sends it a little farther 
               away from the accident zone.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Thunderbird 1 any damage?

               
                             SCOTT
               Negative, Dad.

                             ALAN
               Come on, come on! Swing around. You 
               can't get close enough, taking that 
               approach angle.
 
               
                             JEFF
               This approach angle's no good. Gonna 
               have to swing her around.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               Watch the wind shear Thunderbird 2.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Scotty, I was watching for wind shear 
               when you were still wearing diapers.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, Dad.

               
               A blast of fire comes toward Thunderbird 2

               
                             JEFF
               Whoa! Hold on!

               
                             SCOTT
               Who needs the diapers now, Dad?

               
                             FERMAT
               What do they do now?

               
                             ALAN
               Probably drop the rescue platform from 
               Thunderbird 2.
 
               
                             VIRGIL TRACY
               Open 'em up. Here we go. Rescue platform's 
               on its way.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Virgil, how's it going?

               
                             VIRGIL
               It's looking good, Dad.

               
                             CREW MEMBER
               Come on! Jump!

               
                             VIRGIL
               Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. 
               Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. 
               (Directed toward the
 
               crew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come 
               on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get
 
               you out of here.

               
                             CREW MEMBER
               READY

               
                             ANOTHER CREW MEMBER

               Okay, let's bring 'em home.

               
                             CREW MEMBER
               Look out! (a couple of crew members 
               bump into each other as they are hoisted 
               up)
 
               
                             ALAN
               Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That 
               rig's gonna blow.
 
               
                             CREW MEMBER
               Hang on!

               Boys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the 
               water a little bit
 
                             JEFF
               Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here 
               we go.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, Virgil.

               has
 
               robbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds 
               have done it again, Chuck! '
 
               
               The boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering.

               here for you.
 
               
               Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, at your service. Alan darling, 
               your father's been unexpectedly detained.
 
               And he's asked me to pick you up. Is that all right?

               
                             FERMAT
               Sure beats the bus!

               Fantastic. Now, will any of these gorgeous

               All of the boys raise their hands and shout for Alan to choose 
               them.
 
                             ALAN
               Just Fermat.

                             LADY PENELOPE
               Quite right.

               
                             ALAN
               Lady Penelope, why are you in America? 
               Are you on a mission for my father?

               obliged to deliver the Parker Haymaker.

               Okay, bring it on, big guy.

               
               They are all in the car and Parker is driving away

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Try not to run over any children, Parker.
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               Very good, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Come on, Parker, chop chop!

               
               Lady Penelope's begins to fly

               YES!

               Yeah! the boys high five

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               (reading a newspaper) Oh, look, Parker. 
               Pink is the new black this season.
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               I'm very glad to hear it, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               And hemlines are going up.

               
                             PARKER
               That is good news, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Oh and apparently England won the football

               Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off 
               the steering wheel and the car begins 
               to move to one side)
 
                             FERMAT AND ALAN
               Whoa!

                             LADY PENELOPE
               Calm down, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Yes, milady. Sorry, milady.

               Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll

               Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration 
               on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination

               Have a safe flight home, Penny.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Thanks, Jeff.

               
               Scene switches to Fermat and Alan playing around in Thunderbird 
               1 like they are really about to fly it
 
               into a mission.

               
                             ALAN
               Okay, Fermat. Run pre-flight checks.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Right. Hydraulic systems are green.

               FAB, Alan.

               
                             ALAN
               Couldn't hurt to just fire up the instruments.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               No wait, Alan! That's the(Thunderbird 
               1 begins to start up and Fermat shouts) 
               Wrong switch!
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Oh God. (There is loud beeping coming 
               from the control panel and the boys 
               can't shut down
 
               Thunderbird 1) Oh, could this day get any worse?

               
               Scene briefly changes to Jeff getting an alert in his office.

               (his face appears on a monitor in Thunderbird 
               1) Alan, my office. Now. (Thunderbird 
               1 shuts
 
               down)

               
                             FERMAT
               It just did.

               The boys walk out of Thunderbird 1 and are walking toward the 
               silo door. Fermat is running his hand
 
               on the nosecone of Thunderbird 1.

                             ALAN
               I can't believe it.

               
                             FERMAT
               We're so b-b-busted.

               
               Fermat's hand touches the goo that Mullion fired at Thunderbird 
               1 earlier.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Look at this.

               
                             ALAN
               What is it?

               
                             FERMAT
               Looks like some sort of, gallium-electrolyte 
               compound.
 
               
                             ALAN
               We gotta get out of here.

               
               Scene changes to Alan walking into his dad's office.

               
                             ALAN
               Dad, I know you're mad. I shouldn't 
               have been in the ship, but if you just 
               give me a minute to
 
               explain- (Jeff cuts him off)

               
                             JEFF
               You're damn right you shouldn't have 
               been in there!
 
               
                             ALAN
               But, nothing happened Dad. I had it 
               under control.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Under control? Do you have any idea 
               of the importance of secrecy in our 
               operation? You fired up
 
               a Thunderbird without activating the anti-detection shield. You 
               put everyone in danger when you act
 
               selfishly. You want to be part of the team, you have to play 
               by the rules. You understand? (Alan just
 
               looks at him) Do you?

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah, I understand. I understand you 
               don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You 
               don't want me to
 
               do anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell 
               you something important!
 
               
                             JEFF
               I've heard enough. You're grounded for 
               the rest of spring break.
 
               
                             ALAN
               But, Dad!

               
                             JEFF
               Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow 
               up.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Then let me. (he stalks toward the door 
               before whispering,) Please!
 
               
               Jeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the 
               video phone rings.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Hey, John. I was just about to turn 
               in. What can I do for you?
 
               
                             JOHN TRACY
               I could sure use a pizza. You know a 
               place that delivers?
 
               
                             JEFF
               30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything 
               else on your mind?
 
                             JOHN
               Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, 
               a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's 
               happening on
 
               Planet Tracy?

               
                             JEFF
               Alan's home for spring break.

               
                             JOHN
               Yeah, I thought I could see a storm 
               brewing in your region.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Teenagers.

               
                             JOHN
               Well, we've all been there. And Dad, 
               you've done a great job since Mom died.
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon 
               for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, 
               see if they need
 
               help with that fire.

               
                             JOHN
               FAB, Dad. Sleep tight.

               
               Fermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger.

               
                             FERMAT
               Morning, Dad.

               
                             BRAINS
               Hey, son. There's something I'd like 
               to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               The neural-net control system?

               
                             BRAINS
               It's great to have you back. I bet you 
               didn't think spring break was going 
               to be this w- w-fun.
 
               Watch this.

               
               Brains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone 
               in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole
 
               which is stationed behind his workplace.

               
                             BRAINS
               And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Dad?

               
               The neural-net control system short circuits.

               
                             BRAINS
               N-n-n- Almost perfect.

               
                             FERMAT
               There's something I want to talk to 
               you about.
 
               
                             BRAINS
               Oh. Right. Oh. OK, right. You're having 
               problems with a g-g-g-chi-chi-chi-wo-wo-female?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               N-no! No. Alan and I found some sort 
               of gallium compound on the nosecone 
               of Thunderbird
 
               1.

               
                             BRAINS
               We should check that out st-st-st-immediately.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               That'd be g-g-g-swell!

               Scene skips to Alan skipping rocks at the beach. The camera 
               follows one rock and it leads to a
 
               telescope coming out of the water. The telescope is connected 
               to the Hood's submarine.
 
               
                             MULLION
               The island is in sight.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Transom, I need you.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Yes, sir. Sir, our cloaking device has 
               evaded their detection
 
               systems. We have a positive visual from the tracking solution 
               on Thunderbird 1.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Mullion.

               
                             MULLION
               Sir? Sir, armed and ready. Shall I target 
               the main structure?
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Why would I want to destroy what will 
               soon be mine? One of the principle tenets 
               of Eastern
 
               martial arts is to use your opponent's strength against him.
 
               
               
               The Hood uses his powers to keep Mullion in place

               
                             MULLION
               (trying to move and realizing that he 
               can't) This is ridiculous.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               It will be almost impossible to force 
               the Thunderbirds to leave their island. 
               On the other
 
               hand, it requires no effort at all to let them go.

               
               The Hood stops using his powers on Mullion and Mullion falls 
               over.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               The Thunderbirds' purpose is to rescue. 
               All we need do is give them the victim. 
               (The Hood
 
               looks at Transom) Commence targeting.

               
                             TRANSOM
               Straightaway, sir. Target acquisition 
               of Thunderbird 5 is locked.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Fire.

               
               Transom fires a missile at Thunderbird 5.

               
               Scene switches to John on Thunderbird 5 when suddenly alarms 
               start to go off around him.
 
               
               
                             JOHN
               What the?

               
               
                             JOHN
               Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island. Mayday! 
               Mayday!
 
               
               Missile hits Thunderbird 5 and John is blow back into a wall 
               from the explosion. The scene then
 
               switches over to Tracy Island.

               
               Brains and Fermat run into Jeff's office.

               Switching to Command and Control Center. 
               (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate 
               Command
 
               and Control)

               
               The submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island.

               The children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and 
               see the submarine beginning to
 
               surface.

               Kyrano?

               
                             KYRANO
               Turns to the video phone that the Hood 
               has been using to communicate with Thunderbird 
               5.
 
               I'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead.

               
                             THE HOOD
               (Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take 
               them away.
 
               
                             MULLION
               Yes, sir.

               
               The kids lift their heads back up into the vents

               
                             ALAN
               Whoa.

               
                             TINTIN
               That makes The Hood my uncle?

               
                             FERMAT
               Every family has a black sh-sh- a black 
               sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command 
               and
 
               Control room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was 
               him that sneezed.)
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Turns to look at Alan) This room's 
               murder with my allergies.
 
               
               The kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what 
               is going on in the Command and Control
 
               room.

               
                             THE HOOD
               You left me to die that day. You may 
               have broken my body but you've no idea 
               how
 
               powerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, 
               waiting for a rescue that will
 
               never come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with 
               Thunderbird 5.)
 
               
                             JEFF
               Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then 
               the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, 
               status report.
 
               
                             SCOTT
               CO2 levels are rising.

               
                             JEFF
               Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to 
               the emergency batteries. Clean the air.
 
               
               
                             VIRGIL
               How long will that give us?

                             JOHN
               About four hours.

               
               Scene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and 
               Control room. Fermat begins to start
 
               sneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose 
               and mouth to try and muffle the sound.)
 
                             MULLION
               Someone's there. (Mullion walks over 
               to the ceiling, he is standing directly 
               below where
 
               they are. The kids are trying to leave the vents when his hand 
               shoots up through the ceiling and grabs
 
               Alan's ankle. He lets go after Tintin bites his hand and he gasps 
               in pain.)
 
               
               The children are now talking loudly and everyone in the Command 
               and Control room can hear them.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Run! Run!

               
                             ALAN
               No, jump! We can get through to the 
               silos.
 
               
               The children scream as they fall down a tunnel leading to the 
               silos. And the scene switches to the
 
               Command and Control room.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Apparently, the island is not as secure 
               as you thought. (he looks at the old 
               photos that were
 
               on Jeff's desk. Children! Did you find any children?

               
                             TRANSOM
               (Using the security cameras to see into 
               the silos) Here they are. Thunderbird 
               2 silo, in the
 
               loading arm.

               
               Mullion and two other guards run off to get them

               
                             THE HOOD
               (Speaking to Transom) Seal them in.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Hold on!

               
                             TINTIN
               The doors! You guys, let's go! C'mon
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Go! Go!

               
               The children reach the door that leads to Thunderbird 3's silo 
               just as it closes.
 
               
                             ALAN
               This way. (They run toward the still 
               closing Thunderbird 1 silo door.)
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               (After the door closes before they can 
               get through it) No!
 
               
                             TINTIN
               They've got us trapped. What now?

               
                             FERMAT
               If we can get to the Thunderbird 1's 
               silo, we can escape through the service 
               tunnel. But we
 
               need a plan, Alan.

               
                             ALAN
               I'll use the Thunderizer on the door.
 
               
               
               guards are in the elevator heading down to come get them)

               
                             ALAN
               You guys get the goons with the Firefly!
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Alan! This equipment is only to be used 
               in an emergency. (Alan and Tintin give 
               him looks) I
 
               guess this qualifies.

               
                             ALAN
               Yeah.

               
                             TINTIN
               Here they come. Fermat, can you drive 
               this thing?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Uh, no.

               
                             TINTIN
               Hey, watch it!

               
                             FERMAT
               I took microbiology, not driver's ed. 
               Set the pressure to maximum.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Got it.

               
                             MULLION
               (The guards walk out of the elevator 
               and see Tintin pointing the Firefly 
               at them) Retreat!
 
               (They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness 
               of the stuff fired at them)
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Let's move it.

               
                             ALAN
               That's it. Time to thunderize. (After 
               the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes!
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               Come on, let's go!

               
                             MULLION
               Get 'em!

               
                             ALAN
               Where's Fermat?

               
                             TINTIN
               Fermat!

               
                             ALAN
               Fermat!

               
                             FERMAT
               Coming!

               
                             ALAN
               Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 
               1's silo) What were you doing back there,
 
               
               Fermat?

               
                             FERMAT
               I had an-n-n idea.

               
                             ALAN
               Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open 
               the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan 
               types in a pass
 
               code)

               
                             ALAN
               (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell 
               when you see them coming. (tries another 
               pass code)
 
               
               Alan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can 
               see The Hood on the other side of
 
               the door. Alan turns back and sees him.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Alan. You can run if you want. Were 
               you surprised to hear what your father 
               did to me? It is
 
               frightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps 
               you already suspected that about
 
               your father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do 
               you suppose it was guilt? Because he
 
               let your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, 
               Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head
 
               no) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries 
               to use his powers on Alan but nothing
 
               happens)

               
                             ALAN
               (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't 
               go this way. He's there.
 
               
               The Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the 
               other guards appear at the other
 
               doorway, leaving the children trapped.

               
                             FERMAT
               No! (he falls slightly) Ow. What are 
               we gonna do, Alan?
 
               
                             ALAN
               I don't know. I'm thinking, okay? (Alan 
               looks at the control panel behind the 
               Hood and sees a
 
               button that will open part of the floor under Thunderbird 1. 
               Keep backing up. I've got an idea. (Alan
 
               takes his rock launcher from the pouch it is in on the back of 
               his pants. and fires it at the button, but
 
               misses.)

               
                             TINTIN
               That's your idea?

               
                             THE HOOD
               It's not me you're angry at, Alan.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               It's not you I'm aiming at. (Alan fires 
               another rock and this time hits the 
               button and the floor
 
               drops out from underneath Tintin, Fermat, and Alan. Tintin, Fermat, 
               and Alan scream as they fall.)
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Get them!

               
                             MULLION
               Transom, fire up Thunderbird 1. And 
               set it on broil!
 
               
               The kids look behind them while they are falling down the tunnel 
               and see the flames coming from
 
               Thunderbird 1 behind them. Tintin screams even louder. The tunnel 
               opens up and leads to the ocean.
 
               
               Back in Command and Control

               
                             TRANSOM
               No sign of them.

               
                             MULLION
               Of course not, the little brats went 
               up like firecrackers. Pop, pop, pop! 
               (laughs at Brains and
 
               Brains moves to punch him.)

               
                             THE HOOD
               Don't, give him the satisfaction, Professor. 
               This is taking too long. Pick out the 
               equipment
 
               you need to get into those banks and load it into Thunderbird 
               2. No more delays.
 
               
                             MULLION
               Yes, sir.

               Scene switches to the children trying to get onto the beach, 
               they are getting knocked over by a couple
 
               of waves. Fermat is coughing and spluttering.

               
                             FERMAT
               How about a little warning next time 
               you pull a stunt like that?
 
               
                             ALAN
               Relax, Fermat. It's just a little water.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               I could have drowned.

               
                             ALAN

               I said I was sorry, Fermat. Just put 
               this behind us, Okay? We gotta watch 
               each other's backs.
 
               Nice drawers.

               
                             FERMAT
               Thank you.

               Boo!

               
                             ALAN
               No, c'mon Tintin, stay there.

               
                             TINTIN
               You're worse than a couple of girls. 
               Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat) 
               Those are nice
 
               drawers!

               Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 
               5 via satellite, right?
 
               
                             ALAN
               Right.

               
                             FERMAT
               So, there's a miniscule possibility 
               that if we reach the satellite station, 
               we could
 
               
                             ALAN
               Blow it up!

               
                             FERMAT
               No, we could hack in to it and give 
               control back to Thunderbird 5.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's 
               do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan 
               in the sand) Here's the
 
               plan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the 
               base of the mountain to the access road,
 
               here. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think?
 
               
               
                             TINTIN
               Good. Except that we're here, not there, 
               and the transmitter is there, not here. 
               We have to go
 
               through the jungle.

               
                             FERMAT
               But that's f-f- off limits.

                             TINTIN
               It's gonna be dangerous.

               
                             ALAN
               I'm in. (All three of them put their 
               hands together) We gotta get up there 
               fast! All our folks are
 
               in trouble and if The Hood gets off the island

                             LADY PENELOPE
               Parker?

               
                             PARKER
               Milady?

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               We have an emergency.

                             LADY PENELOPE
               What a charming fellow.

               
               Someone knocks on the door.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Come in.

               
               Parker enters Lady Penelope's bathroom, with tea, where she is 
               up to her shoulders in bubble bath.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Have a look at this, Parker. (There 
               is a computer monitor near her feet.) 
               He, and this
 
               woman, poor girl, both work for this man, known as The Hood.
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               Sounds like an alias, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Quite right, Parker. Real name: Trangh 
               Belagant. Assumed dead when
 
               
               his illegal diamond mine collapsed in the jungles of the Malaya. 
               (takes a sip of tea) Oh, perfect, Parker.
 
               The Thunderbirds rescued over 500 mine workers, including Mr. 
               Belagant's brother.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Milady, that's Mr. Tracy's loyal manservant, 
               Kyrano.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               How's my schedule, Parker?

               
                             PARKER
               You have clay pigeon shooting with Lord 
               Marlborough, a benefit gala for the 
               Institute of the
 
               Blind, and incidentally there's a typhoon bearing down on Singapore.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               I suppose that's urgent.

               
                             PARKER
               Yes, milady. There was also a bridge 
               collapsed in Buenos Aires and a volcanic 
               eruption in
 
               Jakarta.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               The Thunderbirds haven't responded?
 
               
               
                             PARKER
               No, milady. And the media is awash in 
               speculation vis-à-vis their whereabouts. 
               Parker turns on
 
               the news.

               
                             CHUCK

               Chuck, disaster after disaster around 
               the world today and still no sight of 
               the Thunderbirds.
 
               Typhoon Jago hit land in Singapore just one hour ago and thousands 
               have been left homeless by a
 
               volcano in Jakarta. Only the Thunderbirds have the incredible 
               machines
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               I think it's time to send the emergency 
               signal, Parker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               I fear you're not wrong, milady.

               
                             LISA LOWE
               Lisa Lowe. Back to you, Chuck.

               
               Parker hits the top of the tea pot and a light pops out and begins 
               to blink and beep. Back on Tracy
 
               Island a similar light begins to flash and bleep but Brains is 
               unable to get up to get to it because he is

                             LADY PENELOPE
               Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough 
               that I've broken my shooting arm. We

               No way. They're dead. No one could live

                             TINTIN
               (Reaches the top of the mountain) Okay, 
               guys, take five.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Still finishing climbing up the mountain)Five 
               isn't going to do it!
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Guys?

               
               Alan and Fermat reach the top of the mountain, they are both 
               puffing and panting. Tintin smiles at
 
               them before she sees a scorpion on Alan's shoulder.

               
                             TINTIN
               Don't move.

               
                             FERMAT
               (Sees scorpion when he stands up next 
               to Alan) Whoa
 
               
                             ALAN
               What is it?

               
                             TINTIN
               Hexdrotilous scorpion.

               
                             ALAN
               Is that dangerous?

               
                             FERMAT
               .025 milligrams of its venom is fatal.
 
               
               
                             ALAN
               So, dangerous is in fact an understatement.
 
               
               
               Tintin uses powers just like her uncle, The Hood, to lift the 
               scorpion off of Alan's shoulder and lets it
 
               fall to the ground.

               
                             FERMAT
               Watch out!

               
                             ALAN
               Tintin, what was that?

               
                             TINTIN
               Let's get going.

                             ALAN
               Hey! She has the same powers as her 
               uncle, The Hood.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               You think?

               
                             ALAN
               Must run in the family. Did you do that?
 
               
               
                             TINTIN
               Just drop it, okay?

               
                             ALAN
               Still think everything can be explained 
               by science?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Not girls!

               
               Scene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then 
               an explosion near Scott and Gordon.

               Scene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching 
               the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and
 
               Fermat.

                             FERMAT
               Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate 
               equipment. (The circuit board sparks.) 
               Which is
 
               now b-b-broken.

                             FERMAT
               Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something 
               to solder with.
 
               
                             ALAN

               like that. (Tintin
 
               and Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What?

               
               Alan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's 
               retainer.
 
               
                             ALAN

                             TINTIN
               Gee Alan, I never figured you for a 
               crybaby.

               I'm gonna kill you.

               
                             FERMAT

                             TINTIN
               I think it was some sort of apology.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! 
               Okay, first step is to establish contact

               I said no problem.

               
                             TINTIN
               Guys, let's go we've got to get out 
               of here. What is this?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               It's a hoversled.

               
                             ALAN
               It's our ticket out, unless you've got 
               a better idea.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Yeah, let's wait for Lady Penelope, 
               like your dad said.
 
               
                             FERMAT
               (Hands Tintin the seat to the hoversled) 
               Here.
 
                             ALAN
               Great plan. Let's sit and wait to get 
               caught. I say we do something. Now! 
               Right, Fermat?
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Actually, I agree with Tintin. I don't 
               think this is s-s-safe.
 
               
                             ALAN
               You don't think anything is s s-safe.
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Just because I s-s-stutter doesn't mean 
               that I'm wrong. If we're a team, we 
               should make
 
               decisions as a team.

               Do you guys want to sit here and take 
               a vote? Or do you want to get out of 
               here? Cuz I'm going.

               You can be a real jerk sometimes.

               on the hoversled.

               Tintin and Fermat fall off the hoversled screaming and at Mullion's 
               feet.

               Oh, no.
 
               
               Scene switches to Mullion walking Tintin and Fermat to a door 
               in the Tracy house.

               We have an unidentified craft approaching 
               the island at high speed.
 
               
               Scene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's 
               car approaching.

               No, it's not. There's still time. We've

               He's a Tracy.

               
               Scene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and 
               then to Lady Penelope and Parker
 
               walking up to the Tracy house

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               This doesn't look good, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               No, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, 
               and someone should do something about
 
               
               that hideous hammock.

                             THE HOOD
               (After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) 
               Whom do we have here? Mullion.
 
               
                             MULLION
               I must warn you that I know judo, krai 
               magna, and tae kwon do.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               And I know Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Milady.

               
                             MULLION
               (After Parker punches him in the face) 
               You've broken my nose.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Yes, that was very much the intention 
               of the maneuver.
 
               
                             TRANSOM
               (After she tries to attack Lady Penelope 
               and Lady Penelope pushes her over) Whoa!
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               One tries so hard in life to sort things 
               out on an intellectual-slash-conversational 
               level.
 
               sometimes it's just not possible.

               
               Lady Penelope continues to fight Transom and Parker continues 
               to fight Mullion, the Hood is watching
 
               them.

               
                             PARKER
               (after Mullion threw him against a metal 
               cabinet) Shall I bring the car around, 
               milady?
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Parker, have a bit of a lie-down.

               
                             PARKER
               (Sees Mullion behind Lady Penelope) 
               Excuse me, milady. (punches him and 
               after that has no
 
               effect he picks up a frying pan and hits Mullion)

               
               Transom goes back to fighting Lady Penelope and Mullion is fighting 
               Parker.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Ah, Lady Penelope! Of course he has 
               his palace. Why not his princess?
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Flattery will get you nowhere. (after 
               she blocks the metal bar that Transom 
               was trying
 
               to hit her with) Ow! Have you any idea what a manicure costs 
               these days?
 
               
                             PARKER
               (Is pushing Mullion forward) Coming 
               through, milady.
 
               
               The camera quickly pans a little bit outside to show Alan hidden 
               behind some shrubs watching the
 
               fight.

               
                             PARKER
               (After the Hood uses his powers to throw 
               a sofa at them) Duck, milady!
 
               
                             ALAN
               He's weak. Using his power makes him 
               weak. (The Hood, having heard something 
               looks over
 
               toward where Alan)

               
                             THE HOOD
               You're formidable opponent Lady Penelope. 
               More than a match for most men.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               That's not saying much, then, is it?
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               (uses his powers to stop the punch that 
               Parker was about to throw at him) I 
               suggest you
 
               let us pass.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Don't try your parlor games on me you 
               sad, little man. You've committed a 
               serious
 
               crime trespassing on this island. And in about (looks at Parker's 
               watch) four seconds, I'm going to get
 
               quite cross with you. (the Hood uses his powers to stop her foot 
               which was about to come up and kick
 
               him.)

               
                             THE HOOD
               (with his back still to Alan) How are 
               you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker 
               and Lady
 
               Penelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into 
               the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm
 
               going to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope 
               and they cry out in pain again)
 
               You can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out 
               again) You have something that belongs
 
               to me.

               
                             PARKER
               Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't 
               the first time my head's been pulverized. 
               And it's never
 
               done any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers 
               on them and they cry out in pain
 
               louder this time)

               
                             ALAN
               (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! 
               Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the 
               guidance processor
 
               toward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it 
               over to him before it can hit the water)
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give 
               you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put 
               them with the
 
               others. (Transom grabs Parker)

               
                             MULLION
               (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming 
               with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws 
               Lady

               I'm so sorry, Fermat.

               (trying to figure out how to open the

                             PARKER
               Thank you, milady. Unfortunately, I 
               fear I shall need a piece of wire to 
               access the mechanism.

                             PARKER
               Most certainly, milady.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE

               We're getting reports of some kind of

               Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where 
               Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu 
               landing,
 
               causing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there 
               has been no emergency call from this
 
               area so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at 
               all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck
 
               but Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine.

               Sir, if we continue on our present course, 
               we'll sever the monorail's subterranean 
               supports.
 
               Shall I correct our position?

                             THE HOOD

               ever liked was winning.
 
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               How ghastly.

               
               Scene changes to Alan and Jeff in Thunderbird 1.

               
                             ALAN
               Hey, Dad. That stuff The Hood said, 
               about you leaving him to die. He was 
               lying, right?
 
               
                             JEFF
               No. See, you can't save everyone, Alan. 
               It doesn't matter how hard you try or 
               how brave you are.
 
               It doesn't even matter if it's someone you love, someone you'd 
               give your life in a second to save. You
 
               just can't save everyone.

               
                             ALAN
               What was Mom like?

               
                             JEFF
               She was a lot like you. Come on, we've 
               got a job to do.
 
               
               Scene switches to Lady Penelope being handcuffed at the Bank 
               of London.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Finish her off, Mullion.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Shame on you. I always despise a man 
               who delegates the important jobs. (sees 
               the
 
               look Mullion is giving her) Oh, dream on, sad act. (Mullion chuckles 
               and walks away.)
 
               
               Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Tintin, and Fermat about to enter 
               the Bank of London when Parker pulls
 
               up.

                             JEFF
               Good timing, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Good afternoon Mr. Tracy.

               
                             JEFF
               Come with us.

               
                             PARKER
               My pleasure, Mr. Tracy.

               
               Scene switches to The Hood talking to Mullion and Transom.

               
                             THE HOOD
               The Thunderbirds. They're here. Kill 
               them all.
 
               
               Scene switches to Jeff, Alan, Parker, Tintin, and Fermat inside 
               the Bank of London.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Alan, you guys stay here with Parker. 
               I'm gonna go find Lady Penelope.
 
               
                             ALAN
               But what about The Hood? (Alan points 
               behind Parker) Look out, Parker! (When 
               Parker turns
 
               away Alan runs after his dad.)

               
                             PARKER
               Master Tracy!

               
                             FERMAT
               Look out, Parker!

               
                             PARKER
               Alright, that's enough of that.

               
                             MULLION
               (from behind Parker) Don't move. (Parker 
               motions for the kids to run forward 
               but Transom
 
               blocks them. Parker puts his hands up as if to punch her)

               
                             TRANSOM
               Go on, then.

               
                             PARKER
               No, sorry. I can't hit a lady.

               
                             TINTIN
               Allow me. (she kick Transom and runs 
               off, Transom chases her)
 
               
                             MULLION
               (To Fermat) I've been waiting to get 
               my hands on you brats.
 
               
                             PARKER
               And I've been waiting to get my hands 
               on you.
 
               
               They brawl for a few seconds before Mullion lands a good punch 
               on Parker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               Ow, now that was a punch.

               
                             FERMAT
               Parker, can we wrap this up?

               
                             PARKER
               What did you have in mind, Master Hackenbacker?
 
               
               
                             FERMAT
               Strategically speaking, the best odds 
               of success lie with the Parker Haymaker.
 
               
                             PARKER
               I concur. (they knock Mullion out)
 
               
               
               Scene changes to Jeff running into the room that Lady Penelope 
               is being held captive in
 
               
                             JEFF
               Penny!

               
                             PENNY
               Jeff, no!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Did you save them all this time, Jeff? 
               Or did you leave someone behind?
 
               
                             JEFF
               I didn't make you what you are.

               
                             THE HOOD
               It's not me you have to convince. (motions 
               his head toward the entrance of the 
               room
 
               where Alan is standing)

               
                             JEFF
               Leave my son out of this- (the Hood 
               uses his powers to throw Jeff into the 
               cage that Lady
 
               Penelope is handcuffed in)

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Jeff!

               
                             ALAN
               Dad! (Alan runs toward the closing cage 
               door and reaches it right as it slams 
               shut) Dad! Dad!
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I'm disappointed in you, Alan. I thought 
               we were kindred spirits.
 
               
                             ALAN
               Well, we're not. I'm Jeff Tracy's son.
 
               
               
                             THE HOOD
               You certainly are. (Alan runs at him)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               No!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Alan no! (The Hood uses his powers to 
               throw Alan off to the side where he 
               slams
 
               into a wall)

               
                             JEFF
               Alan!

               
               The Hood looks dazed but then uses his powers to fly up to the 
               catwalk above the Mole. The scene
 
               then switches to Tintin being chased by Transom running into 
               a cage.
 
               
                             TRANSOM
               Come here, you little minx! (Tintin 
               jumps up on a bar and flips to the other 
               side while
 
               Transom runs into the wall) Ow!

               
                             TINTIN
               (Closing the cage door) Bye-bye.

               
               Scene switches back to the room with The Hood, Alan, Jeff, and 
               Lady Penelope.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Alan, stay back.

                             THE HOOD
               You want so desperately to walk in Daddy's 
               footsteps. (uses his powers to lift 
               Alan off the
 
               floor and makes him start choking himself with his own hands)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Let him go.

               
                             THE HOOD
               Did you really think you could challenge 
               me?
 
               
                             JEFF
               Let him go, please.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Let him go.

               
                             JEFF
               Please! Let him go! (the Hood tightens 
               his hold of Alan and then releases him)
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Alan! Are you all right?

               
                             JEFF
               Alan, get out. Run!

               
                             ALAN
               He's getting weaker. He can't last much 
               longer.
 
               
                             JEFF
               Neither can you! (Alan begins to climb 
               up the Mole to reach the Hood) Alan, 
               no! Look out! (The
 
               Hood starts the Mole with his powers and Alan has to jump and 
               grab the railing of the catwalk) Alan!
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               I'm glad you could be here to see this, 
               Jeff. (steps on one of Alan's hands 
               until he cries in
 
               pain and lets go)

               
                             THE HOOD
               Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand 
               and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs 
               into the room)
 
               
                             TINTIN
               No!

               
                             THE HOOD
               Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses 
               her powers on him as well) Oh!
 
               
               (The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood 
               dangling above the still active Mole.
 
               
                             THE HOOD
               Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases 
               one hand from the railing) Like your 
               father did.
 
               
                             ALAN
               I don't want to save your life. (the 
               Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan 
               grabs it) But it's what we
 
               do.

               
               Scene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to 
               a police car outside the Bank of
 
               London when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them.

               
                             THE HOOD
               See you soon, Jeff.

               
                             PARKER
               (To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the 
               car) Now, that was definitely showing 
               off.
 
               
               Scene changes to back at Tracy Island. Scott, Virgil, John, and 
               Gordon are playing in the pool. Jeff is
 
               grilling with Lady Penelope standing next to him. Fermat is getting 
               swimming lessons from his dad
 
               and Alan is watching.

                             VIRGIL
               Hey, Scott.

               
                             SCOTT
               Get him!

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               (To Jeff) What did you put in these 
               margaritas?
 
               
                             JEFF
               It's a Tracy secret.

               
                             BRAINS
               (To Fermat) That's my boy! One more 
               week and you're gonna be swimming like 
               a F-f-f-D-d-d-
 
               Sha-sha- sha-Aquatic creature.

               
                             ALAN
               Good job, Ferm.

               
                             TINTIN
               (To Alan as she spins around) So, what 
               do you think?
 
               
                             ALAN
               He's getting there. (Looks at Tintin) 
               Whoa, Tintin! You're just really, um, 
               blossoming.
 
               
                             TINTIN
               Ew! Did you say "blossoming"? (smiles 
               at him)
 
               
                             JEFF
               (rings a triangle) Gather around everybody. 
               I have an announcement to make. Tonight 
               is a special
 
               night. We're all together because of three very special people. 
               Fermat, Tintin, Alan. The world needs
 
               Thunderbirds and the Thunderbirds need you. (gives each of them 
               International Rescue pins)
 
               
                             FERMAT
               Mr. Tracy!

               
                             TINTIN
               Thank you, sir. (Camera pans quickly 
               over to Parker who is tearing up)
 
               
               
                             JEFF
               Congratulations, Alan. No short cuts. 
               You earned it. You all did.
 
               
                             PARKER
               (To Onaha and Kyrano) I'm not usually 
               an emotional man, but sometimes even 
               the toughest
 
               nut must crack.

               
                             VIRGIL
               (As all four of Alan's brothers walk 
               over to ruffle his hair and congratulate 
               him) Hey, way to go,
 
               sprout!

               
                             JOHN
               That's my boy, Alan! That's my brother. 
               (Fermat and Alan are thrown into the 
               pool by Scott,
 
               John, Virgil, and Gordon who jump in after them)

               
                             JEFF
               (answering his phone after it rings) 
               Yes, Madam President. I see. Of course, 
               straightaway. Boys.
 
               Sorry, Penny. Duty calls.

               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Of course it does. And quite right too.
 
               
               
               Scene switches to all five Tracy boys lined up in their uniforms 
               about to go on a rescue mission. The
 
               older four are looking at Alan.

               
                             JEFF
               Thunderbirds are go!

               Scene switches to Lady Penelope and Parker in a pink pedal boat
 
               
               
                             LADY PENELOPE
               Fast as you can, Parker.

               
                             PARKER
               Certainly, milady.

               
               Credits Roll with music by Busted playing in the background
 
               
               
                             BUSTED
               Thunderbirds Are Go

               If someone evils coming round they should be frightened (frightened)
 
               
               Cause now the boys are back in town. No strings to hold them 
               down down.

               Kids are learning fast they know the t-birds kick some ass

               Be sure that there's no coming last cause you're on their side 
               (their side)
 
               
               It always looks so cool when spaceships come out of the pool
 
               
               You know that you'd just be a fool to be a bad guy (bad guy) 
               
               
               Cause now the boys are back in town no strings to hold them down 
               down.

               Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go

               
               Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go

               
               Thunderbirds are, Thunderbirds are go
